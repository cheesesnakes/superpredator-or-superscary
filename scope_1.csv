This has led to recent endeavours to promote the transparency, rigour, and ultimately, replicability of research. Originating from this zeitgeist, the challenge to discuss critical issues on terminology, design, methods, and analysis considerations in fear conditioning research is taken up by this work, which involved representatives from fourteen of the major human fear conditioning laboratories in Europe. This compendium is intended to provide a basis for the development of a common procedural and terminology framework for the field of human fear conditioning. Whenever possible, we give general recommendations. When this is not feasible, we provide evidence-based guidance for methodological decisions on study design, outcome measures, and analyses. Importantly, this work is also intended to raise awareness and initiate discussions on crucial questions with respect to data collection, processing, statistical analyses, the impact of subtle procedural changes, and data reporting specifically tailored to the research on fear conditioning.

Fear of humans has been proposed to act as a substitute, but new research identifies humans as a super predator globally far more lethal to mesocarnivores, and thus presumably far more frightening. Although much of the world now consists of human-dominated landscapes, there remains relatively little research regarding how behavioral responses to humans affect trophic networks, to the extent that no study has yet experimentally tested the relative fearfulness mesocarnivores demonstrate in reaction to humans versus nonhuman predators. Badgers (Meles meles) in Britain are a model mesocarnivore insofar as they no longer need fear native large carnivores (bears, Ursus arctos; wolves, Canis lupus) and now perhaps fear humans more. We tested the fearfulness badgers demonstrated to audio playbacks of extant (dog) and extinct (bear and wolf) large carnivores, and humans, by assaying the suppression of foraging behavior. Hearing humans affected latency to feed, vigilance, foraging time, number of feeding visits, and number of badgers feeding. Hearing dogs and bears had far lesser effects on latency to feed, and hearing wolves had no effects. Our results indicate fear of humans evidently cannot substitute for the fear large carnivores inspire in mesocarnivores because humans are perceived as far more frightening, which we discuss in light of the recovery of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.","[Clinchy, Michael; Zanette, Liana Y.; Roberts, Devin; Suraci, Justin P.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Suraci, Justin P.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC V8L 3Y3, Canada; [Buesching, Christina D.; Newman, Chris; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House, Tubney OX13 5QL, England",,"Clinchy, M (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",mclinchy@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; UK People's Trust for Endangered Species Grant,This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants to M.C. and L.Y.Z. and a UK People's Trust for Endangered Species Grant to D.W.M.,,56,73,74,9,98,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Where both disturbance types co-occur, disentangling their impacts remains a challenge. Disturbance effects may interact such that species respond to increased human footprint by either reducing (habituation) or increasing (sensitization) avoidance of human presence. We experimentally manipulated perceived human presence, using playbacks of people talking, across a gradient of human footprint in California's Santa Cruz Mountains and used camera traps to quantify the behavioral responses of bobcats (Lynx rufus), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), mesopredators known to exhibit strong fear response to human presence, but which vary in their use of developed areas. Bobcats and skunks reduced activity in response to human playbacks but showed no change in responsiveness to playbacks across the gradient of human footprint, suggesting that these species are similarly fearful of humans at all infrastructure development levels tested. Opossums exhibited a significant interaction between human footprint and playback treatment such that reductions in activity level in response to human playbacks were strongest at higher levels of building density. Our results indicate that, rather than habituating to human presence some mesopredators retain a strong fear of humans or become more fearful when inhabiting more developed areas. We suggest that consistently high responsiveness to immediate human presence may benefit mesopredators living in human-dominated landscapes by mitigating the risk of anthropogenic mortality. Mesopredators remain fearful of humans, whether they are in remote, protected areas, or in the backyards of densely populated suburbs. Using an experimental approach, we show that bobcats and striped skunks exhibit a consistent fear response to people, regardless of level of human footprint. Meanwhile, Virginia opossums exhibit heightened fear in areas of high human disturbance. Maintaining a strong fear response to humans may help mesopredators coexist in human-dominated landscapes.","[Reilly, Chloe M.; Suraci, Justin P.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, Truckee, CA 96161 USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wang, Yiwei] San Francisco Bay Bird Observ, 524 Valley Way, Milpitas, CA 95035 USA",,"Reilly, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",cmreilly@ucsc.edu,,,Resources Legacy Fund; Peninsula Open Space Trust,"This work was supported by the Resources Legacy Fund and the Peninsula Open Space Trust.

One frequently used paradigm is measurement of the acoustic startle reflex under conditions that mimic anxiogenic and fear-related conditions. For example, fear-potentiated startle is the relative increase in the frequency or magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex in the presence of a previously neutral cue (e.g., colored shape; termed the conditioned stimulus or CS+) that has been repeatedly paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (e.g., airblast to the larynx). Our group has recently used fear-potentiated startle paradigms to demonstrate impaired fear extinction in civilian and combat populations with PTSD. In the current study, we examined the use of either auditory or visual CSs in a fear extinction protocol that we have validated and applied to human clinical conditions. This represents an important translational bridge in that numerous animal studies of fear extinction, upon which much of the human work is based, have employed the use of auditory CSs as opposed to visual CSs. Participants in both the auditory and visual groups displayed robust fear-potentiated startle to the CS+, clear discrimination between the reinforced CS+ and non-reinforced CS-, significant extinction to the previously reinforced CS+, and marked spontaneous recovery. We discuss the current results as they relate to future investigations of PTSD-related impairments in fear processing in populations with diverse medical and psychiatric histories.","[Norrholm, Seth D.; Anderson, Kemp M.; Olin, Ilana W.; Kwon, Cliffe; Warren, Victor T.; McCarthy, Alexander; Bosshardt, Lauren; Sabree, Justin; Duncan, Erica J.; Bradley, Bekh] Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line, Trauma Recovery Program, Decatur, GA 30033 USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Anderson, Kemp M.; Olin, Ilana W.; Jovanovic, Tanja; Kwon, Cliffe; Warren, Victor T.; McCarthy, Alexander; Bosshardt, Lauren; Duncan, Erica J.; Rothbaum, Barbara O.; Bradley, Bekh] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Sabree, Justin] Oglethorpe Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Norrholm, SD (corresponding author), Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line 116A, 1670 Clairmont Rd,Suite 1E 113C, Decatur, GA 30033 USA.",snorrho@emory.edu,"Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022; Duncan, Erica/B-1671-2016; Bradley, Bekh/H-8399-2012","Bradley, Bekh/0000-0003-1838-0702; McCarthy, Ilana/0000-0002-3305-2478","National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD)French National Research Agency (ANR)NARSAD; Department of Defense (DoD)/Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) [W81XWH-08-2-0170]; Emory University Research Committee; PHS Grant from the Clinical and Translational Science Award Program [UL1 RR025008]; National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR); NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH092576, U19MH069056-03, R34MH083078-01A1, 1R01MH70880-01-A2]; NARSADNARSAD; Emory Care Medical Foundation; National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [1R01DA018294-01A2]; VA Merit Review ProgramUS Department of Veterans Affairs; Department of Defense Clinical Trial GrantUnited States Department of Defense [W81XWH-10-1- 1045]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000454] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [UL1RR025008] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Dr. Norrholm has research support from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD), the Department of Defense (DoD)/Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP; # W81XWH-08-2-0170), the Emory University Research Committee, and the PHS Grant (UL1 RR025008) from the Clinical and Translational Science Award Program, National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources.

Oxytocin reduces anxiety and impacts on fear conditioning and extinction. Recently, oxytocin administration in humans was shown to increase trust, suggesting involvement of the amygdala, a central component of the neurocircuitry of fear and social cognition that has been linked to trust and highly expresses oxytocin receptors in many mammals. However, no human data on the effects of this peptide on brain function were available. Here, we show that human amygdala function is strongly modulated by oxytocin. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to image amygdala activation by fear-inducing visual stimuli in 15 healthy males after double-blind crossover intranasal application of placebo or oxytocin. Compared with placebo, oxytocin potently reduced activation of the amygdala and reduced coupling of the amygdala to brainstem regions implicated in autonomic and behavioral manifestations of fear. Our results indicate a neural mechanism for the effects of oxytocin in social cognition in the human brain and provide a methodology and rationale for exploring therapeutic strategies in disorders in which abnormal amygdala function has been implicated, such as social phobia or autism.","NIMH, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Giessen, Ctr Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Cognit Neurosci Grp, D-35385 Giessen, Germany; NIMH, Neuroimaging Core Facil, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Unit Syst Neurosci Psychiat, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Meyer-Lindenberg, A (corresponding author), NIMH, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 10-3C103,9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",andreasml@nih.gov,"Kirsch, Peter/C-2499-2008; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas/H-1076-2011","Kirsch, Peter/0000-0002-0817-1248; Lis, Stefanie/0000-0002-8051-2756; Mier, Daniela/0000-0003-2518-7492; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas/0000-0001-5619-1123",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [Z01MH002867] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA Funding Source: Medline,,,39,1118,1137,7,282,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Extinguished fear often reappears after extinction through spontaneous recovery. Animal studies suggest that spontaneous recovery can be abolished if extinction occurs within minutes of acquisition. However, a limited number of human extinction studies have shown that short interval extinction does not prevent the return of fear. For this reason. we performed an in-depth parametric analysis of human fear extinction using fear-potentiated startle. Using separate single-cue and differential conditioning paradigms, participants were fear conditioned and then underwent extinction either 10 min (Immediate) or 72 hr (Delayed) later. Testing for spontaneous recovery occurred 96 hr after acquisition. In the single cue paradigm, the Immediate and Delayed groups exhibited differences in context, but not fear, conditioning. With differential conditioning, there were no differences in context conditioning and the Immediate group displayed less spontaneous recovery. Thus, the results remain inconclusive regarding spontaneous recovery and the timing of extinction and are discussed in terms of performing translational studies of fear in humans.","[Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja; Boshoven, William; Davis, Michael; Rothbaum, Barbara; Duncan, Erica J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja; Boshoven, William; Duncan, Erica J.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30033 USA; [Vervliet, Bram] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Vervliet, Bram] Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Louvain, Belgium; [Myers, Karyn M.] Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Norrholm, SD (corresponding author), Atlanta VAMC, 1670 Clairmont Rd,MHSL 116A, Decatur, GA 30033 USA.",seth.norrholm@va.gov,"Vervliet, Bram/AAE-6276-2019; Jovanovic, Tanja/K-4095-2014; Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022; Duncan, Erica/B-1671-2016","Jovanovic, Tanja/0000-0002-6456-0053; Vervliet, Bram/0000-0002-5904-4257","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50 MH058922, R37 MH047840, R24 MH067314, R37 MH47840, 1R24MH067314-01A1, 2P50 MH058922] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH058922, R37MH047840, R24MH067314] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,41,82,84,1,18,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

We examined whether a threat-relevant predator odor (2-methyl-2-thiazoline) would contextually enhance the formation of human fear memory associations. Participants who learned to associate visual stimuli with electric shock in this predator odor context later showed stronger fear responses to the visual stimuli than participants who learned in an aversiveness-matched control odor context. This effect generalized to testing in another odor context, even after extinction training. Results of a separate experiment indicate that a possible biological mechanism for this effect may be increased cortisol levels in a predator odor context. These results suggest that innate olfactory processes can play an important role in human fear learning. Modulatory influences of odor contexts may partly explain the sometimes maladaptive persistence of human fear memory, e.g., in post-traumatic stress disorders.","[Taylor, Jessica E.; Lau, Hakwan; Kawato, Mitsuo; Koizumi, Ai] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback DecNef, Computat Neurosci Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Lau, Hakwan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Lau, Hakwan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Seymour, Ben; Kawato, Mitsuo; Koizumi, Ai] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Osaka, Japan; [Seymour, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Computat & Biol Learning Lab, Cambridge, England; [Seymour, Ben] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Cognit Mech Labs, Dept Neural Computat Decis Making, Kyoto, Japan; [Nakae, Aya] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Osaka, Japan; [Sumioka, Hidenobu] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Hiroshi Ishiguro Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Koizumi, Ai] Sony Comp Sci Labs Inc, Tokyo, Japan",,"Taylor, JE; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback DecNef, Computat Neurosci Labs, Kyoto, Japan.; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Osaka, Japan.; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Sony Comp Sci Labs Inc, Tokyo, Japan.",jessie.elizabeth.taylor@gmail.com; bellkoizumi@gmail.com,"Sumioka, Hidenobu/AAA-7026-2021","Sumioka, Hidenobu/0000-0003-1511-9525; Kawato, Mitsuo/0000-0001-8185-1197","ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan); Brain/Mind Beyond program of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [JP19dm0307008]; JT presto [JPMJPR18J3]; Versus ArthritisVersus Arthritis [21537]","This work was supported by the ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan), by the Brain/Mind Beyond program of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (JP19dm0307008), by JT presto (JPMJPR18J3), and by Versus Arthritis: 21537.",,59,5,5,4,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

However, a significant number of patients fail to maintain their gains, partly attributed to the fact that this inhibitory learning and its maintenance is temporary and conditioned fear responses can return. Animal studies have shown that activation of the cannabinoid system during extinction learning enhances fear extinction and its retention. Specifically, CB1 receptor agonists, such as Delta 9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), can facilitate extinction recall by preventing recovery of extinguished fear in rats. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in humans. We conducted a study using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design, coupling a standard Pavlovian fear extinction paradigm and simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) recording with an acute pharmacological challenge with oral dronabinol (synthetic THC) or placebo (PBO) 2 h prior to extinction learning in 29 healthy adult volunteers (THC = 14; PBO = 15) and tested extinction retention 24 h after extinction learning. Compared to subjects that received PBO, subjects that received THC showed low SCR to a previously extinguished CS when extinction memory recall was tested 24 h after extinction learning, suggesting that THC prevented the recovery of fear. These results provide the first evidence that pharmacological enhancement of extinction learning is feasible in humans using cannabinoid system modulators, which may thus warrant further development and clinical testing.

Our analysis of 136 effect sizes, derived from 68 independent samples and 9,544 participants, included studies that experimentally manipulated fear or measured naturally varying levels of fear or anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical samples, and studies measuring risky decision making and risk estimation. A multilevel random effects model estimated a small to moderate average effect size (r = 0.22), such that fear was related to decreased risky decision making and increased risk estimation. There was also high heterogeneity in the effect sizes. Moderator analyses showed that effect sizes were greater when risk tasks used tangible (e.g. monetary) outcomes and when studies used clinically anxious participants. However, there also remained considerable variability in effect sizes, the sources of which remain unknown. We posit several potential factors that may contribute to observed variability in this effect for future study, including factors concerning both the nature of fear experience and the risk taking context.","[Wake, Sean; Satpute, Ajay B.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wormwood, Jolie] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Psychol, Durham, NH 03824 USA",,"Satpute, AB (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",a.satpute@northeastern.edu,,"Satpute, Ajay/0000-0003-0227-0816","National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [U01CA193632]; Department of Graduate Education of the National Science Foundation, NCS [1835309]; Division of Graduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR)","Research reported in this publication was supported by National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under award number U01CA193632, by the Department of Graduate Education of the National Science Foundation, NCS award number 1835309.

This is exemplified by the renewal effect, where a change in the background context produces recovery of fear to a conditioned-and-extinguished stimulus. Renewal is the backbone of a widely accepted theory of extinction in animal research, as well as an important experimental model to screen novel treatment techniques. This has led to an explosion of fear renewal research in humans. However, the mere observation of return of fear in a renewal procedure is not sufficient to validate this particular theory of extinction in the tested sample/procedure. Here, we systematically outline a set of experimental tests that aid in evaluating alternative extinction/renewal mechanisms. We examine published renewal studies in human fear conditioning and conclude that the prevailing theory of extinction is often taken for granted, but critical tests are lacking. Including these tests in future research will not only reveal the fear extinction mechanism in humans, but also inspire further developments in extinction treatment research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing white-tailed deer to the vocalizations of humans, extant or locally extirpated non-human predators (coyotes, cougars, dogs, wolves), or non-predator controls (birds), at supplemental food patches to measure the relative impacts on deer feeding behavior. Deer were more than twice as likely to flee upon hearing humans than other predators, and hearing humans was matched only by hearing wolves in reducing overall feeding time gaged by visits to the food patch in the following hour. Combined with previous, site-specific research linking deer fecundity to predator abundance, this study reveals that fear of humans has the potential to induce a larger effect on ungulate reproduction than has ever been reported. By demonstrating that deer most fear the human 'super predator', our results point to the fear humans induce in large ungulates having population- and community-level impacts comparable to those caused by the fear humans induce in large carnivores.","[Crawford, Daniel A.; Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Dept Rangeland & Wildlife Sci, 700 Univ Blvd,MSC 218, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Crawford, Daniel A.; Conner, L.

We explored IDU's accounts of HIV and health risk. Policing practices and how these violate health and self, emerged as a primary theme. Findings show that policing practices violate health and rights directly, but also indirectly, through the reproduction of social suffering. Extrajudicial policing practices produce fear and terror in the day-to-day lives of drug injectors, and ranged from the mundane (arrest without legal justification; the planting of evidence to expedite arrest or detainment; and the extortion of money or drugs for police gain) to the extreme (physical violence as a means of facilitating confession and as an act of moral punishment without legal cause or rationale; the use of methods of torture; and rape). We identify the concept of police bespredel-living with the sense that there are no limits to police power-as a key to perpetuating fear and terror, internalized stigma, and a sense of fatalist risk acceptance. Police besprediel is analyzed as a form of structural violence, contributing to oppression illness. Yet, we also identify cases of resistance to such oppression, characterized by strategies to preserve dignity and hope. We identify hope for change as a resource of risk reduction as well as escape, if only temporarily, from the pervasiveness of social suffering.

In a first experiment, 18 animals were individually confronted with each of the 3 stimuli for 4 min (in a counter-balanced order). The results indicated that both the human and the human-like model elicited greater fear reactions than did the control, and that the former two stimuli did not differ in their fear-eliciting properties. In a second experiment designed to determine if the animals become aware of a difference between the human and the model over time, 32 animals were confronted successively with each of the two stimuli for 8 min. Although there was some habituation towards both stimuli, there was no difference between them even at the end of the test period. These results suggest that a model Could be appropriate in experiments involving human presence (at least for a short duration) and would allow for better standardization.

Background: Past work is limited because it has focused on describing the severity of the weather crisis, not improving the recommendation. Likewise, other research has examined fear appeals that overemphasize death, which leads to poor risk perceptions. Method: In Experiment 1, the presence of fear language and second-person personal pronouns (i.e., you) in a recommendation was manipulated. Experiment 2 examined how fear language and a hurricane changing in intensity influenced risk perceptions across three decision points. Results: Experiment 1 suggested that fear language was more influential than a pronoun on risk perceptions. Experiment 2 suggested that fear language in a protective action recommendation was most impactful in the case of a hurricane decreasing in intensity. Conclusion: Protective action recommendations with fear language influence risk perceptions and behaviors. The magnitude of this influence is dependent on how people have categorized the hurricane (i.e., low vs. high risk). Application: These results demonstrate that fear appeals in hurricane warnings can be useful, especially in cases when a low to medium risk event is still extremely dangerous. Likewise, these results demonstrate a need for caution, as fear appeals are not a one size-fits-all approach to increasing risk perceptions and should be used thoughtfully. Recommendations of when to use fear appeals in protective action recommendations are provided based on the present data.","[Whitmer, Daphne E.] Naval Air Warfare Ctr, Training Syst Div, Orlando, FL 32826 USA; [Sims, Valerie K.] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",,"Whitmer, DE (corresponding author), Naval Air Warfare Ctr, Training Syst Div, Orlando, FL 32826 USA.",daphne.whitmer@gmail.com,,,,,,54,0,0,5,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0018-7208,1547-8181,,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

Extinction does not erase the initial CS-US association, but is thought to form a new memory. After extinction training, extinction memory competes with conditioning memory for control of fear expression. Deficits in fear extinction are thought to contribute to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Herein, we review studies performed in rats showing that the medial prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in the retention and expression of extinction memory. We also review human studies indicating that prefrontal areas homologous to those critical for extinction in rats are structurally and functionally deficient in patients with PTSD. We then discuss how findings from rat studies may allow us to: (1) develop new fear extinction paradigms in humans, (2) make specific predictions as to the location of extinction-related areas in humans, and (3) improve current extinction-based behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders.

In the laboratory, extinction is a preferred method for the study of fear inhibition: however, in this paradigm the same stimulus causes both elicitation (excitation) and inhibition of fear, making it difficult to know whether an experimental manipulation that affects extinction does so by affecting one or both of these processes. For this reason, we sought to develop a behavioral procedure in humans that would render a stimulus primarily inhibitory. Methods: We adapted a conditional discrimination procedure (AX+/BX-), previously validated in animals, to a human fear-potentiated startle paradigm. Forty-one healthy volunteers were presented with one set of colored lights paired with the delivery of aversive airblasts to the throat (AX+) and a different series of light,,; Presented without airblasts (BX-). Results. Participants exhibited fear potentiation to AX+, discrimination between AX+ and BX-, and transfer of fear inhibition to A in an AB compound test but not in an AC compound test.

Recent studies in animal models suggest that the degree to which one is able to control an aversive experience is a critical factor determining its behavioral consequences. In this study, we examined whether stressor controllability modulates subsequent conditioned fear expression in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to an escapable stressor condition, a yoked inescapable stressor condition, or a control condition involving no stress exposure. One week later, all participants underwent fear conditioning, fear extinction, and a test of extinction retrieval the following day. Participants exposed to inescapable stress showed impaired fear extinction learning and increased fear expression the following day. In contrast, escapable stress improved fear extinction and prevented the spontaneous recovery of fear. Consistent with the bidirectional controllability effects previously reported in animal models, these results suggest that one's degree of control over aversive experiences may be an important factor influencing the development of psychological resilience or vulnerability in humans.

The present study aims at examining questions motivated by this finding. We addressed the possibility that unilateral amygdala damage might be sufficient to impair recognition of emotional expressions. We also obtained further data on our subject with bilateral amygdala damage, in order to elucidate possible mechanisms that could account for the impaired recognition of expressions of fear. The results show that bilateral, but not unilateral, damage to the human amygdala impairs the processing of fearful facial expressions. This impairment appears to result from an insensitivity to the intensity of fear expressed by faces. We also confirmed a double dissociation between the recognition of facial expressions of fear, and the recognition of identity of a face: these two processes can be impaired independently, lending support to the idea that they are subserved in part by anatomically separate neural systems. Based on our data, and on what is known about the amygdala's connectivity, we propose that the amygdala is required to link visual representations of facial expressions, on the one hand, with representations that constitute the concept of fear, on the other. Preliminary data suggest the amygdala's role extends to both recognition and recall of fearful facial expressions.","SALK INST BIOL STUDIES,LA JOLLA,CA 92037",,"ADOLPHS, R (corresponding author), UNIV IOWA,COLL MED,DEPT NEUROL,DIV COGNIT NEUROSCI,200 HAWKINS DR,IOWA CITY,IA 52242, USA.",,"Damasio, Antonio/AAD-1342-2019","Tranel, Daniel/0000-0002-1338-1389",NINDS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [NS 19632] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [P01NS019632] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,67,769,781,5,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Fears of spoiling an infant may influence a mother's pattern of responsiveness. Sixty-eight at-risk African American mothers completed questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, empathy, developmental expectations, and beliefs about spoiling. Mothers with greater concerns about the long-term impact of spoiling reported higher levels of depression, more ways in which infants could be spoiled, and inappropriate developmental expectations when compared to mothers with fewer concerns. The pattern of findings suggests ways that fear of spoiling may influence maternal responsiveness in high-risk groups and potentially lead to disturbed mother-infant relationships.","Univ New Orleans, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA; Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",,"Smyke, AT (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Neurol, Tidewater Bldg TB-52,1440 Canal St, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",,,"Alexander, Gerianne/0000-0002-0072-1874",,,,32,8,8,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC-HUMAN SCIENCES PRESS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",0009-398X,,,CHILD PSYCHIAT HUM D,Child Psychiat.

However, in humans the effects of stress on emotional memory are traditionally investigated by declarative memory tests (e.g., recall, recognition) for non-associative emotional stimuli (e.g., stories, pictures). Given that anxiety disorders are thought to originate from associative learning processes and are characterized by distressing emotional responses, the existing literature seems to be inconclusive for the understanding of these disorders. Here, we tested whether noradrenaline strengthens the emotional expression of associative fear memory by using a differential fear conditioning procedure in humans. Stimulation of the noradrenergic system by the administration of yohimbine HCl (20 mg) during memory formation did not directly augment the differential startle fear response 48 h later. Yet, the other retention tests uncovered that the administration of yohimbine HCl contrary to placebo pill extensively delayed the process of extinction learning and generated a superior recovery of fear (i.e., reinstatement and reacquisition). Conversely, the yohimbine HCl manipulation did not affect the skin conductance responding and the US expectancy ratings, emphasizing the concept of multiple memory systems. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration in humans that increased noradrenaline release during or shortly after a stressful event strengthens the formation of associative fear memory traces. The present findings suggest that noradrenaline may play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Humans have supplanted large carnivores as apex predators in many systems, and similarly pervasive impacts may now result from fear of the human 'super predator'. We conducted a landscape-scale playback experiment demonstrating that the sound of humans speaking generates a landscape of fear with pervasive effects across wildlife communities. Large carnivores avoided human voices and moved more cautiously when hearing humans, while medium-sized carnivores became more elusive and reduced foraging. Small mammals evidently benefited, increasing habitat use and foraging. Thus, just the sound of a predator can have landscape-scale effects at multiple trophic levels. Our results indicate that many of the globally observed impacts on wildlife attributed to anthropogenic activity may be explained by fear of humans.","[Suraci, Justin P.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Clinchy, Michael; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Suraci, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",justin.-suraci@gmail.com,,,Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank A.

We conducted a longitudinal study examining the moderating role of attention control in the effects of anger and fear on changes in risk-taking behaviors from early to middle adolescence. MethodThe sample involved participants from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), assessed at 9, 11, and 15years of age. Composite scores for anger, fear, and attention control were computed using indicators from multiple informants, and risk-taking behaviors were assessed based on adolescents' self-reports. ResultsLatent difference score analysis indicated significant moderating effects of attention control showing that increased anger between 9 and 11years was related to increases in risk-taking behaviors between 11 and 15years only for adolescents with low attention control but not for adolescents with high attention control. In contrast, significant moderating effects of attention control for the link between fear and risk-taking behaviors suggested increased fear between 9 and 11years tended to be associated with decreases in risk-taking behaviors between 11 and 15years only for adolescents with high attention control, but not for adolescents with low attention control. ConclusionsAttention control regulates the connections between negative affect such as anger and fear with changes in adolescent risk-taking behaviors. Our data suggest the protective role of strong attention control against the development of risk-taking behaviors in adolescence as it demotes the effects of anger and promotes the effects of fear.","[Kim-Spoon, Jungmeen; Holmes, Christopher; Deater-Deckard, Kirby] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Psychol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Deater-Deckard, Kirby] Virginia Tech, Carilion Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Blacksburg, VA USA",,"Kim-Spoon, J (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Psychol, MC 0436, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",jungmeen@vt.edu,,,National Institute of Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [DA036017]; National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [HD054481]; NICHDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD); EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH &HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R03HD054481] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA036017] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (DA036017) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (HD054481).

Based on psychological theories, a wide definition of fear was adopted, including fear as an emotion, as a perception and as an attitude. Four major categories of interventions were identified: information and education, exposure to animal and habitat, collaboration and participation, and financial incentives. Each of these categories may have a potential to reduce fear responses. The scientific literature on the effect of interventions addressing human fear of large carnivores is scarce and partly contradictory, which makes it difficult for wildlife managers to rely on current research when designing appropriate interventions.

Forty-nine participants were presented with two different contexts (switching on and off the central lighting of the experimental room). In the predictable context, a visual cue (CS I) was systematically followed by an electrocutaneous stimulus (US). In the unpredictable context, CS2 was presented explicitly unpaired with the US. Dependent variables were online US-expectancy ratings and fear-potentiated startle. First, in both measures, the results showed significantly more fear elicited by CS I than by CS2. Second, larger startle amplitudes during the intertrial intervals demonstrated more contextual fear in the unpredictable than in the predictable context. Hence, these findings illustrate that unpredictability increases contextual fear. Moreover, the US-expectancy ratings during the intertrial intervals were also higher in the unpredictable than in the predictable context. This last finding suggests that a chronic expectation of the threatening US is responsible for sustained levels of anxiety in unpredictable situations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The present study examined baseline and fear-potentiated startle eyeblink responses during a stranger-approach paradigm at age 9 months in a group of infants, some of whom displayed high motor activity and negative affect and some of whom displayed high motor activity and positive affect at 4 months. The analyses revealed that the high motor/high negative group of infants exhibited a significantly greater increase in fear-potentiated startle amplitude at 9 months compared with the high motor/high positive group. There were no differences among groups of infants on baseline startle responses. These findings suggest that the origins of behavioral inhibition in early childhood may be linked to a low threshold for arousal in forebrain limbic areas.

While there is considerable agreement about the participation of the amygdala in fear in both animals and humans, there are several issues about the function of the amygdala raised by the human research that have not been addressed by or may be answered by animal research. Three of these are addressed in this article: (1) is the amygdala involved in or necessary for both fear learning and unconditioned fear? (2) Does the amygdala code for intensity of fear? (3) Is the amygdala preferentially involved in fear, or is it also activated when there are no overt fear or aversive stimuli, but where the situation can be described as uncertain? We present evidence indicating that the rodent amygdala is involved in some types of fear (conditioned fear), but not all types (unconditioned fear), and may therefore have significance for a differential neurobiology of certain anxiety disorders in humans. Further, similar to the human amygdala, the rodent amygdala responds to varying intensities of aversive stimulation. Finally, it is suggested that, similar to humans, the rodent amygdala is involved in the evaluation of uncertainty. We conclude that progress on elucidating the role of the amygdala in fear is facilitated by corroboration of findings from both animal and human research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The eyeblink component of the startle reflex, elicited by an abrupt auditory stimulus, was measured in 9 normal volunteers during either the anticipation of electric shocks (anticipatory anxiety) or periods in which no shocks were anticipated (safe period). The eyeblink was consistently higher in amplitude, and shorter in latency, during periods when the subjects anticipated shocks, compared to the safe periods. This effect could not be attributed solely to a reduction in habituation and was statistically significant before the subjects actually received any shock (a single 30 mA stimulation on the median nerve). These results indicate that anticipatory anxiety can be measured objectively in humans using the fear-potentiated startle reflex in a paradigm not actually requiring any shock. Because a great deal is known about the neuroanatomical and pharmacological mechanisms of fear-potentiated startle in laboratory animals, this test procedure may be especially useful in humans to investigate the neurobiological substrates of anxiety disorders and their pharmacological treatments.","YALE UNIV,SCH MED,CONNECTICUT MENT HLTH CARE,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510",,"GRILLON, C (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PSYCHIAT,GERU,40 TEMPLE ST LOWER LEVEL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510, USA.",,/AAF-4811-2020,/0000-0002-3103-5228,NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [5RO1 AA07080] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [1RO1 DA05348] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 25642] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P01MH025642] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA007080] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA005348] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,41,340,342,1,40,SOC PSYCHOPHYSIOL RES,WASHINGTON,"1010 VERMONT AVE NW SUITE 1100, WASHINGTON, DC 20005",0048-5772,,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,SEP,1991,28,5,,,,,588,595,,10.1111/j.1469-8986.1991.tb01999.x,,,8,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,GQ970,WOS:A1991GQ97000011,1758934,,,,2022-04-16,

The responses of vascular resistance (VR) during fear-induced stress was studied by measuring the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), skin blood flow in the index finger and forehead, limb blood flow in the calf and forearm, and blood flow in the renal and superior mesenteric arteries before, during, and after a period of induced fear. After 2 min of rest, baseline data were acquired from eight subjects, after which they watched a 3-min video that was considered to be frightening. Minute-by-minute data were calculated. The MAP was divided by the blood flow to attain the VR. While a clear steady state was not evident in the stress-induced vascular response, stress significantly increased the MAP and HR (e.g., by 10 +/- 3 mm Hg and 8 +/- 3 bpm, respectively, at the 2nd min; mean +/- SEM), and the VR of the forearm and finger skin (e.g., by 80 +/- 26% and 79 +/- 28%, respectively, at the 2nd min). The VR increased slightly in the calf and visceral arteries but not in the forehead throughout the stimulation. The variables returned to baseline levels by the 1st min after cessation of the fearful stimulation. These results suggest that fear-induced stress causes vasoconstriction in the forearm and finger.

However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS-E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS-N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS-) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.","[Sperl, Matthias F.

We aimed to elucidate interactions between subcortical and cortical regions in fear conditioning in humans. To do this, we used two fearful faces as conditioned stimuli (CS) and an electrical stimulation at the left hand, paired with one of the CS, as unconditioned stimulus (US). The luminance of the CS was rhythmically modulated leading to entrainment of brain oscillations at a predefined modulation frequency. Steady-state responses (SSR) were recorded by MEG. In addition to occipital regions, spectral analysis of SSR revealed increased power during fear conditioning particularly for thalamus and cerebellum contralateral to the upcoming US. Using thalamus and amygdala as seed-regions, directed functional connectivity was calculated to capture the modulation of interactions that underlie fear conditioning. Importantly, this analysis showed that the thalamus drives the fusiform area during fear conditioning, while amygdala captures the more general effect of fearful faces perception. This study confirms ideas from the animal literature, and demonstrates for the first time the central role of the thalamus in fear conditioning in humans. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4592-4603, 2015.

Humans distinguish between fear and other emotional chemosignals based on olfactory cues. Here, we study the effect of human fear chemosignals on the speed and accuracy of cognitive performance. In a double-blind experiment, female participants performed a word-association task while smelling one of the three types of olfactory stimuli: fear sweat, neutral sweat, and control odor carrier. We found that the participants exposed to the fear condition performed more accurately and yet with no sacrifice for speed on meaningful word conditions than those under either the neutral or the control condition. At the same time, they performed slower on tasks that contained ambiguous content. Possible factors that could introduce bias, such as individual differences due to anxiety, verbal skills, and perceived qualities of the smells, were ruled out. Our results demonstrate that human fear chemosignals enhance cognitive performances in the recipient. We suggest that this effect originates from learned associations, including greater cautiousness and concomitant changes in cognitive strategies.","Rice Univ, Psychol Dept MS25, Houston, TX 77005 USA",,"Chen, D (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Psychol Dept MS25, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",xdchen@rice.edu,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R03DC004956] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIDCD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R03DC4956] Funding Source: Medline,,,71,85,88,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0379-864X,1464-3553,,CHEM SENSES,Chem.

A reconsolidation update paradigm was developed in which a reconsolidation window is opened by a single isolated retrieval trial of a previously reinforced CS+ which is then followed by Extinction Training within that window. However, follow-up studies in humans using multi-methods fear conditioning indices (e.g., fear-potentiated startle, skin conductance, US-expectancy) have failed to replicate the retrieval + extinction effects. In the present study, we further investigated the retrieval + extinction reconsolidation update paradigm by directly comparing the acquisition, extinction, and return of fear-potentiated startle in the absence or presence of US-expectancy measures (using a trial-by-trial response keypad) with and without retrieval of a previously acquired CS-US association. Participants were fear conditioned to two visual cue CS+'s, one of which was presented as a single, isolated retrieval trial before Extinction Training and one that was extinguished as usual. The results show that the inclusion of US-expectancy measures strengthens the CS-US association to provide enhanced fear conditioning and maintenance of fear memories over the experimental sessions. In addition, in the groups that used on-line US-expectancy measures, the retrieval + extinction procedure reduced reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle to both previously reinforced CS+'s, as compared to the extinction as usual group.

The recall of an extinction memory involves the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to exhibit deficits in this process. Furthermore, extinction forms the basis of exposure therapies commonly used to treat PTSD patients. It is possible that effective pharmacological and/or psychological treatment regimens could influence the activity of these regions, and thereby increase the ability to retain an extinction memory. However, to test this, a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm must demonstrate within-subject reproducibility over time. We, therefore, sought to test the within-subject reliability of a previously used 2-day, classical fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Methods: Eighteen healthy participants participated in a 2-day paradigm on three occasions, each separated by at least 12 weeks. Conditioning and extinction took place on Day 1, and extinction recall and fear renewal were evaluated on Day 2 on each of the three occasions. The conditioned stimulus was a visual cue and the unconditioned stimulus was a mild electric shock to the fingers. Skin conductance was recorded throughout the experiment to measure conditioned responses. Results: We found that conditioning and extinction recall were not significantly different across time and were correlated within subjects. Conclusion: These data illustrate the reliability of this paradigm and its potential usefulness in evaluating the influence of a given treatment on the fear extinction network in longitudinal within-subject designs.","[Milad, Mohammed R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Zeidan, Mohamed A.; Lebron-Milad, Kelimer; Thompson-Hollands, Johanna; Im, Jamie J.

Conditioned stimuli were paired with an aversive electric shock in one visual context and extinguished in a different context. Extinction recall and renewal were examined 24 h after training.

Fifty-five crossbred sows (Landrace x Large White x Duroc) of different parities and stages of pregnancy were each subjected to three tests-Test 0: response of free moving sows to a stationary observer in an open field test; Test S: response of sows in stalls to approaching hand contact; Test G: response of free moving sows in groups to approach by an observer. Each test was repeated after a period of no more than one week and sows behavioural responses were scored according to pre-determined scales of approach-withdrawal behaviour. Although previously validated in another study, Test 0 showed poor repeatability (r(s) = 0.153, P > 0.05), whereas repeatability was good for both Test S (r(s) = 0.777, P < 0.001) and Test G (r(s) = 0.628, P < 0.001). A Kendall coefficient of concordance suggested that there was no overall significant relationship among the three tests (W = 0.507, P > 0.05). Rank correlations showed a weak but significant relationship between Test 0 and Test S (r(s) = 0.270, P < 0.05), a stronger correlation between Test S and Test G (r(s) = 0.404, P < 0.01), but no significant correlation between Test 0 and Test G (r(s) = 0.197, P > 0.05). There were no significant effects of parity or stage of pregnancy on fear responses in any of the three tests. Since they are practical, repeatable and measure the same level of underlying fear of humans in sows, we recommend Test S and Test G for on-farm welfare assessment in different housing systems.

Exaggerated physiological responses may contribute to increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this population, but whether treatment for PTSD can offset CVD risk remains unknown. To further evaluate physiological correlates of fear learning, we used a novel pre-clinical conditioned cardiovascular testing paradigm and examined the effects of Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction training on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) responses. We hypothesized that a fear conditioned cardiovascular response could be detected in a novel context and attenuated by extinction training. In a novel context, fear conditioned mice exhibited marginal increases in MAP (similar to 3 mmHg) and decreases in HR (similar to 20 bpm) during CS presentation. In a home cage context, the CS elicited significant increases in both HR (100 bpm) and MAP (20 mmHg). Following extinction training, the MAP response was suppressed while CS-dependent HR responses were variable. These pre-clinical data suggest that extinction learning attenuates the acute MAP responses to conditioned stimuli over time, and that MAP and HR responses may extinguish at different rates. These results suggest that in mouse models of fear learning, conditioned cardiovascular responses are modified by extinction training. Understanding these processes in pre-clinical disease models and in humans with PTSD may be important for identifying interventions that facilitate fear extinction and attenuate hyper-physiological responses, potentially leading to improvements in the efficacy of exposure therapy and PTSD-CVD comorbidity outcomes.","[Swiercz, Adam P.; Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Swiercz, Adam P.; Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Inst Neurosci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Seligowski, Antonia, V] Harvard Med Sch, McLean Hosp, Belmont, MA USA; [Park, Jeanie] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta VA Med Ctr, Div Renal Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"Marvar, PJ (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC 20052 USA.; Marvar, PJ (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Inst Neurosci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.; Marvar, PJ (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",pmarvar@gwu.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R00 HL107675-03, 1R01HL137103-01A1]; American Heart AssociationAmerican Heart Association [15CSA24340001]; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL137103] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01CX001065] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",PM was supported by NIH R00 HL107675-03 and 1R01HL137103-01A1.

For example, fear has been identified as a predictor of social anxiety problems, but no work has examined whether social and nonsocial fear make independent contributions to risk. We investigated the extent to which early social and nonsocial fear were associated with socially anxious behaviors during kindergarten. To do this, we identified distinct trajectories of social and nonsocial fear across toddlerhood and preschool. Only social fear was associated with socially anxious behaviors at ages 2 and 5. Because the ability to regulate fear contributes to the degree to which fearful children are at risk for anxiety problems, we also tested whether an early developing aspect of self-regulation modulated associations between early fear and kindergarten socially anxious behaviors. Specifically, we tested whether inhibitory control differentially modulated associations between early levels of social and nonsocial fear and socially anxious behaviors during kindergarten. Associations between trajectories of early social fear and age 5 socially anxious behaviors were moderated by individual differences in inhibitory control. Consistent with previous research showing associations between overcontrol and anxiety symptoms, more negative outcomes were observed when stable, high levels of social fear across childhood were coupled with high levels of inhibitory control. Results suggest that the combination of social fear and overcontrol reflect a profile of early risk for the development of social inhibition and social anxiety problems.","[Brooker, Rebecca J.] Montana State Univ, Dept Psychol, POB 173440, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Kiel, Elizabeth J.] Miami Univ, Dept Psychol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Buss, Kristin A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Brooker, RJ (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Psychol, POB 173440, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",rebecca.brooker@montana.edu,"Kiel, Elizabeth/AAV-3272-2020",,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R03 MH67797, R01 MH75750, K01 MH100240]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R15 HD076158]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R15HD076158] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R03MH067797, K01MH100240, R01MH075750] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Data collection for this project was supported by R03 MH67797 and R01 MH75750 from the National Institute of Mental Health (PI: Buss).

We found that participants clearly distinguished between disease-relevant and disease-irrelevant group of animals, and that females always scored higher than males.

Fear demands to be abated, countered or turned into something else, contributing and curtailing how we 'do' being human beings. This special issue of the European Journal of Cultural Studies addresses fear within media and popular culture, adopting a cultural studies approach to fear in a variety of socio-cultural and political contexts. A cultural studies approach allows us to enhance the horizon of understanding cultural practices, mediation and the subjective experience of fear as something we need to work through, in a process of recognition and shock, action and reaction, understanding and reflection. This focus on 'working through fear' offers new insights into the intensely subjective aspects of fear as it is creatively explored in representations within drama and documentary, photography and art, and in user-generated content, memes and political satire, and as it is embodied and experienced by people in the context of their realities. In addition, it shows how fear generates energy, anxiety and even desire. Rather than offering a generalizing account, this issue seeks to address fear in specific contexts, localities and from specific roles and perspectives.","[Hill, Annette] Lund Univ, Media & Commun, Lund, Sweden; [Mortensen, Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hermes, Joke] Inholland Univ, Practice Based Res Media Culture & Citizenship, Diemen, Netherlands",,"Hermes, J (corresponding author), Inholland Univ, NL-1110 AG Diemen, Netherlands.",joke.hermes@inholland.nl,"hermes, joke/Y-3967-2019","hermes, joke/0000-0002-4622-0696",Einar Hansen's Research Foundation through the grant Media and Fear (Lund University); Einar Hansen's Research Foundation through the grant Media and Fear (University of Copenhagen),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Einar Hansen's Research Foundation through the grant Media and Fear (Lund University and University of Copenhagen).",,17,0,0,4,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1367-5494,1460-3551,,EUR J CULT STUD,Eur.

The test is designed to measure the animals' fear of humans, assuming that broilers will withdraw from the observer if they are fearful. However, many broilers close to slaughter age have impaired walking ability, and the results from the touch test may thus be biased by lameness and poor leg health. As the touch test is currently being used in several countries to assess human-animal relationship in broilers, there is an urgent need to examine this potential relationship for a further validation of the test. In the present study, fear of humans was assessed in 50 randomly selected Norwegian broiler flocks, using the touch test as described in the Welfare Quality((R)) protocol for ty broilers. Leg health was assessed by examining the gait of 150 random birds in each of the flocks, using a six-point gait score scale from 0 to 5. The coefficient for the relationship between touch test score and gait score was 0.034 (P<0.001), indicating that the animals express less fear as assessed by the touch test when the gait scores increase. This implies that the touch test may be confounded by impaired walking ability and therefore might be a suboptimal method of assessing fear of humans and human-animal relationship in broilers. In conclusion, the results from this study suggests that the touch test must be further validated in broilers and perhaps be replaced with a fear test that doesn't rely on walking ability.","[Vasdal, G.] Norwegian Meat & Poultry Res Ctr, Lorenveien 38, N-0513 Oslo, Norway; [Moe, R.

Two hundred and thirty-two crossbred gilts and sows were studied and the tests were: HAT, behavioural response of sows individually held in an arena to a stationary experimenter (n = 232); HTA, behavioural response of sows in a group pent an approaching experimenter (n = 232); HTW, behavioural response of sows in a farrowing crate to an approaching experimenter (n = 116). The validated HAT has been used extensively in research to assess fear of humans in pigs and it has been consistently shown that handling treatments designed to differentially affect the pigs' fear of humans produced the expected variations in the approach behaviour of pigs to a stationary experimenter. However, the HAT is impractical for regular on-farm assessment of fear as it involves moving animals individually to an empty pen and is time consuming. There is no evidence in the literature of a well-validated practical test to assess fear of humans in sows in commercial settings and therefore the validity of the HTA and the HTW was investigated by examining their relationship with the HAT. A principal component (PCA) analysis was conducted on each data set for the HAT and HTA to identify a small set of factors for each test that represents the underlying relationships between the variables in each test. For each test a single 'factor' (Factor1HAT and Factor2HT(A)) was identified that provided an appropriate summary of the data. Only three behavioural variables were measured for the HTW, and as such were not suitable for PCA and therefore were treated individually. Spearman rank correlations were used to investigate the relationships between Factor1HAT and both Factor2HT(A) and the HTW variables. The effects of group, parity, time of day, test order in the HAT or HTA, test order in the penand experimenter on Factor1HAT, Factor2HT(A) and the three HTW variables were also studied. A low but significant correlation was found between the HTW and the HAT score (r = 0.24, P = 0.02), while a moderate significant correlation was found between the HAT and HTA scores (r = 0.37, P < 0.01). These relationships suggest that the HTA has reasonable validity; however, further research is required to modify the HTA in order to improve its validity while maintaining its feasibility.

Although ample research has shown that body odours can convey transient emotions like fear, these studies have exclusively treated emotions as categorical, neglecting the question whether emotion quantity can be expressed chemically. Using a unique combination of methods and techniques, we explored a dose-response function: Can experienced fear intensity be encoded in fear sweat? Specifically, fear experience was quantified using multivariate pattern classification (combining physiological data and subjective feelings with partial least-squares-discriminant analysis), whereas a photo-ionization detector quantified volatile molecules in sweat. Thirty-six male participants donated sweat while watching scary film clips and control (calming) film clips. Both traditional univariate and novel multivariate analysis (100% classification accuracy; Q(2): 0.76; R-2: 0.79) underlined effective fear induction. Using their regression-weighted scores, participants were assigned significantly above chance (83% > 33%) to fear intensity categories (low-medium-high). Notably, the high fear group (n = 12) produced higher doses of armpit sweat, and greater doses of fear sweat emitted more volatile molecules (n = 3). This study brings new evidence to show that fear intensity is encoded in sweat (dose-response function), opening a field that examines intensity coding and decoding of other chemically communicable states/traits.

The question is whether the findings of this literature reflect a true effect, and what the average effect size is. These questions were answered by combining traditional meta-analysis with novel meta-analytical tools, p-curve analysis and p-uniform-techniques that could indicate whether findings are likely to reflect a true effect based on the distribution of P-values. A traditional random-effects meta-analysis yielded a small-to-moderate effect size (Hedges' g: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.31-0.41), p-curve analysis showed evidence diagnostic of a true effect (ps < 0.0001), and there was no evidence for publication bias.

Although prior genetic studies of interview-assessed fears and phobias have shown that genetic factors predispose individuals to fears and phobias, they have been restricted to the DSM-III to DSM-IV aggregated subtypes of phobias rather than to individual fearful and phobic stimuli. Method. We examined the lifetime history of fears and/or phobias in response to 21 individual phobic stimuli in 4067 personally interviewed twins from same-sex pairs from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Disorders (VATSPSUD). We performed multivariate statistical analyses using Mx and Mplus. Results. The best-fitting model for the 21 phobic stimuli included four genetic factors (agora-social-acrophobia, animal phobia, blood-injection-illness phobia and claustrophobia) and three environmental factors (agora-social-hospital phobia, animal phobia, and situational phobia). Conclusions. This study provides the first view of the architecture of genetic and environmental risk factors for phobic disorders and their subtypes. The genetic factors of the phobias support the DSM-IV and DSM-5 constructs of animal and blood-injection-injury phobias but do not support the separation of agoraphobia from social phobia. The results also do not show a coherent genetic factor for the DSM-IV and DSM-5 situational phobia. Finally, the patterns of co-morbidity across individual fears and phobias produced by genetic and environmental influences differ appreciably.","[Loken, E. K.; Hettema, J. M.; Aggen, S.

However, current ungulate management ignores the role of nonlethal risk effects of predation. We introduce the concept of hunting for fear' as an extension of the more classical hunting to kill' that is typically used in large herbivore management. Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves. Hunting for fear may offer novel opportunities to help manage the growing humanwildlife conflicts that we experience globally.","[Cromsigt, Joris P. G.

Fear acquisition, extinction and return of fear paradigms serve as experimental learning models for the development, treatment and relapse of anxiety. Individual differences in experimental performance were however mostly regarded as 'noise' by researchers interested in basic associative learning principles. Our work for the first time presents a comprehensive literature overview and methodological discussion on inter-individual differences in fear acquisition, extinction and return of fear. We tell a story from noise that steadily develops into a meaningful tune and converges to a model of mechanisms contributing to individual risk/resilience with respect to fear and anxiety related behavior. Furthermore, in light of the present 'replicability crisis' we identify methodological pitfalls and provide suggestions for study design and analyses tailored to individual difference research in fear conditioning. Ultimately, synergistic transdisciplinary and collaborative efforts hold promise to not only improve our mechanistic understanding but can also be expected to contribute to the development of specifically tailored ('individualized') intervention and targeted prevention programs in the future.","[Lonsdorf, Tina B.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany; [Merz, Christian J.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Bochum, Germany",,"Lonsdorf, TB (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany.",t.lonsdorf@uke.de,"Merz, Christian J/I-7635-2019","Merz, Christian J/0000-0001-5679-6595; Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846","research network 'European interdisciplinary study of fear conditioning, extinction learning and return of fear' (EIFEL-ROF) [DFG LO1980/2-1]; collaborative research center [58]; Research Unit 'Extinction learning: Neural mechanisms, behavioral manifestations, and clinical implications' [FOR 1581]; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG)","This work was supported by the research network 'European interdisciplinary study of fear conditioning, extinction learning and return of fear' (EIFEL-ROF, DFG LO1980/2-1) to TBL and CJM as well as the collaborative research center 58 'Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety disorders' (subprojects B07 and Z02 to TBL) and the Research Unit 'Extinction learning: Neural mechanisms, behavioral manifestations, and clinical implications' (FOR 1581; subproject P5 to CJM), which were all funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

In rats, brief electrical stimulation of the infralimbic cortex has been shown to reduce conditioned freezing during recall of extinction memory. Here, we translated this finding to humans with magnetic resonance imaging-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). METHODS: Subjects (N = 28) were aversively conditioned to two different cues (day 1). During extinction learning (day 2), TMS was paired with one of the conditioned cues but not the other. TMS parameters were similar to those used in rat infralimbic cortex: brief pulse trains (300 ms at 20 Hz) starting 100 ms after cue onset, total of four trains (28 TMS pulses). TMS was applied to one of two targets in the left frontal cortex, one functionally connected (target 1) and the other unconnected (target 2, control) with a human homologue of infralimbic cortex in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Skin conductance responses were used as an index of conditioned fear. RESULTS: During extinction recall (day 3), the cue paired with TMS to target 1 showed significantly reduced skin conductance responses, whereas TMS to target 2 had no effect. Further, we built group-level maps that weighted TMS-induced electric fields and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectivity estimates with fear level. These maps revealed distinct cortical regions and large-scale networks associated with reduced versus increased fear. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that spatiotemporally focused TMS may enhance extinction learning and/or consolidation of extinction memory and suggested novel cortical areas and large-scale networks for targeting in future studies.","[Raij, Tommi; Nummenmaa, Aapo; Setsompop, Kawin] MIT, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA USA; [Raij, Tommi; Nummenmaa, Aapo; Marin, Marie-France; Setsompop, Kawin; Milad, Mohammed R.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Marin, Marie-France; Porter, Daria; Furtak, Sharon; Milad, Mohammed R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Marin, Marie-France] Univ Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Dept Psychiat,Fac Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Furtak, Sharon] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Psychol, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",,"Raij, T (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Ctr Brain Stimulat, Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, 355 East Erie St, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.; Milad, MR (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, 1747 West Roosevelt Rd, Chicago, IL 60608 USA.",tommi.raij@northwestern.edu; milad@uic.edu,"Setsompop, Kawin/P-1464-2014; Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018","Setsompop, Kawin/0000-0003-0455-7634; Raij, Tommi/0000-0001-7439-7491","Department of Defense (DOD)United States Department of Defense [DM 102304]; National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R00EB015445, R00EB012107]; NIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Grant [P41EB015896]; NIH Shared Instrumentation GrantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10RR024694, S10RR023043]; Harvard Catalyst/Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center Grant [NCRR-NIH UL1 RR025758, NCRR-NIH UL1 TR000170]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000170] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [S10RR023401, UL1RR025758, S10RR024694, S10RR023043] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [R00EB015445, P41EB015896, R00EB012107] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the Department of Defense (DOD) Grant No. DM 102304 (to TR, M-FM, DP, SF, and MRM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant Nos.

We posit that during Mid-Paleolithic warfare an encounter with a stranger holding a sharp object was consistently associated with threat to life. A heritable hardwired or firm-wired (prepotentiated) predisposition to abruptly increase vagal tone and collapse flaccidly rather than freeze or attempt to flee or fight in response to an approaching sharp object, a minor injury, or the sight of blood, may have evolved as an alternative stress-induced fear-circuitry response. Such a stable (balanced) polymorphism for the hemodynamically paradoxical flaccid-immobility in response to these stimuli may have increased some non-combatants' chances of survival. This is consistent with the unusual age and sex pattern of fear-induced fainting. The Paleolithic-Threat hypothesis also predicts a link to various hypo-androgenic states (e.g. low dehydroxyepiandrosterone-sulfate. We offer five predictions testable via epidemiological, clinical, and ethological/primatological methods. The Paleolithic-Threat hypothesis has implications for research in the aftermath of man-made disasters, such as terrorism against civilians, a traumatic event in which this hypothesis predicts epidemics of fear-induced fainting.","Pacific Isl Hlth Care Syst, Dept Vet Affairs, Natl Ctr Posttraumat Stree Disorder, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; Univ Hawaii, Dept Psychol, Honolulu, HI USA",,"Bracha, HS (corresponding author), Pacific Isl Hlth Care Syst, Dept Vet Affairs, Natl Ctr Posttraumat Stree Disorder, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.",H.Bracha@med.va.gov,,,,,,20,21,21,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0959-9851,1619-1560,,CLIN AUTON RES,Clin.

Current treatments as well as novel strategies, such as targeting the perisynaptic environment and use of virtual reality, are addressed. We review research on the subjective experience of fear and the role of autobiographical memory in fear-related disorders.

It is, however, unknown whether the BLA acts in similar ways in humans. In a group of five subjects with a rare genetic syndrome, that is, Urbach-Wiethe disease (UWD), we used a combination of structural and functional neuroimaging, and established focal, bilateral BLA damage, while other amygdala sub-regions are functionally intact. We tested the translational hypothesis that these BLA-damaged UWD-subjects are hypervigilant to facial expressions of fear, which are prototypical innate threat cues in humans. Our data indeed repeatedly confirm fear hypervigilance in these UWD subjects. They show hypervigilant responses to unconsciously presented fearful faces in a modified Stroop task. They attend longer to the eyes of dynamically displayed fearful faces in an eye-tracked emotion recognition task, and in that task recognize facial fear significantly better than control subjects. These findings provide the first direct evidence in humans in support of an inhibitory function of the BLA on the brain's threat vigilance system, which has important implications for the understanding of the amygdala's role in the disorders of fear and anxiety.

Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 % more nocturnal and three species become 11.7% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans' avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defamation.","[Mendes, Calebe P.; Carreira, Daiane; Pedrosa, Felipe; Beca, Gabrielle; Lautenschlager, Lais; Akkawi, Paula; Berce, William; Galetti, Mauro] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Lab Biol Conservacao LABIC,UNESP, Ave 24A,1515, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Carreira, Daiane; Ferraz, Katia M.

In animals, it is well documented that the endogenous cannabinoid system has a pivotal role in the successful extinction of fear, most importantly through the cannabinoid receptor 1. However, no human studies have reported a translation of this preclinical evidence yet. Healthy medication-free human subjects (N = 150) underwent a fear conditioning and extinction procedure in a virtual reality environment. Fear potentiation of the eyeblink startle reflex was measured to assess fear-conditioned responding, and subjective fear ratings were collected. Participants were genotyped for two polymorphisms located within the promoter region (rs2180619) and the coding region (rs1049353) of cannabinoid receptor 1. As predicted from the preclinical literature, acquisition and expression of conditioned fear did not differ between genotypes. Crucially, whereas both homozygote (G/G, N = 23) and heterozygote (A/G, N = 68) G-allele carriers of rs2180619 displayed robust extinction of fear, extinction of fear-potentiated startle was absent in A/A homozygotes (N = 51). Additionally, this resistance to extinguish fear left A/A carriers of rs2180619 with significantly higher levels of fear-potentiated startle at the end of the extinction training. No effects of rs1049353 genotype were observed regarding fear acquisition and extinction. These results suggest for the first time involvement of the human endocannabinoid system in fear extinction. Implications are that genetic variability in this system may underlie individual differences in anxiety, rendering cannabinoid receptor 1 a potential target for novel pharmacological treatments of anxiety disorders.

These results indicate that rs2072450 might confer risk for alcohol dependence through deficient fear acquisition indexed by a diminished amygdala response during aversive learning, and provide a neural basis for a weak behavioral inhibition previously documented in individuals at high risk for alcohol dependence.

While many studies have used flight initiation distance as a proxy for fearfulness and examined the factors influencing the decision to flee, there is no general understanding of the relative importance of these factors. By identifying factors with large effect sizes, we can determine whether anti-predator strategies reduce fear, and we gain a unique perspective on the coevolution of predator and anti-predator behaviour. Based on an extensive review and formal meta-analysis, we found that predator traits that were associated with greater risk (speed, size, directness of approach), increased prey distance to refuge and experience with predators consistently amplified the perception of risk (in terms of flight initiation distance). While fish tolerated closer approach when in larger schools, other taxa had greater flight initiation distances when in larger groups. The presence of armoured and cryptic morphologies decreased perception of risk, but body temperature in lizards had no robust effect on flight initiation distance. We find that selection generally acts on prey to be sensitive to predator behaviour, as well as on prey to modify their behaviour and morphology.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Stankowich, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Anim Behav Grad Grp, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",tstankowich@ucdavis.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244",,,,59,644,668,8,362,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Children with a parental history of depression, an indicator of risk, have been found to exhibit an attenuated LPP to emotional stimuli. Research on depressive and anxiety disorders has organized these conditions into two empirical classes: distress and fear disorders. The present study examined whether parental history of distress and fear disorders was associated with the LPP to emotional stimuli in a large sample of adolescent girls. Method The sample of 550 girls (ages 13.5-15.5 years) with no lifetime history of depression completed an emotional picture-viewing task and the LPP was measured in response to neutral, pleasant and unpleasant pictures. Parental lifetime history of psychopathology was determined via a semi-structured diagnostic interview with a biological parent, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to model distress and fear dimensions. Results Parental distress risk was associated with an attenuated LPP to all stimuli. In contrast, parental fear risk was associated with an enhanced LPP to unpleasant pictures but was unrelated to the LPP to neutral and pleasant pictures. Furthermore, these results were independent of the adolescent girls' current depression and anxiety symptoms and pubertal status. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that familial risk for distress and fear disorders may have unique profiles in terms of electrocortical measures of emotional information processing. This study is also one of the first to investigate emotional/motivational processes underlying the distress and fear disorder dimensions.","[Nelson, B. D.; Perlman, G.; Hajcak, G.; Klein, D.

High trait anxiety has been associated with increased risk taking behavior in decision-making tasks. An interesting fact is that anxiety and anxiety-related chemosignals as well as decision-making share similar regions of neuronal activation. In order to ascertain if chemosensory anxiety signals have similar effects on risk taking behavior of healthy participants as high trait anxiety we used a novel computerized decision-making task, called Haegler's Risk Game (HRG). This task measures risk taking behavior based on contingencies and can be played repeatedly without a learning effect. To obtain chemosensory signals the sweat of 21 male donors was collected in a high rope course (anxiety condition). For the chemosensory control condition sweat was collected during an ergometer workout (exercise condition). In a double-blind study, 30 healthy recipients (16 females) had to play HRG while being exposed to sweat samples or empty control samples (control condition) in three sessions of randomized order. Comparison of the risk taking behavior of the three conditions showed significantly higher risk taking behavior in participants for the most risky choices during the anxiety condition compared to the control conditions. Additionally, recipients showed significantly higher latency before making their decision in the most risky choices during the anxiety condition. This experiment gives evidence that chemosensory anxiety signals are communicated between humans thereby increasing participants' risk taking behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Positive generalization was instantiated in cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, striatalthalamic, and midbrain regions (locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey, ventral tegmental area), while negative generalization was implemented in default-mode network nodes (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus) and amygdala. Findings are integrated within an updated neural account of generalization centering on the hippocampus, its modulation by locus coeruleus and basolateral amygdala, and the excitation of threat- or safety-related loci by the hippocampus.","[Webler, Ryan D.; Berg, Hannah; Fhong, Kimberly; Burton, Philip C.; Lissek, Shmuel] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, 75 E River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Tuominen, Lauri] Univ Ottawa, Royals Inst Mental Hlth Res, 1145 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Z 7K4, Canada; [Holt, Daphne J.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Morey, Rajendra A.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Morey, Rajendra A.] VA Med Ctr, VA Midatlantic Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr, Durham VAMC, 508 Fulton St, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Morey, Rajendra A.] Duke Univ, Duke UNC Brain Imaging & Anal Ctr, 40 Duke Med Circle, Durham, NC USA; [Lange, Iris] Maastricht Univ Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Psychol, Sch Mental Hlth & Neurosci, EURON, Duboisdomein 30, NL-6229 GT Maastricht, Netherlands; [Fullana, Miquel Angel] CIBERSAM, Inst Invest Biomed August Pi & Sunyer IDIBAPS, Campus Casanova,Casanova 143, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Fullana, Miquel Angel; Radua, Joaquim] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Adult Psychiat & Psychol Dept, Inst Neurosci, Casanovas 143, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Radua, Joaquim] Kings Coll London, Early Psychosis Intervent & Clin Detect EPIC Lab, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, 16 De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England; [Radua, Joaquim] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Ctr Psychiat Res & Educ, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Lissek, S (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, 75 E River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",smlissek@umn.edu,"Holt, Daphne J/O-2201-2017; Radua, Joaquim/H-6424-2019; Fullana, Miguel/D-3288-2011","Holt, Daphne J/0000-0002-6428-9603; Radua, Joaquim/0000-0003-1240-5438; Fullana, Miguel/0000-0003-3863-5223; Lange, Iris/0000-0002-6251-8978; Berg, Hannah/0000-0002-8283-0133; Webler, Ryan/0000-0002-3861-3393","National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH080130, R01MH095904, RO1NS086885]; Sigrid Juselius Fellowship grant; Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC); Office of Research and Development [5I01CX00074801, 5I01CX000120-02]; Office of Research and Development (Stichting the Weijerhorst)","This work was supported by the National Institute of HealthMH080130 [SL] ; R01MH095904 [DH] ; RO1NS086885 [RM] .

Yet, seldom are parents observed across multiple reproductive bouts, with few studies considering anthropogenic disturbances as an ecological driver of maternal effects. We observed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs over two successive litters to determine whether among-litter differences in behavior (i.e., risk-taking) and hormones (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) corresponded with parental plasticity in habituation. Thus, we explicitly test the hypothesis that accumulating experiences of anthropogenic disturbance reduces parental fear across reproductive bouts, which should have disparate phenotypic consequences for first- and second-litter offspring. To quantify risk-taking behavior, we used foraging assays from 5-15 weeks of age with a human observer present as a proxy for human disturbance. At 5, 10, and 15 weeks of age, we collected shaved hair to quantify pup hormone levels. We then used a quantitative genetic approach to estimate heritability, repeatability, and between-trait correlations. We found that parents were riskier (i.e., foraged more frequently) with their second versus first litters, supporting our prediction that parents become increasingly habituated over time. Second-litter pups were also less risk-averse than their first-litter siblings. Heritability for all traits did not differ from zero (0.001-0.018); however, we found moderate support for repeatability in all observed traits (r = 0.085-0.421). Lastly, we found evidence of positive phenotypic and cohort correlations among pup traits, implying that cohort identity (i.e., common environment) contributes to the development of phenotypic syndromes in coyote pups. Our results suggest that parental habituation may be an ecological cue for offspring to reduce their fear response, thus emphasizing the role of parental plasticity in shaping their pups' behavioral and hormonal responses toward humans.","[Schell, Christopher J.; Santymire, Rachel M.; Mateo, Jill M.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schell, Christopher J.] Univ Washington, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Tacoma, WA USA; [Young, Julie K.] Utah State Univ, USDA WS NWRC, Predator Res Facil, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Lonsdorf, Elizabeth V.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Psychol, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Santymire, Rachel M.] Lincoln Pk Zoo, Conservat & Sci Dept, Chicago, IL USA",,"Schell, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cjschell@uw.edu,"Schell, Christopher/Q-9654-2017","Schell, Christopher/0000-0002-2073-9852; Santymire, Rachel/0000-0003-4102-9144; Lonsdorf, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8057-401X",Pritzker School of Medicine (Hinds Fellowship); Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (NWRC Predator Research Facility Fellowship); United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corporation (MERCK Fellowship); MerckMerck & Company; U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [72184]; University of ChicagoUniversity of Chicago; Directorate for Biological Sciences (NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)),"Pritzker School of Medicine, Grant/Award Number: Hinds Fellowship (2011, 2013); Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Grant/Award Number: NWRC Predator Research Facility Fellowship; United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corporation, Grant/Award Number: MERCK Fellowship; Directorate for Biological Sciences, Grant/Award Number: NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP); Merck; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 72184; University of Chicago",,156,21,21,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In addition to these overt changes to animals' behavior, observers may have more subtle impacts on animals' foraging decisions. However, the anthropogenic alteration of risk-taking behavior has rarely been acknowledged or quantified, particularly in behavioral ecological studies reliant on habituated animals. We tested the magnitude of the human shield effect experimentally on 2 groups of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarcus, at a site with high natural predator density and no human hunting pressure. In general, giving-up densities-the density of food remaining in a patch when a forager leaves-were greatest at ground level (0.1 m) relative to 3 tree canopy levels (2.5, 5, and 7.5 m), highlighting a strong vertical axis of fear. When human followers were present, however, giving-up densities were reduced at all 4 heights; furthermore, for 1 group, the vertical axis disappeared in the presence of observers. Our results suggest that human observers lower monkeys' perceived risk of terrestrial predators and, thereby, affect their foraging decisions at or near ground level. These results have significant implications for future studies of responses to predation risk based on habituation and observational methods.","[Nowak, Katarzyna; Hill, Russell A.] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Evolutionary Anthropol Res Grp, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Nowak, Katarzyna; le Roux, Aliza] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-9866 Qwaqwa, Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa; [Nowak, Katarzyna; Hill, Russell A.] Lajuma Res Ctr, Primate & Predator Project, ZA-0920 Makhado, South Africa; [Richards, Shane A.] Univ Durham, Dept Biol & Biomed Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Scheijen, Ciska P.

It has been studied primarily using fear conditioning in non-human animals, thwarting advances in translational human anxiety research that has used other indices, such as skin conductance responses. Here we examine postural freezing as a human conditioning index for translational anxiety research. We employed a mixed cued/contextual fear-conditioning paradigm where one context signals the occurrence of the US upon the presentation of the CS, and another context signals that the CS is not followed by the US. Critically, during the following generalization phase, the CS is presented in a third and novel context. We show that human freezing is highly sensitive to fear conditioning, generalizes to ambiguous contexts, and amplifies with threat imminence. Intriguingly, stronger parasympathetically driven freezing under threat, but not sympathetically mediated skin conductance, predicts subsequent startle magnitude. These results demonstrate that humans show fear-conditioned animal-like freezing responses, known to aid in active preparation for unexpected attack, and that freezing captures real-life anxiety expression. Conditioned freezing offers a promising new, non-invasive, and continuous, readout for human fear conditioning, paving the way for future translational studies into human fear and anxiety.","[van Ast, Vanessa A.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Ast, Vanessa A.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Ast, Vanessa A.; Klumpers, Floris; Roelofs, Karin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Klumpers, Floris; Roelofs, Karin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Grasman, Raoul P.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to address this question. Body odour samples were collected from 16 two-year-old thoroughbred horses in fear and non-fear situations, respectively. The horse odour samples were then assessed by 73 human odour raters. We found that humans, as a group, were able to correctly assign whether horse odour samples were collected under a fear- or a non-fear condition, respectively. An open question remains, which is whether humans could simply distinguish between little versus much sweat and between high intensity versus low intensity or were able to recognise horses' fear and non-fear emotions. To conclude, the present results indicate that olfaction might contribute to the human recognition of horse emotions. However, these results should be addressed with caution in light of the study's limitations and only viewed as exploratory for future studies. Mammalian body odour conveys cues about an individual's emotional state that can be recognised by conspecifics. Thus far, little attention has been paid to interspecific odour communication of emotions, and no studies have examined whether humans are able to recognise animal emotions from body odour. Thus, the aim of the present study was to address this question. Body odour samples were collected from 16 two-year-old thoroughbred horses in fear and non-fear situations, respectively. The horse odour samples were then assessed by 73 human odour raters. We found that humans, as a group, were able to correctly assign whether horse odour samples were collected under a fear- or a non-fear condition, respectively. Furthermore, they perceived the body odour of horses collected under the fear condition as more intense, compared with the non-fear condition. An open question remains, which is whether humans could simply distinguish between little versus much sweat and between high intensity versus low intensity or were able to recognise horses' fear and non-fear emotions. These results appear to fit the notion that the ability to recognise emotions in other species may present an advantage to both the sender and the receiver of emotional cues, particularly in the interaction between humans and domesticated animals.

On day 1 - the fear acquisition phase, healthy participants are exposed to a series of picture presentations. One picture stimulus (CS1+) is repeatedly paired with an aversive electric stimulus (US), resulting in the acquisition of a fear association, whereas another picture stimulus (CS2-) is never followed by an US. On day 2 - the memory reactivation phase, the participants are re-exposed to the conditioned stimulus without the US (CS1-), which typically triggers a conditioned fear response. After the memory reactivation we administer an oral dose of 40 mg of propranolol HCl, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that indirectly targets the protein synthesis required for reconsolidation by inhibiting the noradrenaline-stimulated CREB phosphorylation. On day 3 - the test phase, the participants are again exposed to the unreinforced conditioned stimuli (CS1- and CS2-) in order to measure the fear-reducing effect of the manipulation. This retention test is followed by an extinction procedure and the presentation of situational triggers to test for the return of fear. Potentiation of the eye blink startle reflex is measured as an index for conditioned fear responding. Declarative knowledge of the fear association is measured through online US expectancy ratings during each CS presentation. In contrast to extinction learning, disrupting reconsolidation targets the original fear memory thereby preventing the return of fear. Although the clinical applications are still in their infancy, disrupting reconsolidation of fear memory seems to be a promising new technique with the prospect to persistently dampen the expression of fear memory in patients suffering from anxiety disorders and other psychiatric disorders.","[Kindt, Merel; Soeter, Marieke; Sevenster, Dieuwke] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Kindt, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",M.Kindt@uva.nl,,,VICI grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research,This work is supported by a VICI grant (Merel Kindt) from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.,,63,17,18,0,17,JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,CAMBRIDGE,"1 ALEWIFE CENTER, STE 200, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02140 USA",1940-087X,,,JOVE-J VIS EXP,J.

However, it is also important to flexibly readjust fear behavior when circumstances change. Indeed, a failure to adjust to changing conditions may contribute to anxiety disorders. A central, yet neglected aspect of fear modulation is the ability to flexibly shift fear responses from one stimulus to another if a once-threatening stimulus becomes safe or a once-safe stimulus becomes threatening. In these situations, the inhibition of fear and the development of fear reactions co-occur but are directed at different targets, requiring accurate responding under continuous stress. To date, research on fear modulation has focused mainly on the shift from fear to safety by using paradigms such as extinction, resulting in a reduction of fear. The aim of the present study was to track the dynamic shifts from fear to safety and from safety to fear when these transitions occur simultaneously. We used functional neuroimaging in conjunction with a fear-conditioning reversal paradigm. Our results reveal a unique dissociation within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex between a safe stimulus that previously predicted danger and a naive safe stimulus. We show that amygdala and striatal responses tracked the fear-predictive stimuli, flexibly flipping their responses from one predictive stimulus to another. Moreover, prediction errors associated with reversal learning correlated with striatal activation. These results elucidate how fear is readjusted to appropriately track environmental changes, and the brain mechanisms underlying the flexible control of fear.","[Schiller, Daniela; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Schiller, Daniela; Levy, Ifat; LeDoux, Joseph E.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Niv, Yael] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Niv, Yael] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Phelps, EA (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl,Room 863, New York, NY 10003 USA.",liz.phelps@nyu.edu,"Schiller, Daniela/Q-2431-2018","Schiller, Daniela/0000-0002-0357-7724; Levy, Ifat/0000-0001-7851-9070","Seaver Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 K05 MH067048, P50 MH58911, R21 MH072279]; James S.

It has been proposed that memory labilization allows for the integration of relevant information in the established memory trace (memory updating). Memory labilization and reconsolidation do not necessarily occur when a memory is being reactivated, but only when there is something to be learned during memory retrieval (prediction error). Thus, updating of a fear memory trace should not occur under retrieval conditions in which the outcome is fully predictable (no prediction error). Here, we addressed this issue, using a human differential fear conditioning procedure, by eliminating the very possibility of reinforcement of the reminder cue. A previously established fear memory (picture-shock pairings) was reactivated with shock-electrodes attached (Propranolol group, n = 18) or unattached (Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group, n = 19). We additionally tested a placebo-control group with the shock-electrodes attached (Placebo group, n = 18). Reconsolidation was not triggered when nothing could be learned during the reminder trial, as noradrenergic blockade did not affect expression of the fear memory 24 h later in the Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group. Only when the outcome of the retrieval cue was not fully predictable, propranolol, contrary to placebo, reduced the startle fear response and prevented the return of fear (reinstatement) the following day. In line with previous studies, skin conductance response and shock expectancies were not affected by propranolol. Remarkably, a double dissociation emerged between the emotional (startle response) and more cognitive expression (expectancies, SCR) of the fear memory. Our findings have important implications for reconsolidation blockade as treatment strategy for emotional disorders. First, fear reducing procedures that target the emotional component of fear memory do not necessarily affect the cognitive component and vice versa. Second, mere retrieval of the fear memory is not sufficient to induce its labilization and reconsolidation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, it has yet to be experimentally tested if large carnivores perceive humans as predators and react strongly enough to have cascading effects on their prey. We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing pumas to predator (human) and non-predator control (frog) sounds at puma feeding sites to measure immediate fear responses to humans and the subsequent impacts on feeding. We found that pumas fled more frequently, took longer to return, and reduced their overall feeding time by more than half in response to hearing the human 'super predator'. Combined with our previous work showing higher kill rates of deer in more urbanized landscapes, this study reveals that fear is the mechanism driving an ecological cascade from humans to increased puma predation on deer. By demonstrating that the fear of humans can cause a strong reduction in feeding by pumas, our results support that non-consumptive forms of human disturbance may alter the ecological role of large carnivores.","[Smith, Justine A.; Suraci, Justin P.; Crawford, Ayana; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.; Clinchy, Michael; Roberts, Devin; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Smith, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jsmith5@ucsc.edu,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation grant #1255913, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",,30,87,89,12,118,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

PTSD is a fear-based disorder, characterized by difficulties in extinguishing the learned fear response and maintaining extinction. Currently, the first-line treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy, which forms an extinction memory to compete with the original fear memory. However, the extinguished fear often returns under numerous circumstances, suggesting that novel methods are needed to eliminate fear memory or facilitate extinction memory. This review discusses research that targeted extinction and reconsolidation to manipulate fear memory. Recent studies indicate that sleep is an active state that can regulate memory processes. We also discuss the influence of sleep on fear memory. For each manipulation, we briefly summarize the neural mechanisms that have been identified in human studies. Finally, we highlight potential limitations and future directions in the field to better translate existing interventions to clinical settings.","[Yue, Jingli; Shi, Le; Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Hosp 6, Inst Mental Hlth,Key Mental Hlth,Minist Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Shi, Le; Khan, Muhammad Zahid; Shi, Jie; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",,"Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Hosp 6, Inst Mental Hlth,Key Mental Hlth,Minist Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,,,National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2015BAI13B01],This work was supported by the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2015BAI13B01).,,86,2,4,3,19,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7305,1869-1889,,SCI CHINA LIFE SCI,Sci.

Overgeneralization, however, is maladaptive and has been implicated in a number of anxiety disorders. Neuroimaging research has indicated several regions sensitive to effects of gener-alization, including regions involved in fear excitation (e.g., amygdala, insula) and inhibition (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Research has suggested several other small brain regions may play an important role in this process (e.g., hippocampal subfields, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [BNST], habenula), but, to date, these regions have not been examined during fear generalization due to limited spatial resolution of standard human neuroimaging. To this end, we utilized the high spatial resolution of 7T fMRI to characterize the neural circuits involved in threat discrimination and generalization. Additionally, we examined potential modulating effects of trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty on neural activation during threat generalization. In a sample of 31 healthy undergraduate students, significant positive generalization effects (i.e., greater activation for stim-uli with increasing perceptual similarity to a learned threat cue) were observed in the visual cortex, thalamus, habenula and BNST, while negative generalization effects were observed in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3. Associations with individual differences were underpowered, though preliminary findings suggested greater gen-eralization in the insula and primary somatosensory cortex may be correlated with self-reported anxiety. Overall, findings largely support previous neuroimaging work on fear generalization and provide additional insight into the contributions of several previously unexplored brain regions.","[Huggins, Ashley A.; Weis, Carissa N.; Parisi, Elizabeth A.; Larson, Christine L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 2441 E Hartford Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Bennett, Kenneth P.] Montana VA Healthcare Syst, Helena, MT USA; [Miskovic, Vladimir] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Psychol, Binghamton, NY USA; [Huggins, Ashley A.] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Psychiat, Charleston, SC 29425 USA",,"Larson, CL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 2441 E Hartford Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",huggins@uwm.edu; cnweis@uwm.edu; eaparisi@uwm.edu; benne257@uwm.edu; larsoncl@uwm.edu,,,,,,151,1,1,12,16,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1053-8119,1095-9572,,NEUROIMAGE,Neuroimage,OCT 1,2021,239,,,,,,,,118308,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118308,,JUL 2021,16,"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",TU8NS,WOS:000681288300001,34175426,gold,,,2022-04-16,

Objective: The four studies presented in this report sought to further validate the threat of shock paradigm as a human analogue to fear-potentiated startle in rats, by examining the effect of benzodiazepine administration on both baseline and fear-potentiated startle. Methods: Three studies, conducted at Utrecht University, evaluated the effects of oxazepam and of diazepam on baseline and fear-potentiated startle, whereas a fourth study, conducted at Yale University, evaluated the effect of diazepam on baseline, contextual and cuespecific fear-potentiated startle. The threat of shock paradigm consisted of verbal instruction about two visual cues (the threat cue predicted the possible administration of electric shock, the other predicted a safe period), followed by a series of presentations of these cues. During these conditions, acoustic startle stimuli were presented in order to elicit startle responses. The magnitude of the startle response was used to index the degree of fear or alarm experienced during the periods of threat and safety. The fourth study examined the effect of IV administration of diazepam in a similar threat of shock paradigm except that there were two additional context manipulations: electrode placement and darkness. Results: None of the drug manipulations affected specific threat-cue potentiation of startle. However, reductions in baseline startle were observed. Further, startle potentiation by darkness was inhibited by diazepam. Conclusions: At least one type of fear-potentiated startle, i.e. potentiation by a cue-specific fear manipulation, is not susceptible to benzodiazepine treatment. In contrast, effects of manipulations more akin to anxiety (darkness, context) appear sensitive to benzodiazepines. Human experimental models differentiating between these cue specific and contextual responses are needed to shed more light on differences in the anatomy and pharmacology of anxiety disorders.","Univ Utrecht, Fac Pharm, Dept Psychopharmacol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Connecticut VA Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, West Haven, CT 06516 USA",,"Baas, JMP (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, 15K N Dr MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",,,"Baas, Johanna/0000-0001-6267-8712","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798, Z01MH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,46,97,97,0,13,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,MAY,2002,161,3,,,,,233,247,,10.1007/s00213-002-1011-8,,,15,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,562JG,WOS:000176193200003,12021826,,,,2022-04-16,

Human activities can indirectly shape this landscape of fear by altering behavior and spatial distribution of carnivores. We studied how red deer perceive the landscape of fear in an old-growth forest system (Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland) both at large and fine spatial scale. Camera traps were placed at locations with and without tree logs (fine-scale risk factor) and at different distances from the core of a wolf territory and human settlements (large-scale risk factor). Red deer avoided coming close to large tree logs and increased their vigilance levels when they were present in close vicinity. The strength of these effects depended on the distance to the wolf core area; deer perceived tree logs as more risky when wolves were more often present. Hence, tree logs inside wolf core areas create fine-scale patches of fear with reduced deer browsing pressure, thereby enhancing chances for successful tree recruitment. Human presence shapes this landscape of fear as wolf core areas are located far from human settlements. This human shadow on predator-prey interactions is therefore an important component that should be taken into account in human-dominated landscapes.","[Kuijper, Dries P.

Hare, 1963; Watts and Sharrock, 1984). The goals of the present study were twofold: to replicate the effect of a fear cue on time estimation, and to evaluate the mechanism underlying the effect. Seven stimulus durations in two different duration ranges (short: 250-1000 ms; long: 400-1600 ms) were employed in the bisection procedure. Adult human participants were exposed to two successive sessions, one each with the short and long range. Images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2008) that were rated on three scales including arousal and fear were presented as temporal stimuli. Three images that were rated high on fear and three rated low served as fear cues and neutral control images, respectively. Results indicated that for both ranges, judgments were longer for fear cues than for neutral images, and that the magnitude of the effect did not differ between ranges as measured by the bisection point. Application of scalar expectancy theory (SET; Gibbon. 1977; Church, 1984) to these results suggests that the fear effects were mediated by switch latency of an internal clock, rather than by clock speed.

The present study examined the effects of experimentally induced fear and anxiety on radiant heat pain thresholds. Sixty male and female human subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 emotion induction conditions: (1) fear, induced by exposure to three brief shocks; (2) anxiety, elicited by the threat of shock; (3) neutral, with no intervention. Pain thresholds were tested before and after emotion induction. Results suggest that findings from animal studies extend to humans: fear resulted in decreased pain reactivity, while anxiety led to increased reactivity. Pain rating data indicated that participants used consistent subjective criteria to indicate pain thresholds. Both subjective and physiological indicators (skin conductance level, heart rate) confirmed that the treatment conditions produced the targeted emotional states. These results support the view that emotional states modulate human pain reactivity. (C) 2000 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Prior studies have found that reducing fear generalization using a generalization stimulus (GS) is ineffective in removing a conditioned fear that incorporates local features, and that topological properties appear to play a comparatively more significant role in the processes of perception and categorization. Our study utilized a conditioned-fear generalization design to examine whether the topological properties of stimuli influence the generalization and return of fear. Fear was indexed using online expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses (SCRs). The study's 52 participants were divided into three groups: Group 1, conditioned danger cue (CS+) extinction; Group 2, extinction of one GS; Group 3, extinction of three GSs. We found that the three groups acquired conditioned fear at the same level. In the generalization and extinction phase, fear was transferred to the GS with the same topological properties as CS+, and gradual decreases in both shock expectancy and SCRs over non-reinforced extinction trials were observed. In the test phase, participants' online expectancy ratings indicated that fear did not return in Group 1, but did return in Groups 2 and 3. All three groups demonstrated successful GS fear extinction, but only Group 1 did not show a return of fear for CS+. Regarding SCRs results, none of the groups demonstrated a return of fear, suggesting that utilization of topological properties successfully reduced the return of conditioned fear. Our results indicate that, in clinical settings, using GS with topological equivalence to CS+ might offer a potential method with which to extinct conditioned fear.","[Xu, Liang; Su, Hongyu; Xie, Xiaoyuan; Yan, Pei; Li, Junjiao; Zheng, Xifu] South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang] Guangdong Commun Polytech, Dept Human & Social Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Su, Hongyu; Xie, Xiaoyuan; Yan, Pei; Li, Junjiao; Zheng, Xifu] South China Normal Univ, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Su, Hongyu; Xie, Xiaoyuan; Yan, Pei; Li, Junjiao; Zheng, Xifu] South China Normal Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Mental Hlth & Cognit Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Zheng, XF (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Zheng, XF (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Zheng, XF (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Mental Hlth & Cognit Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xifu.zheng.xz@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31771218]; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDB259]; Guangzhou government,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771218), the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (14ZDB259), and psychological services and counseling base for the Happy Guangzhou project, which received funding from the Guangzhou government.",,53,2,3,3,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

This article evaluated the potential effect of exposure to bears and their habitats on human fear of brown bears using the modeling of appropriate behavior when close to bears. In a within-subject design, 25 persons who reported to be fearful of brown bears participated in a guided walk approaching approximately 50 m of a brown bear in its daybed and in a guided forest walk in bear habitat. The presentation order was reversed for half of the group. The participants reported significantly reduced feelings of fear after the bear walk, but not after the forest walk. There were no corresponding significant effects for the experimental measures of fear-related responses. The results partially support the notion that exposure to the object of fear, such as a bear habitat with presence of a bear, might be a feasible intervention to reduce peoples' feeling of fear, but the design of the intervention must be developed further before it can be used in practice.","[Johansson, Maria] Lund Univ, Environm Psychol, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Stoen, Ole-Gunnar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resources Management, As, Norway; [Flykt, Anders] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Psychol, Ostersund, Sweden",,"Johansson, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Environm Psychol, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",maria.johansson@mpe.lth.se,"Sten, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020",,Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway,"This research was funded by research grants from the Norwegian Environment Agency.

It has been suggested that an opioidergic signal, which is engaged through conditioning and acts inhibitory on unconditioned stimulus input, is the source of these effects. To clarify whether blockade of endogenous opioid neurotransmission enhances acquisition of conditioned fear in humans, and to elucidate the neural underpinnings of such an effect, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with behavioral recordings and a double-blind pharmacological intervention. All subjects underwent the same classical fear-conditioning paradigm, but subjects in the experimental group received the opioid antagonist naloxone before and during the experiment, in contrast to subjects in the control group, who received saline. Blocking endogenous opioid neurotransmission with naloxone led to more sustained responses to the unconditioned stimulus across trials, evident in both behavioral and blood oxygen level-dependent responses in pain responsive cortical regions. This effect was likely caused by naloxone blocking conditioned responses in a pain-inhibitory circuit involving opioid-rich areas such as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Most importantly, naloxone enhanced the acquisition of fear on the behavioral level and changed the activation profile of the amygdala: whereas the control group showed rapidly decaying conditioned responses across trials, the naloxone group showed sustained conditioned responses in the amygdala. Together, these results demonstrate that in humans the endogenous opioid system has an inhibitory role in the acquisition of fear.","[Eippert, Falk; Schoell, Eszter; Yacubian, Juliana; Buechel, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Bingel, Ulrike] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany",,"Eippert, F (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",f.eippert@uke.uni-hamburg.de,"Eippert, Falk/M-6188-2013","Schoell, Eszter D./0000-0001-9817-521X; Eippert, Falk/0000-0002-3986-1719",,,,62,67,67,1,5,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,1529-2401,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Healthy young adults stood at four different Surface heights (ground, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 m) under three different visual conditions (eyes open, eyes closed and eyes open with peripheral vision occluded). Mean position, Mean Power Frequency (MPF) and Root Mean Square (RMS) of centre of pressure (COP) displacements were calculated from 60 s standing trials, and psychosocial and physiological measures of fear and anxiety were also collected. When standing at a height of 3.2 m, 10 of 36 participants reported an increase in anxiety and a robust fear response while the remaining 26 participants experienced only an increase in anxiety and no fear response. A between subjects analysis of the effect Of Surface height on postural control revealed that fearful and non-fearful participants adopted different postural control strategies with increased heights. Non-fearful participants demonstrated a postural response characterized by increased MPF and decreased RMS of COP displacements with increasing heights. In contrast, fearful participants demonstrated both increasing MPF and RMS of COP displacements with increasing heights. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, a direct relationship between fear of falling and the strategies used for human postural control. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A functional, anatomical model of defense behavior in animals is presented and applications are described in cognitive and physiological studies of human affect. It is proposed that unpleasant emotions depend on the activation of an evolutionarily primitive subcortical circuit, including the amygdala and the neural structures to which it projects. This motivational system mediates specific autonomic (e.g., heart rate change) and somatic reflexes (e.g., startle change) that originally promoted survival in dangerous conditions. These same response patterns are illustrated in humans, as they process objective, memorial, and media stimuli. Furthermore, it is shown how variations in the neural circuit and its outputs may separately characterize cue-specific fear las in specific phobia) and more generalized anxiety. Finally, again emphasizing links between the animal and human data, we focus on special, attentional features of emotional processing: The automaticity of fear reactions, hyper-reactivity to minimal threat-cues, and evidence that the physiological responses in fear may be independent of slower, language-based appraisal processes.

Session 1 intertrial interval startles-a measure of contextual conditioning-were greater in the unpaired compared to the paired group. Context conditioning was retained in Session 2 and was present before the shock electrodes were attached. Self-rating of state anxiety, arousal, and pleasure indicated differential changes in mood from Session 1 to Session 2 in the two groups, with the unpaired group showing relatively greater negative affects compared to the paired group.

We present the results of a comprehensive meta-analysis investigating fear appeals' effectiveness for influencing attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. We tested predictions from a large number of theories, the majority of which have never been tested meta-analytically until now. Studies were included if they contained a treatment group exposed to a fear appeal, a valid comparison group, a manipulation of depicted fear, a measure of attitudes, intentions, or behaviors concerning the targeted risk or recommended solution, and adequate statistics to calculate effect sizes. The meta-analysis included 127 articles (9% unpublished) yielding 248 independent samples (N-Total = 27,372) collected from diverse populations. Results showed a positive effect of fear appeals on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, with the average effect on a composite index being random-effects (d) over bar = 0.29. Moderation analyses based on prominent fear appeal theories showed that the effectiveness of fear appeals increased when the message included efficacy statements, depicted high susceptibility and severity, recommended one-time only (vs. repeated) behaviors, and targeted audiences that included a larger percentage of female message recipients. Overall, we conclude that (a) fear appeals are effective at positively influencing attitude, intentions, and behaviors; (b) there are very few circumstances under which they are not effective; and (c) there are no identified circumstances under which they backfire and lead to undesirable outcomes.","[Tannenbaum, Melanie B.; Wilson, Kristina; Albarracin, Dolores] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hepler, Justin] Univ Nevada, Dept Psychol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Zimmerman, Rick S.] Univ Missouri, Coll Nursing, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Saul, Lindsey; Jacobs, Samantha] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Social & Behav Hlth, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",,"Albarracin, D (corresponding author), 603 E Daniel St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",dalbarra@illinois.edu,,, [R01 MH094241];  [R01 NR08325];  [R56 AI114501]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R56AI114501] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH094241] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [R01NR008325] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This article was facilitated by Grants R01 MH094241, R01 NR08325, and R56 AI114501.",,193,410,410,20,241,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0033-2909,1939-1455,,PSYCHOL BULL,Psychol.

This may help to explain that the ability of detecting a danger or threat has been highly conserved throughout evolution, and, thus involves a high degree of homologies across species. Studies in laboratory animals thereby enable to identify key neurochemical, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fear and anxiety, and importantly, to also draw conclusions on the mechanistics in human beings. This, in turn, provides a most valuable basis of fostering improvements in prognosis, diagnosis, prevention and therapies of anxiety disorders. The present article focuses on one aspect that is central to translational anxiety research, namely the neuronal substrates and circuits of fear memory and fear extinction. Following a brief introduction to the principles of fear conditioning, synaptic circuits will be described underlying the acquisition and extinction of fear memory in the mammalian brain. Historically established principles will be systematically compared with novel findings on the detailed synaptic circuit organization of the fear matrix. The knowledge of the neuronal substrates and connectivities will significantly improve our understanding of pathologically transformed states of fear and anxiety, and thereby help to derive novel intervention strategies for the treatment of anxiety disorders.","[Wotjak, Carsten T.] LMU Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Pape, Hans-Christian] Otto von Guericke Univ, Inst Physiol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Pape, Hans-Christian] Westfal Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Physiol Neurophysiol 1, Munster, Germany",,"Wotjak, CT (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Psychiat AG Neuronale Plastizitat, Kraepelinstr 2-10, D-80804 Munich, Germany.",wotjak@mpipsykl.mpg.de; hans-christian.pape@ukmuenster.de,"Wotjak, Carsten T./S-3200-2019",,,,,13,6,6,3,26,SPEKTRUM AKADEMISCHER VERLAG-SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH,HEILDEBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, HEILDEBERG, 69121, GERMANY",0947-0875,,,NEUROFORUM,Neuroforum,SEP,2013,19,3,,,,,92,102,,,,,11,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,211AY,WOS:000323877700002,,,,,2022-04-16,

In this paradigm, the amygdala is known to play a critical role. However, classical fear conditioning requires first-hand experience with an aversive event, which may not be how most fears are acquired in humans. It remains to be determined whether the conditioning model can be extended to indirect forms of learning more common in humans. Here we show that fear acquired indirectly through social observation, with no personal experience of the aversive event, engages similar neural mechanisms as fear conditioning. The amygdala was recruited both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in an analogous situation. These findings confirm the central role of the amygdala in the acquisition and expression of observational fear learning, and validate the extension of cross-species models of fear conditioning to learning in a human sociocultural context. Our findings also provides new insights into the relationship between learning from, and empathizing with, fearful others. This study suggests that indirectly attained fears may be as powerful as fears originating from direct experiences.","[Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nearing, Katherine I.] NYU, Sch Med, Epilepsy Ctr, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Olsson, Andreas] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Phelps, EA (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl Meyer Hall, New York, NY 10003 USA.",liz.phelps@nyu.edu,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH062104, MH62104] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,41,185,188,4,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1749-5016,,,SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR,Soc.

Electrophysiological rodent studies further indicate that oscillatory neuronal activity in homolog regions (i.e., prelimbic and infralimbic cortices) changes during fear expression and fear extinction recall. Whether similar processes occur in humans remains largely unexplored. By assessing scalp surface EEG in conjunction with LORETA source estimation of CS-related theta and gamma activity, we tested whether a priori defined ROIs in the human AMC and vmPFC similarly modulate their oscillatory activity during fear expression and extinction recall, respectively. To this end, 42 healthy individuals underwent a differential conditioning/differential extinction protocol with a Recall Test on the next day. In the Recall Test, nonextinguished versus extinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential (CS+ vs CS-) response with regard to skin conductance and AMC-localized theta power. Conversely, extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential response with regard to vmPFC-localized gamma power. Finally, individuals who failed to show a suppressed skin conductance response to the extinguished versus nonextinguished CS+ also failed to show the otherwise observed alterations in vmPFC gamma power to extinguished CS+. These results indicate that fear expression is associated with AMC theta activity, whereas successful fear extinction recall relates to changes in vmPFC gamma activity. The present work thereby bridges findings from prior rodent electrophysiological research and human neuroimaging studies and indicates that EEG is a valuable tool for future fear extinction research.","[Mueller, Erik M.; Panitz, Christian; Hermann, Christiane] Univ Giessen, Dept Clin Psychol, D-39354 Giessen, Germany; [Mueller, Erik M.; Pizzagalli, Diego A.] Harvard Univ, McLean Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Depress Anxiety & Stress Res, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Mueller, Erik M.; Pizzagalli, Diego A.] Harvard Univ, McLean Hosp, Sch Med, McLean Imaging Ctr, Belmont, MA 02478 USA",,"Mueller, EM (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Clin Psychol, Otto Behaghel Str 10F, D-39354 Giessen, Germany.",erik.mueller@psychol.uni-giessen.de,"Mueller, Erik Malte/N-5710-2014; Pizzagalli, Diego A./Z-1595-2019; Panitz, Christian/AAJ-3506-2020; Mueller, Erik/ABE-1757-2021","Mueller, Erik Malte/0000-0002-8721-8963; Panitz, Christian/0000-0001-6692-8555; Mueller, Erik/0000-0002-8721-8963",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG MU3535/2-1]; Gustav A.

However, whether or not such instructions were provided to participants often remains unsaid in fear conditioning studies. In the current study (N = 102), we investigated whether conditioned fear acquisition depends on CS-US contingency instructions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first group was instructed about the precise CS-US contingency before conditioning. The second group was instructed to discover the CS-US contingency. The third group did not receive any contingency instructions. We found facilitated fear acquisition (using skin conductance and startle) and increased contingency awareness in the first and second group compared to the third group. Furthermore, contingency reversal instructions immediately reversed conditioned responses. Based on these results, we advise to systematically report the contingency instructions used in fear conditioning research.","[Mertens, Gaetan] Tilburg Univ, Dept Med & Clin Psychol, Warandelaan 2,Room T526, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands; [Mertens, Gaetan; Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis; Engelhard, Iris M.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Boddez, Yannick] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Res Grp Hlth Psychol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Mertens, G (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Dept Med & Clin Psychol, Warandelaan 2,Room T526, NL-5037 AB Tilburg, Netherlands.",g.mertens@tilburguniversity.edu,"Mertens, Gatan/ABC-3386-2021; Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis/ABD-1739-2020","Mertens, Gatan/0000-0003-1923-6657; Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis/0000-0001-9704-6520",NWO VICI grantNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [453-15-005]; Ghent UniversityGhent University [BOF16/MET_V/002],"GM, AMK, and IME are supported by a NWO VICI grant (grant number: 453-15-005) awarded to IME.

As extinction represents a context-dependent form of new learning, one possible strategy to circumvent the return of fear is to conduct extinction across several environments. Here, we tested the effectiveness of multiple context extinction in a two-day fear conditioning experiment using 3-D virtual reality technology to create immersive, ecologically-valid context changes. Fear-potentiated startle served as the dependent measure. All three experimental groups initially acquired fear in a single context. A multiple extinction group then underwent extinction in three contexts, while a second group underwent extinction in the acquisition context and a third group underwent extinction in a single different context. All groups returned 24 h later to test for return of fear in the extinction context (spontaneous recovery) and a novel context (renewal and reinstatement/test). Extinction in multiple contexts attenuated reinstatement of fear but did not reduce spontaneous recovery. Results from fear renewal were tendential. Our findings suggest that multi-context extinction can reduce fear relapse following an aversive event - an event that often induces return of fear in real-world settings - and provides empirical support for conducting exposure-based clinical treatments across a variety of environments.

Some theories invoke a transfer of responses from unconditioned stimuli (US) to conditioned stimuli (CS), but this principle goes astray because responses to the US and CS can differ substantially. The idea that we introduce here is that the pattern of responses to a newly established CS does not come from the US but (at least partly) transfers from how one (learned to) respond(s) to previously encountered stimuli with threat value. So, we conceptualize threat value as a stimulus feature that allows responses to transfer between stimuli that share this feature (in the same way as, for example, overlap in color or shape can support transfer). In contrast to prevailing views, this new perspective focuses on the relation between the CS and already established threat signals rather than on the relation between the CS and the US. We discuss how this shared features perspective on human fear responding can inspire future directions in both the laboratory and clinical practice.","[Boddez, Yannick; Finn, Martin; De Houwer, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Boddez, Y (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium.; Boddez, Y (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium.",Yannick.Boddez@UGent.be,"De Houwer, Jan/ABF-6866-2021","De Houwer, Jan/0000-0003-0488-5224",Ghent UniversityGhent University [BOF16/MET_V/002],This work was funded by Ghent University grant BOF16/MET_V/002 awarded to Jan De Houwer.,,45,1,1,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-250X,2352-2518,,CURR OPIN PSYCHOL,Curr.

Yet energetic constraints on movement imposed by the physical landscape have only been considered separately from those imposed by risk avoidance, limiting our understanding of how short-term movement decisions scale up to affect long-term space use. Here, we integrate the costs of both physical terrain and predation risk into a common currency, energy, and then quantify their effects on the short-term movement and long-term spatial ecology of a large carnivore living in a human-dominated landscape. Using high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data from collared pumas (Puma concolor), we calculated the short-term (i.e., 5-min) energetic costs of navigating both rugged physical terrain and a landscape of risk from humans (major sources of both mortality and fear for our study population). Both the physical and risk landscapes affected puma short-term movement costs, with risk having a relatively greater impact by inducing high-energy but low-efficiency movement behavior. The cumulative effects of short-term movement costs led to reductions of 29% to 68% in daily travel distances and total home range area. For male pumas, long-term patterns of space use were predominantly driven by the energetic costs of human-induced risk. This work demonstrates that, along with physical terrain, predation risk plays a primary role in shaping an animal's energy landscape and suggests that fear of humans may be a major factor affecting wildlife movements worldwide.","[Nickel, Barry A.; Suraci, Justin P.; Nisi, Anna C.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Nickel, BA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",bnickel@ucsc.edu,,"Nisi, Anna/0000-0003-0286-3187","Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913, 0963022]","We thank P.

Disease and death are beeing increasingly ruled out from the pattern of everyday life. Therefore, disease and death represent an extreme emotional stress for today's human beings, who find it difficult to assess their significance. Against this background we must view human fear and anxiety before surgery. Nowadays, people have lost the ability of dealing with themselves and their own problems. There is no place for disease in a world dominated by materialism. Accordingly, it is an extreme challenge for any human remain psychologically stable, whereas, anxiety appears increasingly irrational. Both anaesthesiologists and surgeons are responsible for removing anxiety and affording assistance to patients expecting surgery. Consequently, contemporary strategies of therapy include both surgical and psychosocial aspects. Therefore, confidence concerning the relationship between surgeon and patient, consideration of psychosocial factors, and an interdisciplinary approach are essentially necessary to cure the patients from their disease.

Ninety dogs were assigned to one of three treatments: control (control), comprising routine husbandry performed by shelter staff; human contact (HC), where dogs additionally received 2 min positive contact daily with an experimenter; or human contact + toys (HCT), where the additional human contact included the opportunity to interact with toys. Treatments were implemented daily from day 2 (second day in the shelter) until day 6. On day 7, the fear response towards the experimenter was assessed using salivary cortisol concentrations and a human avoidance test. The behavioural parameters measured were approach and withdrawal responses to the experimenter and time spent in each section of the pen while the experimenter was situated at each of three positions outside the pen: 2 m (position 1) or 1 m away from the pen gate (position 2) or crouched against the pen gate (position 3). On day 8, dogs were assessed by the shelter veterinarian for their suitability for adoption by the public. Treatment had no effect on salivary cortisol concentrations or the proportion of dogs selected for adoption. The results indicated that dogs in the HC and HCT treatments spent more time (P = 0.024) at the front of the pen when the experimenter was at position 3 than control dogs (HC 8.8 s, HCT 8.7 s, control 6.6 s from a possible 10 s). For those dogs that were not at the front of the pen when the experimenter was in position 3, a higher (P < 0.05) percentage of HCT dogs (100%) but not HC dogs (86%, P > 0.05) approached the experimenter compared with control dogs (45%). A second experiment on another 40 dogs examined if dogs, based on their behaviour in the human avoidance test, discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans. All dogs received the HC protocol as in Experiment 1 and were observed in the human avoidance test, however, all dogs were tested twice, once with the 'familiar' experimenter and once with an 'unfamiliar' experimenter. There were no significant (P > 0.05) familiarity or testing order effects, except that dogs approached the unfamiliar experimenter more (60%) than the familiar experimenter (29%) at position 2 (P < 0.05). The results indicate that additional positive human contact other than that associated with routine husbandry reduced the behavioural fear response of dogs to humans, but did not affect the proportion of dogs selected for adoption. The results also indicate that the shelter dogs did not discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans, in the handling context used in this study, suggesting a degree of stimulus generalisation may occur.

These results are of great interest, because the reduction of acquired fear associations is critical in therapies for anxiety disorders. We tested whether findings with respect to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and cannabinoid receptor (CB) systems in animals carry over to healthy human subjects. To that end, we administered selected doses of D-cycloserine (partial NMDA receptor agonist, 250 mg), delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, CB1 receptor agonist, 10 mg), or placebo prior to the extinction session of a 3-day conditioning protocol. D-cycloserine did not affect within-session extinction, or the retention of extinction in healthy human participants, in contrast with patient data but in line with previous reports in healthy volunteers. During extinction training, Delta 9-THC reduced conditioned skin conductance responses, but not fear-potentiated startle. This effect was not retained at the retention test 2 days later, suggesting it was dependent on acute effects of the drug. Our findings implicate that facilitation of the CB1 or NMDA system with the substances used in this study does not affect conditioned fear extinction lastingly in healthy humans. The apparent discrepancy between these findings and the results from (pre-)clinical trials is discussed in terms of room for improvement in these systems in healthy volunteers, and the lack of specificity of THC as a CB1 agonist.","[Baas, Johanna M.

The need to include females arises from the knowledge gap of mechanistic processes underlying the behavioral and neural differences observed in fear extinction. Moreover, the exact contribution of sex and hormones in relation to learning and behavior is still largely unknown. Insights from this field could be beneficial as fear-related disorders are twice as prevalent in women compared to men. Here, we review an up-to-date summary of animal and human studies in adulthood that report sex differences in fear extinction from a structural and functional approach. Furthermore, we describe how these factors could contribute to the observed sex differences in fear extinction during normal and pathological conditions.","[Velasco, E.

As widespread apex predators, humans present a significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain lions Puma concolor to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Mendocino County, California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct, contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for prey. Our study highlights the importance of temporal partitioning as a mechanism of predation risk avoidance.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; McInturff, Alex; Brashares, Justin S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,,,California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Rhodes Trust; Safari Club International Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Schmidt Science Fellows in partnership with Rhodes Trust; Safari Club International Foundation; National Science Foundation,,66,0,0,16,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Laboratory animal studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning suggest that the amygdala is important for both forming stimulus associations and for subsequently expressing learned behavioral responses. In the present article, human amygdala activity was studied during the autonomic expression of conditional fear in two differential conditioning experiments with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and concurrent recording of skin conductance responses (SCRs). Trials were classified on the basis of individual participants' SCRs. Significant amygdala responding was detected only during trials on which a signal both predicted shock and elicited significant conditional SCR. Conditional stimulus presentation or autonomic activity alone was not sufficient. These results indicate that amygdala activity may specifically reflect the expression of learned fear responses and support the position that this region plays a central role in the expression of emotional reactions.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",,"Helmstetter, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",fjh@uwm.edu,"Smith, Christine N/K-1464-2018","Smith, Christine N/0000-0002-7760-4131; Helmstetter, Fred/0000-0003-3413-2418; Knight, David/0000-0002-1094-801X","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH060668] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH060668, MH060668] Funding Source: Medline",,,38,88,89,2,14,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

Recent nonhuman animal work suggests that BDNF is also crucial for amygdala-dependent associative learning. The present study sought to examine fear conditioning as a function of the BDNF polymorphism. Fifty-seven participants were genotyped for the BDNF polymorphism and took part in a differential-conditioning paradigm. Participants were shocked following a particular conditioned stimulus (CS+) and were also presented with stimuli that ranged in perceptual similarity to the CS+ (20, 40 or 60% smaller or larger than the CS+). The eye blink component of the startle response was measured to quantify fear conditioning; post-task shock likelihood ratings for each stimulus were also obtained. All participants reported that shock likelihood varied with perceptual similarity to the CS+ and showed potentiated startle in response to CS +/- 20% stimuli. However, only the Val/Val group had potentiated startle responses to the CS+. Met allele carrying individuals were characterized by deficient fear conditioning - evidenced by an attenuated startle response to CS+ stimuli. Variation in the BDNF genotype appears related to abnormal fear conditioning, consistent with nonhuman animal work on the importance of BDNF in amygdala-dependent associative learning. The relation between genetic variation in BDNF and amygdala-dependent associative learning deficits is discussed in terms of potential mechanisms of risk for psychopathology.","[Hajcak, G.; Castille, C.; Olvet, D.

Their adrenocortical responses to one of three treatments were then examined. These were: no human disturbance (undisturbed controls, CON), capture and return to the home cage before recapture and bleeding after 5 min (CR), or capture and manual restraint for 5 min before blood sampling (CREST). Quail of the HS line showed more fear-related behavior (crouching, escape) and avoidance of the experimenter than did their LS counterparts. Plasma B concentrations were markedly elevated following each capture treatment (CREST > CR) and the response appeared to be more pronounced in quail of the HS than the LS line. These findings indicate that HS quail perceived human contact to be more aversive than did those of the LS line. Avoidance scores and the adrenocortical responses to capture were positively correlated within individual birds. Therefore, simple behavioral tests of fear may have predictive value concerning physiological responsiveness to stressful stimulation.","LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,CTR AGR,DEPT POULTRY SCI,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803",,"JONES, RB (corresponding author), ROSLIN INST EDINBURGH,ROSLIN EH25 9PS,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,32,73,74,0,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0031-9384,,,PHYSIOL BEHAV,Physiol.

Previous human studies have shown that both the baseline and the fear-potentiated responses can be inhibited by anxiety-relieving drugs, suggesting drug activity on two different emotional states, the former reflecting a resting condition and the latter more akin to pathological anxiety. Objectives: To examine to which extent the reductions induced by a benzodiazepine on the basic and the fear-potentiated startle responses are of equal intensity, and whether or not the drug shows a predominant, i.e., selective, effect on either. Methods: The effects of three increasing doses of the benzodiazepine alprazolam (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg) were assessed on the human baseline and fear-potentiated startle responses. Twelve healthy volunteers attended the laboratory on four experimental days and received either alprazolam or placebo according to a double-blind crossover balanced design. Startle recordings were undertaken 2 h after drug intake. Fear potentiation was implemented by means of an electric-shock-anticipation experimental procedure. Additionally, subjective self-reports of sedation and anxiety and psychomotor performance were obtained at 2 and 3 h, respectively, after drug administration. Results: Alprazolam dose-dependently impaired psychomotor performance and produced increases in subjective anxiolytic activity and sedation, although the latter did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, the drug reduced the magnitude of the startle response both in the absence and in the presence of a threat-related cue, although a differentially greater inhibitory effect was seen on the fear-potentiated response as the dose increased. Conclusions: Alprazolam showed a greater inhibitory effect on the fear-potentiated startle than on the baseline reflex, suggesting a more selective action of the drug on those structures mediating potentiation of the behavioral response by anxiety.","Hosp Santa Cruz & San Pablo, Inst Recerca, Area Invest Farmacol, Barcelona 08025, Spain; Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Farmacol & Terapeut, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; Otto von Guericke Univ, Dept Neuropsychol, D-39112 Magdeburg, Germany",,"Barbanoj, MJ (corresponding author), Hosp Santa Cruz & San Pablo, Inst Recerca, Area Invest Farmacol, St Antoni Maria Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain.",,"Rodriguez-Fornells, Antoni/L-5878-2014","Rodriguez-Fornells, Antoni/0000-0002-3249-6931; Riba, Jordi/0000-0002-9375-8421",,,,41,50,50,1,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,OCT,2001,157,4,,,,,358,367,,10.1007/s002130100816,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,483UW,WOS:000171655100004,11605094,,,,2022-04-16,

Pupil dilations in response to conditioned stimuli are increasingly used as a robust psychophysiological readout of fear learning, but their neural correlates remain unknown. We aimed at identifying the neural correlates of pupil responses to threat and safety cues during a fear learning task. Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects underwent a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pupillometry. After a stringent preprocessing and artifact rejection procedure, trial-wise pupil responses to threat and safety cues were entered as parametric modulations to the fMRI general linear models. Results: Trial-wise magnitude of pupil responses to both conditioned and safety stimuli correlated positively with activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and insula for the entire fear learning task, and with activity in the dACC during the fear conditioning phase in particular. Phasic pupil responses did not show habituation, but were negatively correlated with tonic baseline pupil diameter, which decreased during the task. Correcting phasic pupil responses for the tonic baseline pupil diameter revealed thalamic activity, which was also observed in an analysis employing a linear (declining) time modulation. Conclusion: Pupil dilations during fear conditioning and extinction provide useful readouts to track fear learning on a trial-by-trial level, particularly with simultaneous fMRI. Whereas phasic pupil responses reflect activity in brain regions involved in fear learning and threat appraisal, most prominently in dACC, tonic changes in pupil diameter may reflect changes in general arousal.","[Leuchs, Laura; Schneider, Max; Czisch, Michael; Spoormaker, Victor I.] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, D-80804 Munich, Germany",,"Spoormaker, VI (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Dept Translat Res Psychiat, Kraepelinstr 2-10, D-80804 Munich, Germany.",spoormaker@psych.mpg.de,,,Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities,VS acknowledges financial support by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

Such models have shown fear conditioning disrupts subsequent rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Here, we provide a translation of these models into humans. Using the fear potentiated startle (FPS) procedure, we examined the effects of fear conditioning and safety signal learning on subsequent REM sleep in healthy adults. We also examined the effects of changes in REM sleep on retention of fear and safety learning. Participants (n = 42 normal controls) spent 3 consecutive nights in the laboratory. The first was an adaptation night. Following the second night, we administered a FPS procedure that included pairing a wrist shock with a threat signal and a safety signal never paired with a shock. The next day, we administered the FPS procedure again, with no wrist shocks to any stimulus, to measure retention of fear and safety. Canonical correlations assessed the relationship between FPS response and REM sleep. Results demonstrated that increased safety signal learning during the initial acquisition phase was associated with increased REM sleep consolidation that night, with 28.4% of the variance in increased REM sleep consolidation from baseline accounted for by safety signal learning. Overnight REM sleep was, in turn, related to overnight retention of fear and safety learning, with 22.5% of the variance in startle retention accounted for by REM sleep. These data suggest that sleep difficulties, specifically REM sleep fragmentation, may play a mechanistic role in post-traumatic stress disorder via an influence on safety signal learning and/or threat-safety discrimination.","[Marshall, Anisa J.; Acheson, Dean T.; Risbrough, Victoria B.; Straus, Laura D.] Vet Adm San Diego Healthcare Syst, Res Serv, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Drummond, Sean P.

In the last decade, a renewed and growing interest in non-human primate models has resulted from the use of the small callitrichid species in behavioral pharmacology and neuroscience. This review focuses on the available non-human primate models for investigating fear/anxiety, addressing their advantages, shortcomings, and conceptual framework on which they are based. Lastly, a new ethologically based model to study anxiety and fear-induced avoidance in callitrichids-the marmoset predator confrontation test-is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Contrary to previous behavioral-neural (fMRI) research on fear learning-in which the emotional expression of fear was generally indexed by skin conductance-we used fear-potentiated startle, a more reliable and specific index of fear. While we obtained concurrent fear-potentiated startle, neuroimaging (fMRI), and US-expectancy data, healthy participants underwent a fear-conditioning paradigm in which one of two conditioned stimuli (CS+ but not CS-) was paired with a shock (unconditioned stimulus [US]). Fear learning was evident from the differential expressions of fear (CS+ > CS-) at both the behavioral level (startle potentiation and US expectancy) and the neural level (in amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and insula). We examined individual differences in discriminative fear conditioning by classifying participants (as conditionable vs. unconditionable) according to whether they showed successful differential startle potentiation. This revealed that the individual differences in the emotional expression of discriminative fear learning (startle potentiation) were reflected in differential amygdala activation, regardless of the cognitive expression of fear learning (CS-US contingency or hippocampal activation). Our study provides the first evidence for the potential of examining startle potentiation in concurrent fMRI research on fear learning.","[Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Kindt, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Roetersstr 15, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.kindt@uva.nl,"Scholte, H.Steven/ABD-1737-2020","Scholte, H.Steven/0000-0002-9839-1788; Visser, Renee/0000-0003-0376-8165",,,,65,59,59,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1530-7026,,,COGN AFFECT BEHAV NE,Cogn.

The flight (time to join peers and avoidance distance), docility (isolation and handling) and fear (4 phases; responses of isolated heifers in (i), the absence (ii), the presence, of food and responses to a stationary human (iii) without and (iv) with visual contact with their peers) tests were carried out over three consecutive days, in that order, commencing on day 30 and again on day 81 post-housing. Animals were blood sampled twice, in a chute, between the two test sessions. Scores (low scores = more fearful) were assigned to the fear responses. Ten out of 19 variables were consistent over time. Consistency was more evident in the presence of a human, whereas agitation and avoidance of the animals were the most reliable measures. For each session, Principal Component Analysis showed that these behaviours were also consistent within different situations and that the two first components explained more than 55% of the variation of the data. Crossbred heifers showed stability for the consistent behaviours while purebred heifers were more fearful during the second test session. This study showed that fearfulness is a multi dimensional construct and that genetic factors as well as environmental factors affected the behavioural responses. Human-animal relationship can be assessed by measuring agitation while general fearfulness requires tests measuring different dimensions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Women are at a higher risk for PTSD than men. Levels of circulating 17-beta estradiol (E2) in women have been linked to deficits in fear extinction and extinction recall. In PTSD, fear learning coincides with acute traumatic stress. However, little is known about the possible interaction between stress exposure and hormone status on fear acquisition and extinction learning. In a 2-day, 2 x 3 between-subjects design with healthy participants, we examined the effects of stress (psychosocial stressor vs. control, placed 45 min prior to conditioning) and natural E2-status on differential fear conditioning, covering fear acquisition, immediate extinction (Day 1), and 24 h-delayed extinction recall (Day 2). To operationalize E2-status, we compared women in the early follicular phase (EF) of their menstrual cycle (low E2, low progesterone plasma levels), women in the midcycle phase (MC, high E2, low progesterone), and men. Conditioning was indicated by differential skin conductance responses. We found an interaction between stress exposure and natural E2-status in women only: In MC-women, extinction recall on Day 2 (24h after initial extinction training) was better when fear acquisition had been preceded by stress. In EF-women, the inverse was true. We show that extinction recall of conditioned fear acquired after stress depends on estrogen status in women. Therefore, extinction-based exposure therapy in free-cycling female anxiety patients should take cycle status into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Impaired fear extinction and enhanced fear acquisition and consolidation are hallmarks of fear-circuitry disorders; thus, we tested whether BL facilitates fear extinction and inhibits fear acquisition. We randomly exposed 29 healthy humans to high-(9000 lx) or low-intensity light (< 500 lx) for 15 min, near the nadir of the phase response to light, in a single-blind manner. Simultaneously with the light exposure, subjects performed fear extinction training and second fear acquisition, where a visual conditioned stimulus (CS), previously paired with an electric shock unconditioned stimulus (US), was presented without the US, while another CS was newly paired with the US. Conditioned responses (CRs) and changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity were determined during encoding and delayed recall sessions. BL-exposed subjects exhibited lower extinction related PFC activity and marginally higher acquisition-related PFC activity during light exposure than subjects exposed to control light. Twenty-four hours later, BL reduced CRs to both the extinguished and non-extinguished CSs with marginally lower extinction-related PFC activation, suggesting that BL enhanced fear extinction, while suppressing fear acquisition. Further, EL sustained tolerance to fear re-conditioning. Our results demonstrate that a single and brief BL exposure, synchronized with fear extinction and acquisition, instantaneously influences prefrontal hemodynamic responses and alleviates fear expression after 24 h. Although the specificity of BL effects deems further investigation, our findings indicate the clinical relevance of adjunctive BL intervention in exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for fear-circuitry disorders.","[Yoshiike, Takuya; Honma, Motoyasu; Kim, Yoshiharu; Kuriyama, Kenichi] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Behav Med, 4-1-1 Ogawa Higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan; [Yoshiike, Takuya; Yamada, Naoto; Kuriyama, Kenichi] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Psychiat, Seta Tsukinowa Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan; [Honma, Motoyasu] Kyorin Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Physiol, 6-20-2 Shinkawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818611, Japan",,"Yoshiike, T (corresponding author), Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Psychiat, Seta Tsukinowa Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan.",yoshiike@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp; mhonma@ks.kyorin-u.ac.jp; naoto@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp; kim@ncnp.go.jp; kenichik@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp,"Yoshiike, Takuya/AAL-5150-2020; Honma, Motoyasu/M-7124-2018","Yoshiike, Takuya/0000-0002-6071-8167; Honma, Motoyasu/0000-0003-4612-0115","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program from the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Corporation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25670122, 15H04897]; Japan Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental HealthJapan Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental Health; Takeda Science FoundationTakeda Science Foundation (TSF); SENSHIN Medical Research FoundationSENSHIN Medical Research Foundation","We thank Professor Yoko Hoshi for her thoughtful suggestions on neuroimaging analyses.

Clinically, fear memory is also involved in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the neural mechanisms of fear thereby has both neuroscientific and clinical significance. In recent years, data from animal models have demonstrated the key role of the amygdala-hippocampal circuit in the development of fear. However, the neural processing of fear memory remains unclear in humans, which is mainly due to the limitation of indirect measure of neural activity. Methods Herein, we investigated fear memory by direct intracranial recordings from 8 intractable epilepsy patients with depth electrodes in both the hippocampus and ipsilateral amygdala. All the patients were subjected to a well-established Pavlovian fear memory paradigm consisted of the familiarization task, conditioning task, and retrieval task, respectively. Simultaneous local field potentials from the hippocampus and amygdala were recorded during different stages. The oscillatory activities from the amygdala and hippocampus were analyzed during fear memory retrieval compared with neutral stages. Results Consistent with previous rodent studies, our results showed that the amygdala was involved in fear memory retrieval rather than neutral memory retrieval, while the hippocampus was involved both in fear memory retrieval and neutral memory retrieval. In particular, we found that there was an enhanced synchronized activity between the amygdala and hippocampus at beta frequencies (14-30 Hz), which suggested that enhanced synchronized activity at beta frequencies between the amygdala and hippocampus play a pivotal role during retrieval of fear memory in human. Conclusions Thus, our observation that the amygdala-hippocampal system contributing to fear memory retrieval in human with frequency-depended specificity has provided new insights into the mechanism of fear and have potential clinical relevance.","[Wang, Di; Huang, Zhaoyang; Ren, Liankun; Hu, Minjing; Wang, Xueming; Du, Jialin; Wang, Yuping] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Neurol, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Wang, Di; Huang, Zhaoyang; Ren, Liankun; Hu, Minjing; Wang, Xueming; Du, Jialin; Wang, Yuping] Beijing Key Lab Neuromodulat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xueyuan; Yu, Tao; Ni, Duanyu; Zhang, Xi; Gao, Runshi; Qiao, Liang] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Funct Neurosurg, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xueyuan; Yu, Tao; Ni, Duanyu; Zhang, Xi; Gao, Runshi; Qiao, Liang] Beijing Inst Funct Neurosurg, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuping] Capital Med Univ, Ctr Epilepsy, Beijing Inst Brain Disorders, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuping] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Pediat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China",,"Wang, YP (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Neurol, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China.; Wang, YP (corresponding author), Beijing Key Lab Neuromodulat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China.; Wang, YP (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Ctr Epilepsy, Beijing Inst Brain Disorders, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China.; Wang, YP (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Pediat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China.",wangyuping@xwhosp.org,,"Liu, Jing/0000-0002-9167-6190","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81771398, 81571271]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1314500]","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81771398, 81571271) and the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1314500).

Fear memories can be attenuated by using extinction during the malleable period. The present study adopts a novel form of extinction, using verbal instructions, in order to examine whether fear memory reconsolidation can be affected by an imaginal exposure. The extinction using verbal instructions, called imaginal extinction, consists of a recorded voice encouraging participants to imagine the scene in which fear was acquired, and to envision the stimuli before their inner eye. The voice signals stimuli appearance, and identical to standard (in vivo) extinction, participants discover that the conditioned stimulus no longer is followed by unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In this way, imaginal extinction translates clinically used imaginal exposure into the standard experimental fear conditioning paradigm. Fear was acquired by pairing pictorial stimuli with an electric shock UCS. Then, both standard and imaginal extinction were given following fear memory reactivation, either after 10 min, within the reconsolidation interval, or after 6 h, outside of the reconsolidation interval. In vivo and imaginal extinction produced comparable reductions in conditioned responses during extinction and importantly, both disrupted reconsolidation of conditioned fear and abolished stimulus discrimination between reinforced and non-reinforced cues. Thus, disrupted reconsolidation of fear conditioning can be achieved without in vivo stimulus presentation, through purely cognitive means, suggesting possible therapeutic applications.

Since there is typically a delay between an initial fear experience and a situation in which fear (over)generalization may occur, we assessed delayed fear generalization and its neural signature. Moreover, as stress is known to affect fear learning, we further tested whether acute stress modulates fear generalization. Therefore, we conducted a two-day fear generalization study, with initial fear acquisition on Day 1 and a fear generalization test after a 24-hr delay in the MRI scanner. Prior to fear generalization testing, participants were exposed to a stressor or a control manipulation. Our behavioral data showed the expected generalization of fear. At a neural level, fear generalization was accompanied by increased fear-signaling for stimuli that resembled the conditioned stimulus in the bilateral insula and frontal operculum, whereas activity declined in frontal, hippocampal, and temporal regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, as stimuli became more similar to the conditioned stimulus. Importantly, stress did not modulate fear generalization, neither on a behavioral nor on a neural level. Interestingly, in an explorative comparison to two other studies that used the same paradigm but tested generalization immediately after acquisition, we observed increased fear generalization in the delayed relative to the immediate generalization test. In sum, our results suggest that stress leaves fear generalization and its neural signature unaffected but that a temporal delay might increase the extent to which fear responses are generalized to stimuli resembling the threatening stimulus.","[Kausche, Franziska Magdalena; Zerbes, Gundula; Schwabe, Lars] Univ Hamburg, Dept Cognit Psychol, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Kampermann, Lea; Buechel, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany",,"Schwabe, L (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Dept Cognit Psychol, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",lars.schwabe@uni-hamburg.de,,"Kausche, Franziska/0000-0002-1399-4708; Schwabe, Lars/0000-0003-4429-4373",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG),"This work was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG), in the context of the collaborative research center SFB/TRR58 Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorder",,49,0,0,9,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,NOV,2021,58,11,,,,,,,e13917,10.1111/psyp.13917,,AUG 2021,16,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,WC7AF,WOS:000682735500001,34365641,hybrid,,,2022-04-16,

Identification of novel strategies to enhance fear extinction and reduce fear relapse is of paramount importance to mental health. Exercise can enhance cognitive function, but it is not yet well understood whether exercise can be an effective augmentation strategy for fear extinction. In the current review, we present the current state of knowledge on the effects of exercise on fear extinction. Effects of exercise duration, explanations for conflicting results, and potential mechanisms, focusing on a hypothesized role for dopamine, are all discussed. We also provide new data suggesting that the timing in which acute exercise occurs relative to fear extinction, is a crucial variable in determining whether exercise can enhance fear extinction.

Therefore, its reduction is an important objective. Modifying the chicken-human relationship, perhaps via some form of regular handling or other human contact, is thought to be one way of achieving this objective. However, it is necessary to determine whether habituation (taming) of chicks to one particular person will generalise. Therefore, in the present study the approach/avoidance responses of handled (H) and nonhandled (NH) female ISA Brown domestic chicks towards a visible experimenter were examined in a series of five experiments in which the chicks' previous experience of humans and/or the experimenter's identity or clothing (colour and style) were systematically varied. Sample sizes in Experiments 1 to 5 were 20, 10, 10, 30 and 25 respectively. As expected, in each experiment, those chicks which had been handled twice daily from 1 day of age showed substantially less avoidance of the experimenter than did their nonhandled counterparts when they were tested at 10 or 11 days of age. Indeed, collective means of the summed mean scores of all the treatment groups used were 36.7 and 45.6 for H and NH, respectively. These results confirmed numerous observations that regular gentle handling is a reliable and potent method of reducing chicks' fear of humans. The present study also yielded a number of novel findings. In Experiment I, the chicks' habituation to one handler readily generalised to include a similarly dressed but otherwise unfamiliar experimenter of the opposite sex. The results of Experiments 2 and 3 extended this finding and showed that handled chicks responded similarly towards the experimenter regardless of systematic variations in the identities of either their handler or of the person who subsequently captured and tested the chick. Changing the colour (Experiment 4) or the style (Experiment 5) of the experimenter's clothing from that worn during treatment to that worn at test also failed to significantly influence the chicks' fear of humans, although a numerical trend towards reduced avoidance of the familiar clothing was apparent in both experiments. Collectively, the present results suggest that chickens which have been habituated to one person via regular handling will also show reduced fear of other people wearing either similar or different types of clothing. The apparent flexibility of the handling phenomenon is discussed in terms of its practical relevance.",,,"JONES, RB (corresponding author), ROSLIN INST EDINBURGH,ROSLIN EH25 9PS,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,49,47,47,2,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1591,,,APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI,Appl.

Human studies suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a role similar to PL in mediating or modulating fear responses. This study examined the role of dACC during fear conditioning in healthy humans with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Novel analyses were conducted on data from two cohorts that had previously undergone scanning to study fear extinction. Structural and functional brain data were acquired with MRI; the functional MRI (fMRI) component employed an event-related design. Skin conductance response (SCR) was the index of conditioned responses. Results: We found that: 1) cortical thickness within dACC is positively correlated with SCR during conditioning; 2) dACC is activated by a conditioned fear stimulus; and 3) this activation is positively correlated with differential SCR. Moreover, the dACC region implicated in this research corresponds to the target of anterior cingulotomy, an ablative surgical treatment for patients with mood and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Convergent structural, functional, and lesion findings from separate groups of subjects suggest that dACC mediates or modulates fear expression in humans. Collectively, these data implicate this territory as a potential target for future anti-anxiety therapies.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Nucl Magenet Resonance Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; McLean Hosp, Belmont, MA 02178 USA; Univ Puerto Rico, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, Manchester, NH USA",,"Milad, MR (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Bldg 149,13th St,2nd Floor, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",milad@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu,"Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018",,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH072156] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1R21MH072156-1] Funding Source: Medline,,,41,348,356,1,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Direct comparisons between child and adult populations are needed to determine developmental risk markers of fear and anxiety. We compared 267 children and 285 adults in a differential fear conditioning paradigm and generalization test. Skin conductance responses (SCR) and ratings of valence and arousal were obtained to indicate fear learning. Both groups displayed robust and similar differential conditioning on subjective and physiological levels. However, children showed heightened fear generalization compared to adults as indexed by higher arousal ratings and SCR to the generalization stimuli. Results indicate overgeneralization of conditioned fear as a developmental correlate of fear learning. The developmental change from a shallow to a steeper generalization gradient is likely related to the maturation of brain structures that modulate efficient discrimination between danger and (ambiguous) safety cues.

The conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) (shock) during conditioning in the paired but not in the unpaired group. In the reaction time (RT) group, the US was a nonaversive visual signal for an RT task. In the paired group, the CS potentiated startle in the postconditioning phase. This conditioned response was fully retained over the retention interval. There was no substantial change in baseline startle (startle delivered in the absence of CS). By contrast, startle was not potentiated by the CS in the unpaired group, but baseline startle was increased from Session 1 to Session 2. In the RT group, startle was not affected by the CS, and baseline startle was reduced from Session 1 to Session 2. These results suggest that paired presentations of a CS and an aversive US result in conditioned fear in response to the CS but little contextual fear, whereas unpaired presentations of a CS and US leads to poor explicit cue conditioning but substantial contextual fear.","CONNECTICUT MENTAL HLTH CTR,NEW HAVEN,CT",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PSYCHIAT,40 TEMPLE ST GERU,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510, USA.",,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P01MH025642, R01MH047840, R37MH047840, R29MH050720] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1 R29 MH50720, MH-25642, MH-47840] Funding Source: Medline",,,53,167,171,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211",0048-5772,,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,JUL,1997,34,4,,,,,451,458,,10.1111/j.1469-8986.1997.tb02389.x,,,8,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,XP338,WOS:A1997XP33800008,9260498,,,,2022-04-16,

In Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) depend on a nearly continuous intake of berries, especially bilberries (Vaccinium myrtilius) during late summer and early autumn to fatten up prior to hibernation. This overlaps with the bear hunting season that starts on 21 August. Bilberry occurrence varies across space, as does human-induced mortality risk. Here, we hypothesize that brown bears select for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence across a boreal forest ecosystem in Sweden (H1), and that human-induced mortality risk reduces bear selection for bilberries (H2). In addition, we hypothesized that hears that survived the hunting season avoided bilberry areas associated with high risk, whereas bears that were later killed selected more strongly for berries and less against risk prior to the hunting season (H3). To evaluate our hypotheses, we used resource selection functions to contrast bear GPS relocation data (N = 3 5, 2012-2015) and random positions within the bears home range with generalized linear mixed effect models against two focal variables: a map predicting bilberry occurrence and a map predicting human-induced mortality risk. We found that bears selected for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence (supporting H1), but avoided these areas if they were associated with and high risk of hunting mortality (supporting H2). The killed and surviving bears did not differ in their selection for bilberries, hut they did differ in their selection against risk (partially supporting H3). Surviving bears strongly avoided high risk areas, whereas killed hears responded less to risk and selected for high-risk areas with a low probability of bilberry occurrence. This suggests that killed bears selected for other food sources than berries in high risk areas, which exposed them to human hunters. We conclude that bears respond to a landscape of fear during the berry season and that different foraging strategies may have a direct impact on individual mortality during the hunting season.

Accurately identifying which children are at the highest risk is of critical importance, especially if we can identify risk early in development. We examined continued risk for social anxiety symptoms at the transition to adolescence in a community sample of children (n = 112) that had been observed for high fearfulness at age 2 and tracked for social anxiety symptoms from preschool through age 6. In our previous studies, we found that a pattern of dysregulated fear (DF), characterized by high fear in low threat contexts, predicted social anxiety symptoms at ages 3, 4, 5, and 6 years across two samples. In the current study, we re-evaluated these children at 11-13 years of age by using parent and child reports of social anxiety symptoms, parental monitoring, and peer relationship quality.

A core component of these disorders is an unremitting fear in the absence of present threat. One of the most commonly used therapies to treat these disorders is exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy that identifies the source of the fear and anxiety and then desensitizes the individual to it. This treatment builds on basic principles of fear-extinction learning. A number of patients improve with this therapy, but 40-50% do not. This paper provides an overview of recent empirical studies employing both human imaging and cross-species behavioral genetics to examine how fear regulation varies across individuals and across development, especially during adolescence. These studies have important implications for understanding who may be at risk for anxiety disorders and for whom and when during development exposure-based therapies may be most effective.","[Hartley, Catherine A.; Casey, B.

The study included a convenience sample of 107 high-risk, community-dwelling, mostly Black (94%) members from one Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly program. The FOF scale is one-item asking to rate overall concern about falling, while the FES-I is 16-items rating concern about falling during physical and social activities. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis were highly significant (F-value = 22.25, R-squared = 0.39, p < 0.0001).

To investigate this question, we sought commonalities between experimentally-induced fear via electric shocks and pre-existing phobia. Using functional MRI, we tested the effect of fear-conditioning pictures of dogs in 21 spider-fearful participants across three phases: baseline, post-conditioning, and extinction. Considering phobic stimuli as a reference point for the state of fear allowed us to examine whether fear-conditioning renders information patterns of previously neutral stimuli more similar to those of phobic stimuli. We trained a classification algorithm to discriminate information patterns of neutral stimuli (rats) and phobic stimuli and then tested the algorithm on information patterns from the conditioned stimuli (dogs). Performing this cross-decoding analysis at each experimental phase revealed brain regions in which dogs were classified as rats during baseline, as spiders following conditioning, and again as rats after extinction. A follow-up analysis showed that changes in visual perception information cannot explain the changing classification performance. These results demonstrate a common neural representation for processing fear-eliciting information, either pre-existing or acquired by classical conditioning.","[Levine, Seth M.; Rupprecht, Rainer; Schwarzbach, Jens V.] Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Str 84, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Pfaller, Michael; Reichenberger, Jonas; Shiban, Youssef; Muehlberger, Andreas] Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",,"Schwarzbach, JV (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Str 84, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",jens.schwarzbach@ukr.de,,,,,,38,6,6,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1749-5016,1749-5024,,SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR,Soc.

Exposure to human activity can cause animals to avoid human dominated areas or shift temporal activity patterns, but repeated, benign exposure can also result in habituation of individuals. Habituation is typically viewed as a negative potential consequence of human interactions with wildlife, with effects such as increased vulnerability of habituated animals to predation. Concurrently, the advancement of the understanding of the ecology of fear has shown reduced fitness in species because of behavioral changes in responses to fear of predators including humans. Here, we test how habituation and fear drive the foraging ecology of brown bears (Ursus arctos) feeding on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Southeast Alaska, USA. We used motion-detecting trail cameras at salmon spawning areas across a gradient of human disturbance to record human and bear activity at fine spatial and extended temporal scales. Higher human activity was associated with increased nocturnality of non-habituated bears, likely leading to suboptimal foraging, but had no effect on habituated individuals. For the top 20% of sites for which human activity was greatest, an average of 78.7% of the activity of non habituated bears was nocturnal, compared with an average of only 10.2% of the activity of habituated individuals. Habituation of brown bears in this system alleviated perceived risk and avoidance of human activity, allowing habituated individuals to overcome their fear of human presence and maximize foraging opportunities. While habituation may lessen some of the deleterious effects of human activity on large carnivores, the long-term effects of habituation may be negative, as habituated individuals may be at greater risk of depredation. Future research should examine whether habituated bears and their lower perceived risk of human activity ultimately experience smaller population-level effects of human disturbance than non-habituated individuals.","[Wheat, Rachel E.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Wheat, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rwheat@ucsc.edu,,,NSF GRFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This work was funded by an NSF GRF to R.E.W.

Previous work has suggested both propensities for over control and under-control of fearfulness as risk factors for anxiety problems, each of which may be relevant to observations of dysregulated fear. Given difficulty disentangling over-control and under control through traditional behavioral measures, we used delta-beta coupling to begin to understand the degree to which dysregulated fear may reflect propensities for over- or under-control. We found that toddlers who showed high levels of dysregulated fear evidenced greater delta-beta coupling at frontal and central electrode sites as preschoolers relative to children who were low in dysregulated fear. Importantly, these differences were not observed when comparisons were made based on fear levels in high threat contexts. Results suggest dysregulated fear may involve tendencies toward over-control at the neural level. (C) 2015 The Authors.

It has long been known that fear serves to motivate avoidance. Consequently, fear extinction has been the primary focus in pre-clinical anxiety research for decades, under the implicit assumption that removing the motivator of avoidance (fear) would automatically mitigate the avoidance behaviors as well. Although this assumption has intuitive appeal, it has received little scientific scrutiny. The scarce evidence from animal studies is mixed, while the assumption remains untested in humans. The current study applied an avoidance conditioning protocol in humans to investigate the effects of fear extinction on the persistence of low-cost avoidance. Online danger-safety ratings and skin conductance responses documented the dynamics of conditioned fear across avoidance and extinction phases. Anxiety- and avoidance-related questionnaires explored individual differences in rates of avoidance. Participants first learned to click a button during a predictive danger signal, in order to cancel an upcoming aversive electrical shock (avoidance conditioning). Next, fear extinction was induced by presenting the signal in the absence of shocks while button-clicks were prevented (by removing the button in Experiment 1, or by instructing not to click the button in Experiment 2). Most importantly, post extinction availability of the button caused a significant return of avoidant button-clicks. In addition, trait-anxiety levels correlated positively with rates of avoidance during a predictive safety signal, and with the rate of pre- to post-extinction decrease during this signal. Fear measures gradually decreased during avoidance conditioning, as participants learned that button clicks effectively canceled the shock. Preventing button-clicks elicited a sharp increase in fear, which subsequently extinguished. Fear remained low during avoidance testing, but danger-safety ratings increased again when button-clicks were subsequently prevented. Together, these results show that low-cost avoidance behaviors can persist following fear extinction and induce increased threat appraisal. On the other hand, fear extinction did reduce augmented rates of unnecessary avoidance during safety in trait-anxious individuals, and instruction-based response prevention was more effective than removal of response cues.

Recently, we demonstrated that disrupting reconsolidation by a pharmacological manipulation specifically targeted the emotional expression of memory (i.e., startle response). Here we test in a human differential fear-conditioning paradigm with fear-relevant stimuli whether the spacing of a single unreinforced retrieval trial relative to extinction learning allows for rewriting the original fear association, thereby preventing the return of fear. In contrast to previous findings reported by Schiller et al. (2010), who used a single-method for indexing fear (skin conductance response) and fear-irrelevant stimuli, we found that extinction learning within the reconsolidation window did not prevent the recovery of fear on multiple indices of conditioned responding (startle response, skin conductance response and US-expectancy). These conflicting results ask for further critical testing given the potential impact on the field of emotional memory and its application to clinical practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Despite recent conceptual advances and potential management implications of the ecology of fear, theory and conservation practices have rarely been linked. Many challenges in animal conservation may be alleviated by actively harnessing or compensating for risk perception and risk avoidance behavior in wild animal populations. Integration of the ecology of fear into conservation and management practice can contribute to the recovery of threatened populations, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, invasive species management, maintenance of sustainable harvest and species reintroduction plans. Here, we present an applied framework that links conservation interventions to desired outcomes by manipulating ecology of fear dynamics. We discuss how to reduce or amplify fear in wild animals by manipulating habitat structure, sensory stimuli, animal experience (previous exposure to risk) and food safety trade-offs to achieve management objectives. Changing the optimal decision-making of individuals in managed populations can then further conservation goals by shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of animals, changing predation rates and altering risk effects that scale up to demographic consequences. We also outline future directions for applied research on fear ecology that will better inform conservation practices. Our framework can help scientists and practitioners anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences of management decisions, and highlight new levers for multi-species conservation strategies that promote human-wildlife coexistence.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX USA; [Gilbert, Sophie L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Kohl, Michel T.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Larson, Courtney L.] Nature Conservancy, Lander, WY USA; [Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Young, Julie K.] USDA, Predator Res Facil, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Millville, UT USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Newsome, Thomas M/ABE-8451-2021; Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Newsome, Thomas M/0000-0003-3457-3256; Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061; Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543; Kohl, Michel/0000-0001-8218-1455; Gilbert, Sophie/0000-0002-9974-5146",Wildlife Society Damage Control Working Group; Schmidt Science Fellows program; Rhodes Trust; USDA -National Wildlife Research CenterUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"This study arose from an organized symposium at The Wildlife Society's 2018 conference in Cleveland, Ohio, When does fear matter in wildlife management?

An open question is whether fear-related brain areas respond differently to experienced CS-US contingencies than to merely instructed CS-US contingencies. Here, we contrasted two experimental conditions where subjects were instructed to expect the same CS-US contingencies while only one condition was characterized by prior experience with the CS-US contingency. Using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, we found CS-related neural activation patterns in the right amygdala (but not in other fear-related regions) that dissociated between whether a CS-US contingency had been instructed and experienced versus merely instructed. A second experiment further corroborated this finding by showing a categoryindependent neural response to instructed and experienced, but not merely instructed, CS presentations in the human right amygdala. Together, these findings are in line with previous studies showing that verbal fear instructions have a strong impact on both brain and behavior. However, even in the face of fear instructions, the human right amygdala still shows a separable neural pattern response to experience-based fear contingencies.","[Braem, Senne; Demanet, Jelle; Brass, Marcel] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Braem, Senne; De Houwer, Xjan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Yuen, Kenneth S.

Thus, we designed a study of human perception of all reptiles focusing on the relationship between perceived fear, disgust, and aesthetic preferences. Respondents evaluated various reptile images and the results revealed that people tend to perceive them as two clearly distinct groups based on their similar morphotypelegless reptiles (incl. snakes) and other reptiles with legs. In the case of snakes, the most feared species also tend to be perceived as beautiful. Compared to the most feared reptiles with legs (lizards, turtle, crocodiles), the legless once tend to be perceived as more disgusting. In both groups, species perceived as the least beautiful were the same as those rated as the most disgusting. Thus, reptiles cannot be rated as both beautiful and disgusting at the same time. Abstract Focusing on one group of animals can bring interesting results regarding our attitudes toward them and show the key features that our evaluation of such animals is based on. Thus, we designed a study of human perception of all reptiles focusing on the relationship between perceived fear, disgust, and aesthetic preferences and differences between snakes and other reptiles. Two sets containing 127 standardized photos of reptiles were developed, with one species per each subfamily. Respondents were asked to rate the animals according to fear, disgust, and beauty on a seven-point Likert scale. Evaluation of reptile species shows that people tend to perceive them as two clearly distinct groups based on their similar morphotype. In a subset of lizards, there was a positive correlation between fear and disgust, while disgust and fear were both negatively correlated with beauty. Surprisingly, a positive correlation between fear and beauty of snakes was revealed, i.e., the most feared species also tend to be perceived as beautiful. Snakes represent a distinct group of animals that is also reflected in the theory of attentional prioritization of snakes as an evolutionary relevant threat.","[Janovcova, Marketa; Sedlackova, Kristyna; Peleskova, Sarka; Zampachova, Barbora; Frynta, Daniel; Landova, Eva] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843, Czech Republic; [Janovcova, Marketa; Radlova, Silvie; Polak, Jakub; Sedlackova, Kristyna; Peleskova, Sarka; Zampachova, Barbora; Frynta, Daniel; Landova, Eva] Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Topolova 748, Klecany 25067, Czech Republic",,"Frynta, D (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843, Czech Republic.; Frynta, D (corresponding author), Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Topolova 748, Klecany 25067, Czech Republic.",Markii47@seznam.cz; Silka@atlas.cz; jakub.polak.cz@gmail.com; kristyna.sedlackova@email.cz; PeleskovaSarka@seznam.cz; barbora.zampachova@seznam.cz; frynta@centrum.cz; evalandova@seznam.cz,"Rdlov, Silvie/D-5532-2017; Polk, Jakub/M-9927-2017; Frynta, Daniel/L-7350-2016","Rdlov, Silvie/0000-0003-3581-9780; Polk, Jakub/0000-0001-5005-3328; Frynta, Daniel/0000-0002-1375-7972; Janovcova, Marketa/0000-0001-7647-8148","GACR (Czech Science Foundation)Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-15991S]; GAUK (Charles University Grant Agency) [346315, 1636218, LO1611]; MEYS under the NPU I program","This research was funded by GACR (Czech Science Foundation) 17-15991S and GAUK (Charles University Grant Agency) nr. 346315 and 1636218.

Meta-analyses of fear extinction learning primarily implicate consistent activation of brain regions linked to threat appraisal and experience, including the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices. An overlapping anatomical result was obtained from the meta-analysis of extinction recall studies, except when studies directly compared an extinguished threat stimulus to an unextinguished threat stimulus (instead of a safety stimulus). In this latter instance, more consistent activation was observed in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions, together with other areas including the hippocampus.

Contingency awareness refers to the ability to verbalize the relationships between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. Although there is a heated debate about the influence of contingency awareness on conditioned fear responses, neural correlates behind the formation process of contingency awareness have gained only little attention in human fear conditioning. Recent animal studies indicate that the ventral striatum (VS) could be involved in this process, but in human studies the VS is mostly associated with positive emotions. To examine this question, we reanalyzed four recently published classical fear conditioning studies (n = 117) with respect to the VS at three distinct levels of contingency awareness: subjects, who did not learn the contingencies (unaware), subjects, who learned the contingencies during the experiment (learned aware) and subjects, who were informed about the contingencies in advance (instructed aware). The results showed significantly increased activations in the left and right VS in learned aware compared to unaware subjects. Interestingly, this activation pattern was only found in learned but not in instructed aware subjects. We assume that the VS is not involved when contingency awareness does not develop during conditioning or when contingency awareness is unambiguously induced already prior to conditioning. VS involvement seems to be important for the transition from a contingency unaware to a contingency aware state. Implications for fear conditioning models as well as for the contingency awareness debate are discussed. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3636-3644, 2009.

In humans mainly functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used. To extend these findings to volumetric properties, 58 healthy participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and participated in a differential fear conditioning paradigm with contextual stimuli. Ratings of emotional valence, arousal, and contingency as well as skin conductance responses (SCRs) were used as indicators of conditioning. Twenty-nine participants with the smallest hippocampal volumes were compared with 29 persons with the largest hippocampal volumes. Persons with larger hippocampal volume (especially on the right side) learned to discriminate between two conditioned contexts, whereas those with small hippocampal volumes did not, as indicated by SCRs. Further analyses showed that these results could not be explained by amygdalar volumes. In contrast, the participant answers on the self-report measures were not significantly influenced by hippocampal or amygdalar, but by total brain volume, suggesting a role of cortical structures in these more cognitive evaluation processes. Reanalysis of the self-report data using partial hippocampal volumes revealed a significant influence of the posterior but not anterior subvolumes, which is in accordance with theories and empirical findings on hippocampal functioning. This study shows the relevance of hippocampal volume for contextual fear conditioning in healthy volunteers and may have important implications for anxiety disorders. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

Within vertebrates, the overall brain plan is highly conserved, though differences in size and complexity also exist. The forebrain differs the most between mammals and other vertebrates. The classic notion that the evolution of mammals led to radical changes such that new forebrain structures (limbic system and neocortex) were added has not held up nor has the idea that so-called limbic areas are primarily involved in emotion. Modern efforts have focused on specific emotion systems, like the fear or defense system, rather than on the search for a general purpose emotion systems. Such studies have found that fear circuits are conserved in mammals, including humans. Animal work has been especially successful in determining how the brain detects and responds to danger. Caution should be exercised when attempting to discuss other aspects of emotion, namely subjective feelings, in animals since there are no scientific ways of verifying and measuring such states except in humans.","NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"LeDoux, JE (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",joseph.ledoux@nyu.edu,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH038774, R01MH046516] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA029053] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01 DA029053] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH038774, R01 MH046516] Funding Source: Medline",,,112,102,104,7,98,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0079-6123,,978-0-44-453867-3; 978-0-44-453860-4,PROG BRAIN RES,Prog.

The first step was to obtain a set of adoptive mothers habituated-to-human (H mothers) and a set of adoptive mothers non-habituated-to-human (NH mothers). A set of 6-month-old adult females was handling daily for 15 successive days whereas another set of 6-month-old adult females received no visual or physical contact with human during the same period. We then obtained two sets of adoptive mothers non-divergent in tonic immobility (TI) duration but divergent by the amount of fear behaviour expressed towards human (human observer test, cage-plus-experimenter test). Then, we compared a set of young raised by H mothers to a set of young raised by NH mothers. Observations and tests were carried out both during the brooding period (between 5 and 12 days of age) and after separation from mothers (between 13 and 90 days of age). Our results revealed that young raised by H mothers were less fearful towards a static human (cage-plus-experimenter test, hand-on-home-cage-door-test) as well as towards a moving human (human observer test and capture test) than young raised by NH mothers. Nevertheless, as was found between the two sets of adoptive mothers, no clear differences were found between the two sets of young concerning general emotional reactivity (tonic immobility test, open field test and hole-in-the-wall test). These results reveal that young bird's emotional reactivity to human could be modulated by the mother and that this maternal influence remains detectable well after the end of maternal contact.

Although fMRI has helped translate insights about the anatomy of underlying brain circuits to humans, the temporal dynamics of neural fear processes remain opaque and require EEG. To date, studies on electrophysiological brain signals in humans have helped to elucidate underlying perceptual and attentional processes, but have widely ignored how fear memory traces evolve over time. The low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG demands aggregations across high numbers of trials, which will wash out transient neurobiological processes that are induced by learning and prone to habituation. Here, our goal was to unravel the plasticity and temporal emergence of EEG responses during fear conditioning. To this end, we developed a new sequential-set fear conditioning paradigm that comprises three successive acquisition and extinction phases, each with a novel CS+/CSset. Each set consists of two different neutral faces on different background colors which serve as CS+ and CS-, respectively. Thereby, this design provides sufficient trials for EEG analyses while tripling the relative amount of trials that tap into more transient neurobiological processes. Consistent with prior studies on ERP components, data-driven topographic EEG analyses revealed that ERP amplitudes were potentiated during time periods from 33-60 ms, 108-200 ms, and 468-820 ms indicating that fear conditioning prioritizes early sensory processing in the brain, but also facilitates neural responding during later attentional and evaluative stages. Importantly, averaging across the three CS+/CS- sets allowed us to probe the temporal evolution of neural processes: Responses during each of the three time windows gradually increased from early to late fear conditioning, while long-latency (460-730 ms) electrocortical responses diminished throughout fear extinction. Our novel paradigm demonstrates how short-, mid-, and long-latency EEG responses change during fear conditioning and extinction, findings that enlighten the learning curve of neurophysiological responses to threat in humans.","[Sperl, Matthias F.

When confronted with a potential threat, an animal must select an appropriate defensive response based on previous experiences that are not identical, weighing cues and contextual information that may predict safety or danger. Like other aspects of fear memory, generalization is mediated by the coordinated actions of prefrontal, hippocampal, amygdalar, and thalamic brain areas. In this review article, we describe the current understanding of the behavioral, neural, genetic, and biochemical mechanisms involved in the generalization of fear. Fear generalization is a hallmark of many anxiety and stress-related disorders, and its emergence, severity, and manifestation are sex-dependent. Therefore, to improve the dialog between human and animal studies as well as to accelerate the development of effective therapeutics, we emphasize the need to examine both sex differences and remote timescales in rodent models.","[Asok, Arun; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Asok, Arun; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, HHMI, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA",,"Kandel, ER; Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Kandel, ER; Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Kandel, ER (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, HHMI, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Kandel, ER (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA.",erk5@columbia.edu; jbr2114@columbia.edu,,"Rayman, Joseph/0000-0003-0149-0024",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1F32-MH114306]; Cohen Veterans Bioscience; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH114306] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We are grateful for the support from the National Institute of Mental Health 1F32-MH114306 (AA), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (EK) and Cohen Veterans Bioscience (JR and EK).",,210,46,46,9,27,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

However, its role in the regulation of fear responses appears more complex, brain site-specific, sex-specific, and dependent on a prior stress history. Studies have shown that OT neurons in the hypothalamus are activated during cued and contextual fear conditioning and during fear recall, highlighting the recruitment of endogenous oxytocin system in fear learning. OT is released into the extended amygdala, which contains the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), both critical for the regulation of fear and anxiety-like behaviors. Behavioral studies report that OT in the CeA reduces contextual fear responses; whereas in the BNST, OT receptor (OTR) neurotransmission facilitates cued fear and reduces fear responses to un-signaled, diffuse threats. These ostensibly contrasting behavioral effects support growing evidence that OT works to promote fear discrimination by reducing contextual fear or fear of diffuse threats, yet strengthening fear responses to imminent and predictable threats. Recent studies from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) support this notion and show that activation of OTR in the BLA facilitates fear discrimination by increasing fear responses to discrete cues. Also, OTR transmission in the CeA has been shown to mediate a switch from passive freezing to active escape behaviors in confrontation with an imminent, yet escapable threat but reduce reactivity to distant threats. Therefore, OT appears to increase the salience of relevant threat-signaling cues yet reduce fear responses to un-signaled, distant, or diffuse threats. Lastly, OTR signaling has been shown to underlie emotional discrimination between conspecifics during time of distress, social transmission of fear, and social buffering of fear. As OT has been shown to enhance salience of both positive and negative social experiences, it can also serve as a warning system against potential threats in social networks. Here, we extend the social salience hypothesis by proposing that OT enhances the salience of relevant environmental cues also in non-social contexts, and as such promotes active defensive behaviors.","[Olivera-Pasilio, Valentina; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Ctr Neurobiol Stress Resilience & Psychiat Disord, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Olivera-Pasilio, Valentina; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Discipline Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Olivera-Pasilio, Valentina; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Sch Grad & Postdoctoral Studies, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA",,"Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Ctr Neurobiol Stress Resilience & Psychiat Disord, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.; Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Discipline Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.; Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Sch Grad & Postdoctoral Studies, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",joanna.dabrowska@rosalindfranklin.edu,,,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH113007, R01MH113007-04S1]; Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science","This work was supported by grant from the National Institute of Mental Health R01MH113007 and R01MH113007-04S1 to JD and start-up funds from the Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science to JD.",,100,8,8,3,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

Here, we examined the effect of a conditioned rat's fear memory retrieval on a naive cage-mate's behavior to the conditioned stimulus. We show that rats exposed to a novel tone in the presence of a cage-mate previously conditioned to that same tone selectively showed increased freezing to the stimulus the next day (fear conditioning by-proxy). In addition, fear conditioning by-proxy experienced prior to pairing the tone to a mild shock increased freezing during presentation of that tone the next day. Our results suggest that, during memory retrieval, fear of a stimulus can be socially transmitted to a cage-mate. These findings may have implications for models of phobias. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of the studies in humans do not link startle potentiation and neural activity during fear acquisition and extinction. Therefore, we examined startle blink responses measured with electromyography (EMG) and brain activity measured with functional MRI simultaneously during differential conditioning. Furthermore, we combined these behavioral fear indices with brain network activity by analyzing the brain activity evoked by the startle probe stimulus presented during conditioned visual threat and safety cues as well as in the absence of visual stimulation. In line with previous research, we found a fear-induced potentiation of the startle blink responses when elicited during a conditioned threat stimulus and a rapid decline of amygdala activity after an initial differentiation of threat and safety cues in early acquisition trials. Increased activation during processing of threat cues was also found in the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). More importantly, our results depict an increase of brain activity to probes presented during threatening in comparison to safety cues indicating an involvement of the anterior insula, the ACC, the thalamus, and the PAG in fear-potentiated startle processing during early extinction trials. Our study underlines that parallel assessment of fear-potentiated startle in fMRI paradigms can provide a helpful method to investigate common and distinct processing pathways in humans and animals and, thus, contributes to translational research.

Discrimination trainings are promising approaches for reducing such fear over-generalization. Here we investigated the efficacy of a fear-relevant vs. a fear-irrelevant discrimination training on fear generalization and whether the effects are increased with feedback during training. Eighty participants underwent two fear acquisition blocks, during which one face (conditioned stimulus, CS+), but not another face (CS-), was associated with a female scream (unconditioned stimulus, US). During two generalization blocks, both CSs plus four morphs (generalization stimuli, GS1-GS4) were presented. Between these generalization blocks, half of the participants underwent a fear-relevant discrimination training (discrimination between CS+ and the other faces) with or without feedback and the other half a fear-irrelevant discrimination training (discrimination between the width of lines) with or without feedback. US expectancy, arousal, valence ratings, and skin conductance responses (SCR) indicated successful fear acquisition. Importantly, fear-relevant vs. fear-irrelevant discrimination trainings and feedback vs. no feedback reduced generalization as reflected in US expectancy ratings independently from one another. No effects of training condition were found for arousal and valence ratings or SCR. In summary, this is a first indication that fear-relevant discrimination training and feedback can improve the discrimination between threat and safety signals in healthy individuals, at least for learning-related evaluations, but not evaluations of valence or (physiological) arousal.","[Herzog, Katharina; Andreatta, Marta; Schneider, Kristina; Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany; [Andreatta, Marta] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ Sci & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Schiele, Miriam A.; Domschke, Katharina] Univ Freiburg, Fac Med, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Freiburg, Germany; [Romanos, Marcel] Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychosomat & Ps, Wurzburg, Germany; [Deckert, Juergen] Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Psychiat Psychosomat & Psychotherapy, Wurzburg, Germany",,"Pauli, P (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany.",pauli@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Romanos, Marcel/D-7695-2017; Andreatta, Marta/Y-6551-2019","Romanos, Marcel/0000-0001-7628-8299; Andreatta, Marta/0000-0002-1217-8266; Schiele, Miriam/0000-0003-2613-6515","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [44541416-TRR 58]; University of Wurzburg","The work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)-project no. 44541416-TRR 58 Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders within project Z02 to PP, JD, MR, and KD.

In this model, an organism is trained to predict an aversive unconditioned stimulus from initially neutral events (conditioned stimuli, CS). In humans, fear memory is typically measured via conditioned autonomic responses or fear-potentiated startle. For the latter, various analysis approaches have been developed, but a systematic comparison of competing methodologies is lacking. Here, we investigate the suitability of a model-based approach to startle eyeblink analysis for assessment of fear memory, and compare this to extant analysis strategies. First, we build a psychophysiological model (PsPM) on a generic startle response. Then, we optimize and validate this PsPM on three independent fear-conditioning data sets. We demonstrate that our model can robustly distinguish aversive (CS+) from nonaversive stimuli (CS-, i.e., has high predictive validity). Importantly, our model-based approach captures fear-potentiated startle during fear retention as well as fear acquisition. Our results establish a PsPM-based approach to assessment of fear-potentiated startle, and qualify previous peak-scoring methods. Our proposed model represents a generic startle response and can potentially be used beyond fear conditioning, for example, to quantify affective startle modulation or prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response.","[Khemka, Saurabh; Tzovara, Athina; Gerster, Samuel; Quednow, Boris B.; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Khemka, Saurabh; Tzovara, Athina; Quednow, Boris B.; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tzovara, Athina; Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England",,"Bach, DR (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Hosp Psychiat, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",dominik.bach@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik R/B-4302-2019; Quednow, Boris B./A-1666-2008","Bach, Dominik R/0000-0003-3717-2036; Quednow, Boris B./0000-0001-7933-2865; Tzovara, Athina/0000-0002-7588-1418; Gerster, Samuel/0000-0001-6507-739X",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [320030_1449586/ 1]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [091593/Z/10/Z],We thank Mahnoor Anwar for assistance in data collection.

This study discusses sex-specific aspects of the recognition of the facial expression of fear using results from our previously published experimental study. We conducted an experiment in which 201 participants judged seven different facial expressions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise (Trnka et al. 2007). Participants were able to recognize the facial expression of fear significantly better on a male face than on a female face. Females also recognized fear generally better than males. The present study provides a new interpretation of this sex difference in the recognition of fear. We interpret these results within the paradigm of human ethology, taking into account the adaptive function of the facial expression of fear. We argue that better detection of fear might be crucial for females under a situation of serious danger in groups of early hominids. The crucial role of females in nurturing and protecting offspring was fundamental for the reproductive potential of the group. A clear decoding of this alarm signal might thus have enabled the timely preparation of females for escape or defence to protect their health for successful reproduction. Further, it is likely that males played the role of guardians of social groups and that they were responsible for effective warnings of the group under situations of serious danger. This may explain why the facial expression of fear is better recognizable on the male face than on the female face.","[Trnka, Radek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Prague, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Radek; Tavel, Peter] Prague Coll Psychosocial Studies, Prague 10900 10, Czech Republic; [Tavel, Peter; Hasto, Jozef] Palacky Univ, OUSHI, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Tavel, Peter] Safarik Univ, Fac Med, Inst Publ Hlth, Hlth Psychol Unit, Kosice, Slovakia; [Hasto, Jozef] Psychiat Clin, Trencin, Slovakia; [Hasto, Jozef] St Elisabeth Univ Hlth & Social Sci, Bratislava, Slovakia",,"Trnka, R (corresponding author), Prague Coll Psychosocial Studies, Sci & Res Dept, Milanska 471, Prague 10900 10, Czech Republic.",trnkar@volny.cz,"Tavel, Peter/AAG-9216-2020; Trnka, Radek/S-7776-2017","Trnka, Radek/0000-0003-3731-468X; Tavel, Peter/0000-0001-7072-001X",Zdenek Klein Award; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic via the project Spirituality and Health among Adolescents and Adults in the Czech Republic [GA 15-19968S],This work was supported by the Zdenek Klein Award 2007 and the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic via the project Spirituality and Health among Adolescents and Adults in the Czech Republic (GA 15-19968S).,,48,3,3,1,30,MAGHIRA & MAAS PUBLICATIONS,STOCKHOLM,"PO BOX 26132, S-100 41 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN",0172-780X,,,NEUROENDOCRINOL LETT,Neuroendocrinol.

Immigration documentation status and its contribution to fears are important barriers to accessing health services including HIV testing. A currently changing political climate within the United States may have increased the complexity of the intersection of documentation status and health care access. This study used an anonymous survey conducted in March and April 2017 in New York City to compare: sociodemographic characteristics, HIV testing behaviors, HIV risk behaviors, and perceptions of fear around HIV testing among documented and undocumented Latino immigrants (N=301). We found that undocumented immigrants reported lower levels of education, income, and health insurance than did documented immigrants. However, groups did not differ in having tested for HIV in the last 12months, in future intentions to test for HIV, or in emotional/cognitive perceptions of fear around HIV testing. Undocumented immigrants reported lower rates of having ever tested for HIV in their lifetime (68.6%) than documented immigrants (80.5%) (p=0.027). In conclusion, we found that despite sociodemographic challenges, undocumented immigrants had similar HIV testing behaviors as their documented counterparts in our study community. Further understanding of the mitigating factors that resulted in seemingly equal access to HIV testing in this community for undocumented immigrants is warranted. ResumenLos inmigrantes Latinos tienen un mayor riesgo de contraer el VIH y de tener retraso con el diagnostico en los Estados Unidos. El estatus de documentacion de inmigracion y su contribucion al miedo son obstaculos importantes al acceso a los servicios de salud como la prueba de VIH. El clima politico esta cambiando actualmente in los estados unidos, lo cual se haya aumentado la complejidad de la interseccion del estatus de documentacion y el acceso a la asistencia sanitaria. Este estudio utilizo una encuesta anonima realizado en marzo y abril de 2017 en la Ciudad de Nueva York para comparar las caracteristicas sociodemograficas, los comportamientos de pruebas del VIH, los comportamientos de riesgo, y el miedo de la prueba de VIH entre los inmigrantes Latinos documentados y los indocumentados (N=301). Encontramos que los inmigrantes indocumentados reportaron niveles mas bajos de educacion, ingresos, y seguro medico que los inmigrantes documentados. Sin embargo, no hubo diferencias significativas entre los grupos en haberse hecho la prueba del VIH en los ultimos 12 meses, en intenciones futuras de hacerse la prueba de VIH, o en la evaluacion del miedo cognitivo/emocional acerca de la prueba de VIH. Los inmigrantes indocumentados reportaron tasas mas bajas de alguna vez haberse hecho la prueba del VIH (68.6%) que los inmigrantes documentados (80.5%) (p=0.027). En conclusion, encontramos que, a pesar de las dificultades sociodemograficas, los inmigrantes indocumentados tenian comportamientos similares de hacerse la prueba de VIH que sus contrapartes documentadas en nuestra comunidad en estudio. Es, por tanto, necesario que tengamos una mejor comprension de los factores atenuantes que contribuyen al acceso a la prueba de VIH que parece igual para inmigrantes indocumentados en esta comunidad.","[Lee, Jane J.] Univ Washington, Sch Social Work, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Yu, Gary] Ctr Drug Use & HIV HCV Res CDUHR, New York, NY USA; [Yu, Gary] NYU, Rory Meyers Coll Nursing, New York, NY USA",,"Lee, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Social Work, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",janejlee@uw.edu,"Lee, Jane/AAC-9133-2022","Lee, Jane/0000-0002-7047-9315",National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R36MH108395]; Center for Latino Adolescent and Family Health at New York University Silver School of Social Work; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R36MH108395] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,The study was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R36MH108395.

A novel perceptual discrimination training task was therefore designed to moderate fear over generalization. We hypothesized that improvement in basic perceptual discrimination would translate into lower fear overgeneralization in affective cues. Seventy adults completed a fear-conditioning task prior to being allocated into training or placebo groups. Predesignated geometric shape pairs were constructed for the training task. A target shape from each pair was presented. Thereafter, participants in the training group were shown both shapes and asked to identify the image that differed from the target. Placebo task participants only indicated the location of each shape on the screen. All participants then viewed new geometric pairs and indicated whether they were identical or different. Finally, participants completed a fear generalization test consisting of perceptual morphs ranging from the CS + to the CS-. Fear-conditioning was observed through physiological and behavioural measures. Furthermore, the training group performed better than the placebo group on the assessment task and exhibited decreased fear generalization in response to threat/safety cues.

However, preventing the return of fear is still a major challenge after this behavioral treatment. An increasing number of studies suggest that high-dose glucocorticoid treatment immediately after trauma can alleviate the symptoms of PTSD in humans. Unknown is whether high-dose glucocorticoid treatment following fear conditioning suppresses the return of fear. In the present study, a typical fear renewal paradigm (AAB) was used, in which the fear response to an auditory cue can be restored in a novel context (context B) when both training and extinction occur in the same context (context A). We trained rats for auditory fear conditioning and administered corticosterone (CORT; 5 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle with different delays (1 and 24 h). Forty-eight hours after drug injection, extinction was conducted with no drug in the training context, followed by a test of tone-induced freezing behavior in the same (AAA) or a shifted (AAB) context. Both immediate and delayed administration of high-dose CORT after fear conditioning reduced fear renewal. To examine the anxiolytic effect of CORT, independent rats were trained for cued or contextual fear conditioning, followed by an injection of CORT (5 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle at a 1 or 24 h delay. One week later, anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) before and after fear expression. We found that high-dose CORT decreased anxiety-like behavior without changing tone- or context-induced freezing. These findings indicate that a single high-dose CORT administration given after fear conditioning may selectively suppress fear renewal by reducing anxiety-like behavior and not by altering the consolidation, retrieval, or extinction of fear memory.

Some of this effect occurs because the animals become afraid, either of people in general, or of specific individuals as a result of aversive handling. In this paper, we review a number of studies showing that farm animals handled roughly or aversively learn to associate the handling with people, and that this learned fear of people can have marked effects on production. The ability to recognize individual people has now been shown indisputably for many species of farm animals, although under some circumstances, animals do not behave differently to different people. Animals' learned fear of individual people can markedly affect their productivity. For example, in dairy cattle, the presence of an aversive handler during milking can reduce milk yield and substantially increase residual milk. Pigs appear to use multiple cues to distinguish people, although visual cues are clearly important. Cows can readily learn to distinguish between people wearing different colour clothes, but it is more difficult for them to distinguish between people wearing the same colour. Furthermore, cows' responses to people change markedly when clothing colour is changed, although this does not seem to be true for poultry. However, animals' responses to people can be affected by the context. For example, cattle's learned responses to individuals can be strongly affected by the place they are in. We finish with some suggestions as to how these results can be used to reduce fear in farm animals. Crown copyright (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Like sustenance, danger is biologically relevant, and neutral cues can take on great salience when they predict a threat to survival. In anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this type of conditioned fear fails to extinguish, and reminders of traumatic events can cause pathological conditioned fear responses for decades after danger has passed. In this review, we use fear conditioning and extinction studies to draw a direct line from Pavlov to PTSD and other anxiety disorders. We explain how rodent studies have informed neuroimaging studies of healthy humans and humans with PTSD. We describe several genes that have been linked to both PTSD and fear conditioning and extinction and explain how abnormalities in fear conditioning or extinction may reflect a general biomarker of anxiety disorders. Finally, we explore drug and neuromodulation treatments that may enhance therapeutic extinction in anxiety disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To date the effects of acute stress on extinction learning in humans are not well understood. Models of stress effects on emotional memory suggest that learning during the so-called first wave of the stress response will be enhanced. The first wave includes (among others) increases of noradrenaline in the brain and increased sympathetic tone, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the periphery while the second wave includes genomic glucocorticoid-actions. The cold pressor test (CPT) is a valid way to induce the first wave of the stress response. We thus hypothesized that the CPT will facilitate extinction. In a 2-day fear-conditioning procedure with 40 healthy men, using differential skin conductance responses as a measure of conditioned fear, we placed the CPT versus a control procedure prior to extinction training on Day 1. We tested for extinction learning on Day 1 and extinction retrieval on Day 2. During extinction training (Day 1) only the CPT-group showed a significant reduction in differential responding. This was still evident on Day 2, where the CPT group had less differential responding during early trials (retrieval) and a higher extinction retention index. This is the first human study to show that a simple procedure, triggering the first-wave stress response the CPT can effectively enhance fear extinction in humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Competition between these two responses often results in a return of fear, limiting control over anxiety. However, one hypothesis holds that a pharmacologic strategy aimed at reducing amygdala activity while simultaneously augmenting medial prefrontal cortex function could facilitate the extinction of conditioned fear. METHODS: Key among the endogenous inhibitors of amygdala activity in response to social fear signals is the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin. To address the question whether oxytocin can strengthen Pavlovian extinction beyond its role in controlling social fear, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with 62 healthy male participants in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design. Specifically, subjects were exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm before receiving an intranasal dose (24 IU) of synthetic oxytocin or placebo. RESULTS: Oxytocin, when administered intranasally after Pavlovian fear conditioning, was found to increase electrodermal responses and prefrontal cortex signals to conditioned fear in the early phase of extinction and to enhance the decline of skin conductance responses in the late phase of extinction. Oxytocin also evoked an unspecific inhibition of amygdalar responses in both phases. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings identify oxytocin as a differentially acting modulator of neural hubs involved in Pavlovian extinction. This specific profile of oxytocin action may open up new avenues for enhancing extinction-based therapies for anxiety disorders.","[Eckstein, Monika; Becker, Benjamin; Scheele, Dirk; Scholz, Claudia; Preckel, Katrin; Schlaepfer, Thomas E.; Maier, Wolfgang; Hurlemann, Rene] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychiat, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Eckstein, Monika; Becker, Benjamin; Scheele, Dirk; Scholz, Claudia; Preckel, Katrin; Hurlemann, Rene] Univ Bonn, Div Med Psychol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Schlaepfer, Thomas E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychiat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Schlaepfer, Thomas E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mental Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Grinevich, Valery] German Canc Res Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany; [Kendrick, Keith M.] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Key Lab Neuroinformat, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Maier, Wolfgang] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, Bonn, Germany",,"Hurlemann, R (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Psychiat, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.",renehurlemann@icloud.com,"Preckel, Katrin/O-5169-2019; Becker, Benjamin/W-4971-2017; Hurlemann, Rene/AAL-5515-2020; Scheele, Dirk/K-1194-2015; Hurlemann, Rene/G-4164-2012","Preckel, Katrin/0000-0003-1498-3813; Becker, Benjamin/0000-0002-9014-9671; Hurlemann, Rene/0000-0003-2628-565X; Scheele, Dirk/0000-0002-7613-0376; Hurlemann, Rene/0000-0003-2628-565X; Eckstein, Monika/0000-0002-1846-4992; Schlaepfer, Thomas/0000-0003-0612-9692; Grinevich, Valery/0000-0002-6337-8866","Starting Independent Researcher Grant (Neuromodulation of Emotion research group); Ministry of Innovation, Science, Research & Technology of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia [91132720]; University of Bonn [91132720]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91132720]","This work was supported by a Starting Independent Researcher Grant (Neuromodulation of Emotion research group) jointly provided by the Ministry of Innovation, Science, Research & Technology of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the University of Bonn (RH) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No. 91132720 (KMK).",,75,122,129,2,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Animal research suggests that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a key role in the maintenance of extinguished fear. Here, we combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the role of GABA in fear recovery in 70 healthy male participants. We associated baseline GABA levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) to indices of fear recovery as defined by changes in skin conductance responses (SCRs), blood oxygen level dependent responses, and functional connectivity from fear extinction to fear retrieval. The results showed that high GABA levels were associated with increased SCRs, enhanced activation of the right amygdala, and reduced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity during fear recovery. Follow-up analyses exclusively for the extinction phase showed that high GABA levels were associated with reduced amygdala activation and enhanced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity, despite the absence of correlations between GABA and physiological responses. Follow-up analyses for the retrieval phase did not show any significant associations with GABA. Together, the association between GABA and increases in SCRs from extinction to retrieval, without associations during both phases separately, suggests that dACC GABA primarily inhibits the consolidation of fear extinction. In addition, the opposite effects of GABA on amygdala activity and connectivity during fear extinction compared to fear recovery suggest that dACC GABA may initially facilitate extinction learning.","[Levar, Nina; van Leeuwen, Judith M.

Generally, the idea is that by virtue of the formation of associations or acquired propositional knowledge about the relation between neutral movements and pain, these movements may signal pain, and hence start to elicit defensive fear responses (eg, avoidance behavior). This assumption has never been investigated experimentally. Therefore, we developed a pain-relevant fear conditioning paradigm using a movement as a conditioned stimulus (CS) and a painful electrocutaneous stimulus as an unconditioned stimulus (US) to examine the acquisition of fear of movement-related pain in healthy subjects. In a within-subjects design, participants manipulated a joystick to the left/right in the experimental (predictable) condition, and upward/downward in the control (unpredictable) condition or vice versa. In the predictable condition, one movement direction (CS+), and not the other (CS-), was followed by painful stimuli. In the unpredictable condition, painful stimuli were always delivered during the inter-trial interval. Both fear of movement-related pain ratings and eyeblink startle measures were more elevated in response to the CS+ than to the CS-, whereas no differences occurred between both unreinforced CSs in the control condition. Participants were slower initiating a CS+ movement than a CS- movement, while response latencies to CSs in the control condition did not differ. These data support the acquisition of fear of movement-related pain by associative learning. Results are discussed in the broader context of the acquisition of pain-related fear in patients with musculoskeletal pain. (C) 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Bronx County, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred eighty participants without FOF at baseline in the Einstein Aging Study aged 70 and older. MEASUREMENTS: FOF was assessed at baseline and during follow-up interviews at 2- to 3-month intervals for a minimum 2 years. Incident FOF was classified as transient or persistent FOF. Transient FOF was defined as new-onset FOF reported at only one interview, and persistent FOF was FOF reported at two or more interviews over a 2-year period. RESULTS: Twenty-four-month cumulative incidence of incident FOF was 45.4%, with 60.0% of FOF being persistent. Predictors of incident FOF included female sex (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-2.23), depressive symptoms (aHR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07-1.26), falls (aHR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.01-2.21), and clinical gait abnormality (aHR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.42-3.01). The proportion of participants with incident FOF increased linearly with increasing number of risk factors. Predictors for transient and persistent FOF were depressive symptoms and clinical gait abnormality. Female sex and previous falls were predictors of persistent but not transient FOF. CONCLUSION: FOF status in older adults may change over time, with shared and distinct risk factors for persistent and transient FOF. Understanding the dynamic nature of FOF and these risk factors will help identify high-risk groups and design future intervention studies.

For centuries, the goal has been to kill sharks that come near boats or beaches. Yet, there is a growing trend of more positive feelings toward local shark populations. In this article, we demonstrate that feelings of pride toward sharks can serve as an opposing force to fear, and can moderate the way fear affects support for policies to kill sharks. This study reports on two surveys of pride toward sharks from Eastern and Western Australia. These highlight a new and emerging story for people and sharks. We argue that the combination of shifts in the understanding of sharks' motives during human-shark interactions and higher levels of pride support a new political dynamic in which the public prefers nonlethal responses to shark bites in support of a burgeoning save the sharks movement.","[Pepin-Neff, Christopher; Wynter, Thomas] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Pepin-Neff, C (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Social Sci Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",christopher.neff@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,20,8,8,4,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1087-1209,1533-158X,,HUM DIMENS WILDL,Hum.

Women who had been regularly exposure to cervical cancer messages were also three times more likely to perceive a moderate risk and seven times more likely to perceive a large risk of being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Conclusion: These results suggest that television news may be an effective means for health education.","[Lemal, Marijke; Van den Bulck, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",,"Lemal, M (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Sch Mass Commun Res, Parkstr 45,Box 3603, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",marijke.lemal@soc.kuleuven.be,"Van den Bulck, Jan/O-3168-2019; Van den Bulck, Jan/F-8770-2010","Van den Bulck, Jan/0000-0003-0885-0854; Van den Bulck, Jan/0000-0003-0885-0854",The Fund for Scientific Research-FlandersFWO [G.0293.06],The Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (G.0293.06).,,25,13,13,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1101-1262,1464-360X,,EUR J PUBLIC HEALTH,Eur.

Fear can involve both acute and potential threats that can manifest in different behaviors and result from activity within different neural nodes and networks. Fear circuits have been studied extensively in animal models for several decades and in human neuroimaging research for almost 20 years. Therefore, the centrality of fear processing to PTSD lends the disorder to be more tractable to investigation at the level of brain and behavior, and provides several observable phenotypes that can be linked to PTSD symptoms. Moreover, psychophysiological metrics of fear conditioning offer tools that can be used to shift diagnostic paradigms in psychiatry toward neurobiologyconsistent with a Research Domain Criteria approach to PTSD. In general, mammalian fear processing can be divided into fear learning (or acquisition), during which an association develops between previously neutral stimuli and aversive outcomes, and fear extinction, in which the latter associations are suppressed by a new form of learning. This review describes translational research in both fear acquisition and extinction, along with their relevance to PTSD and PTSD treatment, focusing specifically on the empirical value and potential clinical utility of psychophysiological methods.","[Norrholm, Seth Davin; Jovanovic, Tanja] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Norrholm, Seth Davin] Atlanta VA Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line, Decatur, GA USA",,"Jovanovic, T (corresponding author), 49 Jesse Hill Jr Dr, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",tjovano@emory.edu,"Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022",,,,,155,33,35,1,23,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1067-3229,1465-7309,,HARVARD REV PSYCHIAT,Harv.

Here, we explored people's landscapes of fear by investigating their perceptions of spatio-temporal variation in the risk of encountering wildlife, and how those perceptions influence their movement. We conducted a participatory risk mapping exercise with people living in the buffer zones of two protected areas in central India, which provide habitat to tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and numerous crop-raiding herbivores. We then tracked people's movement using GPS devices and explored how their movement related to their risk maps. Results of integrated step selection functions show that perceived risk influenced the speed and directedness with which people move, mixed evidence that perceived risk influenced where people went (habitat selection), and variation in how individuals responded to risks from different species. Future research on how humans and wildlife adapt to each other should investigate (1) human behavioral responses to wildlife over longer periods of time, (2) how movement affects the spatial patterns of human-wildlife conflict, and (3) the cultural and cognitive dimensions of how risk and emotions influence people's movement decisions.","[Read, Daniel J.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Habib, Bilal] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Stabach, Jared; Leimgruber, Peter] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Natl Zool Pk, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA",,"Read, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.",dread@umces.edu,"Leimgruber, Peter/O-1304-2015","Leimgruber, Peter/0000-0002-3682-0153; Read, Daniel/0000-0001-6768-2753; Stabach, Jared/0000-0002-7896-1237",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [201516684]; US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Internship Program,"This work was supported by a US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (Fellow ID: 201516684), and the US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Internship Program.",,88,0,0,7,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

In this regard, it has been shown that stress affects aversive learning and memory processes. In rodents, stress exposure 10 days prior to fear acquisition impairs fear extinction. However, in humans the effect of distal stress on fear conditioning is sparse. Therefore, we examined the influence of distal stress on fear memory in humans in two studies. In Study 1, participants underwent either socially evaluated cold-pressor test (SECPT) or sham procedure 10 days or 40 min before a fear conditioning paradigm (four groups, N = 78). In Study 2, context effects were examined by conducting SECPT and sham procedures 10 days prior conditioning either in the later fear conditioning context or in another context (three groups, N = 69). During acquisition phase, one geometrical shape (conditioned stimulus, CS +) was paired with painful electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US), but never a second shape (CS -). Extinction phase was identical to acquisition, but without US delivery. Importantly, for Study 1 these phases were conducted on one day, while for Study 2 on two separated days. Successful fear acquisition was indicated by aversive ratings and startle potentiation to CS + versus CS - in both studies. Interestingly, participants stressed 10 days earlier showed impaired extinction on the implicit level (startle potentiation to CS + vs. CS -) in Study 1 and only in the acquisition context on the explicit level (aversive ratings for CS + vs. CS -) in Study 2. In sum, distal stress may strengthen later acquired fear memories and thereby impair fear extinction. This finding could have clinical implications, showing that prior stress exposure sensitizes later aversive processing and impairs therapy.","[Klinke, Christopher M.; Andreatta, Marta] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Wurzburg, Germany; [Fiedler, Dominik; Lange, Maren D.] Univ Munster, Inst Physiol, Munster, Germany; [Andreatta, Marta] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ Sci & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Andreatta, M (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",marta.andreatta@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Andreatta, Marta/Y-6551-2019","Andreatta, Marta/0000-0002-1217-8266","German Research Foundation (DFG): Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety DisordersGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB-TRR 58]","The present work was funded and supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG): Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, SFB-TRR 58 project B08.

This study aimed to determine whether emotional learning affects semantic representations of words independent of perceptual features by assessing whether fear conditioning to a neutral word generalises across languages in bilingual participants. Two sessions differing according to the reinforced language were performed by English-Spanish bilinguals. In each session, a neutral word was reinforced by an electrical shock whereas its equivalent in the other language was never paired with shock. Across two sessions within our sample, we found replicable evidence that fear conditioning consistently transferred to the non-reinforced language as measured by both self-reported fear and electrodermal activity, irrespective of the conditioned language. Our findings extend knowledge about the role of semantic similarity in fear generalisation and highlight the importance of higher-order cognitive processes in human emotions.","[Gregoire, Laurent; Greening, Steven G.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, CNAPs Lab, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,"Gregoire, L (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, CNAPs Lab, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",lgregoire1@lsu.edu; sgreening@lsu.edu,,"Gregoire, Laurent/0000-0002-3519-6395; Greening, Steven/0000-0003-4578-4139",Louisiana Board of Regents [LEQSF(2016-19)-RD-A-05],This work was supported by Louisiana Board of Regents: [Grant Number LEQSF(2016-19)-RD-A-05].,,26,13,13,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Reinstatement protocols involve unexpected (re)-presentations of the unconditioned stimulus (USs) after fear extinction training. Here, we address the number of reinstatement USs administered as a potential boundary condition that may explain divergent findings in the field. A sample of 171 participants is exposed to a fear acquisition training, immediate extinction training, and reinstatement test experiment. Three groups differing in the number of reinstatement US are employed: one (n = 57) or four (n = 55) in experimental groups and zero (n = 59) in the control group. We adopt Bayesian statistical approaches beyond classical null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to qualify evidence for or against this potential methodological boundary condition in reinstatement-induced return of fear. Startle potentiation to the reinstatement administration context was increased for the RI-USone compared to the RI-USzero group, supporting the role of context conditioning in reinstatement. This effect was weaker in the RI-USfour group. This, however, did not transfer to responding to conditioned stimuli during the return of fear-test: no evidence for an effect of the number of reinstatement USs (zero, one, four) was observed in behavioral or physiological measures. In sum, our results speak against the number of reinstatement USs as a potential boundary condition in experimentally induced return of fear in humans. This may challenge what we think we know about the reinstatement phenomenon in humans and call for critical reconsideration of paradigms as well as mechanisms that may underlie some reinstatement effects in the literature.","[Sjouwerman, Rachel; Lonsdorf, Tina B.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany",,"Lonsdorf, TB (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",t.lonsdorf@uke.de,,"Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [1980/2-1],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: 1980/2-1",,48,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,MAY,2020,57,5,,,,,,,e13549,10.1111/psyp.13549,,FEB 2020,15,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,LE7IY,WOS:000514178200001,32072648,hybrid,,,2022-04-16,

Recently, P50 suppression deficits were observed in patients with anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as we previously reported. The processes of fear conditioning are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. In addition, we found that the P50 sensory gating mechanism might be physiologically associated with fear conditioning and extinction in a simple human fear-conditioning paradigm that involved a light signal as a conditioned stimulus (CS+). Our objective was to investigate the different patterns of P50 suppression in a discrimination fear-conditioning paradigm with both a CS+ (danger signal) and a CS- (safety signal). Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited. We measured the auditory P50 suppression in the control (baseline) phase, in the fear-acquisition phase, and in the fear-extinction phase using a discrimination fear-conditioning paradigm. Two-way (CSs vs. phase) Analysis of variance with repeated measures demonstrated a significant interaction between the two factors. Post-hoc LSD analysis indicated that the P50 S2/S1 ratio in the CS+ acquisition phase was significantly higher than that in the CS- acquisition phase. These results suggest that the auditory P50 sensory gating might differ according to the cognition of the properties (potentially dangerous or safe) of the perceived signal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Large predators and mesopredators usually produce this fear in animals. This effect is recognised in the form of various behavioural changes and adaptations, which, in turn, affects the whole ecosystem. However, we often overlook the role of large predators and mesopredators in the sustenance of our ecosystem by such non-lethal effects, because fear is often seen as a psychological effect rather than something that can be found through explicit scientific means. Indeed, the fear that predators trigger inside their prey may play a significant role in the maintenance of the natural environment. This paper aims to analyse this hypothesis by reviewing the function of the ecology of fear based on the interaction among predators, prey, and mesopredators. We consider the factors involved in the effective functionality of the ecology of fear, including habitat landscape, season, weather, and predation risk. We also assess the extent of influence of large predators on behaviour and distribution of prey and mesopredators in terms of predation cues and prey grouping as responses to predation risk. Finally, we discuss the implications of fear ecology for wildlife conservation and management and new challenges.","[Mpemba, H.; Yang, F.; Jiang, G.] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, G (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",jgshun@126.com,,"Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017PZ14]; National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC 31872241, 31572285]","We thank our colleagues in the Feline Research Center of National Foretry and Grassland Administration, College of Wildlife and Protected Areas, Northeast Forestry University for their appreciated suggestions during the preparation of this work.

Healthy adolescents (mean age 16.26) and adults (mean age 29.85) completed a fear learning paradigm across two stages during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Stage 1 involved conditioning and extinction, and stage 2 involved extinction recall, re-conditioning, followed by re-extinction. During extinction recall, we observed a higher skin conductance response to the CS+ relative to CS-in adolescents compared to adults, which was accompanied by a reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity. Relative to adults, adolescents also had significantly reduced activation in the ventromedial PFC, dlPFC, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during extinction recall compared to late extinction. Age differences in PCC activation between late extinction and late conditioning were also observed. These results show for the first time that healthy adolescent humans show different behavioral responses, and dampened PFC activity during short-term extinction recall compared to healthy adults. We also identify the PCC and TPJ as novel regions that may be associated with impaired extinction in adolescents. Also, while adults showed significant correlations between differential SCR and BOLD activity in some brain regions during late extinction and recall, adolescents did not show any significant correlations. This study highlights adolescent-specific neural correlates of extinction, which may explain the peak in prevalence of anxiety disorders during adolescence.","[Ganella, Despina E.; Drummond, Katherine D.; Kim, Jee Hyun] Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Behav Neurosci Div, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Ganella, Despina E.; Drummond, Katherine D.; Kim, Jee Hyun] Univ Melbourne, Florey Dept Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Ganella, Eleni P.; Whittle, Sarah] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Neuropsychiat Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Ganella, Eleni P.; Whittle, Sarah] Melbourne Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Kim, JH (corresponding author), Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Behav Neurosci Div, Parkville, Vic, Australia.; Kim, JH (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Florey Dept Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",drjeehyunkim@gmail.com,"; Kim, Jee Hyun/F-8777-2012; Whittle, Sarah/I-2200-2014","Drummond, Katherine Dawn/0000-0002-6534-7676; Kim, Jee Hyun/0000-0002-1299-4300; Whittle, Sarah/0000-0003-3145-1528",Baker Foundation Fellowship; University of MelbourneUniversity of Melbourne [603406]; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [APP1125504]; NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [APP1083309],"This work was supported by a Baker Foundation Fellowship and The University of Melbourne Early Career Researcher (ECR) grant (603406) awarded to DG, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Career Development Fellowship (APP1125504) awarded to SW, and NHMRC Career Development Fellowship (APP1083309) awarded to JK.

Heidegger interprets the former as the world-oriented worldly fear, and the latter selfly fear which directs toward the self. The concept of servile fear and that of fear are separately used by them as signifying the unauthentic way of experiencing the world as home, while anxiety and clean fear are referred to as revealing the possibility of an authentic potentiality-of-being.

This study examined the effects of feature learning on the acquisition and extinction of fear conditioning. Human participants were fear conditioned to a yellow triangle (CS+) using an electrical shock. We manipulated feature learning through differential conditioning. The nonconditioned control stimulus (CS-) was a red triangle in one group (Color-Relevant), but a yellow circle in the other group (Shape-Relevant). Next, two generalization stimuli were tested that shared the shape- or color-feature with the CS+ (a blue triangle and a yellow square). Online shock-expectancy ratings and skin conductance responding showed that the CS- determined the pattern of fear generalization: the same-color stimulus elicited more fear in Group Color-Relevant, versus the same-shape stimulus in group Shape-Relevant. Furthermore, extinguishing these two generalization stimuli had no detectable effect on fear of the CS+. These results show that fear generalization is influenced by feature learning through differential conditioning, and that exposures to different features of a stimulus are not sufficient to extinguish fear of that stimulus as a whole.

Studies in humans and animals indicate that predictable and unpredictable aversive events can induce phasic and sustained fear, respectively. Research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear. We explored this issue in humans by examining threat predictability in three virtual reality contexts, one in which electric shocks were predictably signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks occurred unpredictably but never paired with a cue, and a third in which no shocks were delivered. Evidence of threat-induced phasic and sustained fear was presented using fear ratings and skin conductance. Utilizing recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we were able to conduct whole-brain fMRI at relatively high spatial resolution and still have enough sensitivity to detect transient and sustained signal changes in the basal forebrain. We found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala, but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex. Consistent with animal models hypothesizing a role for the cortex in generating sustained fear, sustained signal increases to unpredictable threat were also found in anterior insula and a frontoparietal cortical network associated with hypervigilance. In addition, unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses. In line with basic findings in rodents, these results provide evidence that phasic and sustained fear in humans may manifest similar signs of distress, but appear to be associated with different patterns of neural activity in the human basal forebrain.

Therefore, determining how caregivers regulate children's affective neurobiology is essential for understanding psychopathology etiology and prevention. Much of the research on affective functioning uses fear learning to map maturation trajectories, with both rodent and human studies contributing knowledge. Nonetheless, as no standard framework exists through which to interpret developmental effects across species, research often remains siloed, thus contributing to the current therapeutic impasse. Here, we propose a developmental ecology framework that attempts to understand fear in the ecological context of the child: their relationship with their parent. By referring to developmental goals that are shared across species (to attach to, then, ultimately, separate from the parent), this framework provides a common grounding from which fear systems and their dysfunction can be understood, thus advancing research on psychopathologies and their treatment.","[Callaghan, Bridget; Van Tieghem, Michelle; Harmon, Chelsea; Tottenham, Nim] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Callaghan, Bridget] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Meyer, Heidi; Li, Anfei; Lee, Francis S.] Weill Cornell Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Opendak, Maya; Sullivan, Regina M.] NYU, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Opendak, Maya; Sullivan, Regina M.] Nathan S Klein Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA",,"Callaghan, B (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Callaghan, B (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",blc2139@columbia.edu; hem2022@med.cornell.edu; maya.opendak@nyumc.org; mrv2115@columbia.edu; cmh2228@columbia.edu; anl2038@med.cornell.edu; fslee@med.cornell.edu; regina.sullivan@nyumc.org; nlt7@columbia.edu,,"Sullivan, Regina/0000-0002-2406-8857; Opendak, Maya/0000-0003-4334-3188","EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R37HD083217] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH091864, K99MH113821, F32MH112232, F31MH115686] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCATS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1 TR002384, TL1 TR002386] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R37 HD083217] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01 DC009910] Funding Source: Medline; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32 GM007739] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH091451, K99 MH113821, F32 MH112232, F31 MH115686, R01 MH091864] Funding Source: Medline",,,144,39,39,1,5,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1548-5943,,,ANNU REV CLIN PSYCHO,Annu.

Assessing the nature of these alterations to trophic interactions requires an understanding of how species' demography and behavior are altered by simultaneous, complex pressures. For predator-prey relationships, landscapes of fear have been used to measure the trade-off prey animals make between maximizing energy gain and minimizing risk of predation. However, hierarchical foraging theory predicts that the degree to which aggregations of resources are used will depend upon the context in which they occur, not merely on the predation risk associated with those patches. We develop a conceptual framework that synthesizes theories of foraging hierarchies and landscapes of fear to show how predation risk and resource variation may interact to influence foraging behavior. We show, experimentally, that northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), do respond to the likely predation risk when making their foraging decisions; however, the food resources in the habitat surrounding the food patch also play a significant role in the degree to which food patches are used. This result has important implications for the accuracy of assessments of landscapes of fear and habitat use using observations of animal foraging behavior.","[Searle, Kate R.; Stokes, Chris J.; Gordon, Iain J.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Sustainable, Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia",,"Searle, KR (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Sustainable, Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia.",krsearle@nrel.colostate.edu,"Gordon, Iain/S-8076-2019; Stokes, Chris J/G-5199-2010; Stokes, Chris/AAR-2890-2021; Gordon, Iain J/K-8636-2012; Searle, Kate R/F-4922-2011","Gordon, Iain/0000-0001-9704-0946; Stokes, Chris J/0000-0003-1576-2457; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-1576-2457; Gordon, Iain J/0000-0001-9704-0946; Searle, Kate R/0000-0003-4624-9023",,,,47,38,40,5,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

The bulk of the data suggest that the amygdala can be activated from potentially accessible but unattended fear stimuli. Activation of the amygdala facilitates low level visual processing. Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of the amygdala is mediated by a subcortical pathway. Thus, according to data from patients with lesions in the primary visual cortex, the amygdala can be activated in the absence of cortical processing. There is considerable support for the hypothesis that visual stimuli can access the amygdala via a pathway that includes the superior colliculus and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. These data are consistent with an evolutionary argument, focusing of the role of snakes as a predator on primates. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Fast learning serves to minimize the number of threat confrontations, while specific learning ensures that the acquired fears are tied to threat-relevant cues only. In Pavlovian fear conditioning, fear acquisition is typically studied via repetitive pairings of a single cue with an aversive experience, which is not optimal for the examination of fast specific fear learning. In this study, we adopted the one-trial overshadowing procedure from basic learning research, in which a combination of two visual cues is presented once and paired with an aversive electrical stimulation. Using on-line shock expectancy ratings, skin conductance reactivity and startle reflex modulation as indices of fear learning, we found evidence of strong fear after a single conditioning trial (fast learning) as well as attenuated fear responding when only half of the trained stimulus combination was presented (specific learning). Moreover, specificity of fear responding tended to correlate with levels of state and trait anxiety. These results suggest that one-trial overshadowing can be used as a model to study fast specific fear learning in humans and individual differences therein. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the outcome of such environmental changes will depend on the resources provided. We provided either various physical items that posed no biosecurity risk and were inexpensive (such as balls, chains, a perch and rope) to alter behavioral time budgets and interactions with the environment or provided additional visual contact with humans (10 min daily) with the aim to reduce fearfulness. Additional human contact reduced fear of humans at 35 days of age, but did not affect general fearfulness. Increased environmental complexity via the provision of physical items reduced some indicators of fear at 21 days, but not at 35 days of age. A woodblock and perch were the most favored physical items, but chickens preferred to sit underneath the perch rather than on top. When pecking items were not provided, chickens redirected their pecking to the wood shaving litter. Overall, there was little evidence that our physical items improved the chickens' behavioral time budget, fear, physiological stress or production. The benefits of additional visual contact with humans should be investigated on larger groups to ensure that such effects are practical and effective to reduce fear of humans on farm. Increased environmental complexity can improve animal welfare, depending on the resources provided and use by the animal. We provided chickens either with physical items that posed no biosecurity risk and were inexpensive (balls, chains, perches and rope) (P; n = 36) or additional visual human contact (10 min daily) (HC; n = 36) compared to farm-like standard control groups (C; n = 36) with 3 pens per treatment. Additional human contact reduced fear of humans at 35 days of age, but not general fearfulness. P birds required more inductions to induce tonic immobility compared to HC and C birds at 21 days of age. However, other indicators of fear (open field test and plasma corticosterone concentration) did not significantly differ.

Heightened conditioned fear expression may be a prospective risk factor for the development of human anxiety and trauma disorders. However, the relationship between conditioned fear expression and FGF2 is yet to be established in humans. METHODS: Using a cross-species approach, we first investigated the relationship between serum concentrations of FGF2 and individual differences in conditioned fear expression in rats (n = 19). We then subjected 88 human participants, who were recruited from university and community advertisements, to a differential fear conditioning procedure and assessed the relationship between salivary concentrations of FGF2 and fear expression to a conditioned stimulus (CS) (a stimulus paired with a shock) and a CS that was never paired with shock. RESULTS: Rats with low serum levels of FGF2 exhibited significantly more freezing than rats with high serum levels of FGF2. Similarly, relative to those with high salivary FGF2, human participants with low salivary FGF2 exhibited significantly heightened skin conductance responses to the CS without shock during fear conditioning and to both the CS with shock and CS without shock during fear recall. CONCLUSIONS: These studies establish that peripheral markers of FGF2 concentrations are negatively associated with fear expression in both rats and humans. To the extent that conditioned fear expression predicts anxiety and trauma disorder vulnerability, FGF2 may be a clinically useful biomarker in the prediction and eventual prevention of these disorders.","[Graham, Bronwyn M.; Zagic, Dino; Richardson, Rick] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,"Graham, BM (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",bgraham@psy.unsw.edu.au,,"Graham, Bronwyn/0000-0001-6582-2273","Goldstar Award and a Silverstar Award, from the University of New South Wales; Discovery Early Career Research Award from the Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE140100243]","This work was supported by a Goldstar Award and a Silverstar Award, both from the University of New South Wales (to BMG and RR) and by a Discovery Early Career Research Award from the Australian Research Council (DE140100243) to BMG.

Skin conductance responses and subjective fear ratings were also assessed. During conditioning, healthy comparisons showed differential activation (CS+ > CS-) in regions of the fronto-amygdala circuitry. In comparison, the at-risk group showed greater activation to the safety cue (CS- > CS+) in the amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Furthermore, fear conditioning has been proposed as an endophenotype for genetic studies of anxiety disorders. Although prior studies have demonstrated that fear conditioning and self-report fears are heritable, no studies have determined whether they share a common genetic basis. Methods: We obtained fear conditioning data from 173 twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry who also provided self-report ratings of 16 common fears. With multivariate structural equation modeling, we analyzed factor-derived scores for the subjective fear ratings together with the electrophysiologic skin conductance responses during habituation, acquisition, and extinction to determine the extent of their genetic covariation. Results: Phenotypic correlations between experimental and self-report fear measures were modest and, counter-intuitively, negative (i.e., subjects who reported themselves as more fearful had smaller electrophysiologic responses). Best-fit models estimated a significant (negative) genetic correlation between them, although genetic factors underlying fear conditioning accounted for only 9% of individual differences in self-report fears. Conclusions: Experimentally derived fear conditioning measures share only a small portion of the genetic factors underlying individual differences in subjective fears, cautioning against relying too heavily on the former as an endophenotype for genetic studies of phobic disorders.","[Hettema, John M.; Neale, Michael C.; Kendler, Kenneth S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Virginia Inst Psychiat & Behav Genet, Dept Psychiat, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Annas, Peter; Fredrikson, Mats] Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Uppsala, Sweden",,"Hettema, JM (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Virginia Inst Psychiat & Behav Genet, Dept Psychiat, POB 980126, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.",jhettema@vcu.edu,"Neale, Michael C/B-1418-2008; Neale, Michael/AAD-5056-2020; Kendler, Kenneth/AAF-2876-2019",,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K08MH066277, R01MH065322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH065322, MH-65322, K08 MH066277, K08 MH066277-05, K08 MH66277] Funding Source: Medline",,,47,9,10,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Across species, acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction, but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied. In rats, chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drug-free state. Here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans. Participants were healthy chronic cannabis users (n = 20) and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use (n = 20) matched on age, sex, and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders. A 2-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response. Consistent with hypotheses, chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced within-session extinction of skin conductance response on Day 1 (d = 0.78), and between-session extinction on Day 2 (d = 0.76). Unexpectedly, cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning. Replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of cannabis abstinence. General Scientific Summary Fear extinction provides a laboratory model to examine abnormal responses to stress. This study suggests that adults who regularly use marijuana have less capacity to extinguish previously conditioned fear responses compared to nonusing adults.","[Papini, Santiago; Powers, Mark B.; Smits, Jasper A.

We examined the effects of total sleep deprivation on subsequent enhancement of aversive event memory, implicit fear recognition, and fear conditioning in healthy humans. Methods: Three different recognitions (explicit event, implicit emotion, and physiological response) were assessed in two groups of 14 healthy young volunteers (sleep control and sleep deprived) with aversive (motor vehicle accident films) and nonaversive episodic memory stimuli. Both groups were tested on Day 1 of the experiment and again on Days 3 and 10; the sleep-deprived group was totally deprived of initial nocturnal sleep after the first trial on Day 1. Results: Event recognition performances were similar in both groups throughout the study. Implicit fear recognition remained high for aversive stimuli, with generalization of implicit fear recognition occurring for nonaversive stimuli on Day 3 in the sleep control group. Physiological fear and generalized fear responses were observed for every episode, and delayed enhancement of physiological response was only observed for misidentified aversive episodes in the sleep control group on Day 3. However, in the sleep-deprived group, generalization of implicit fear recognition for nonaversive stimuli on Day 3 and all physiological and generalized fear responses on Days 3 and 10 were comprehensively extinguished. Conclusions: Clinically, trauma-exposed victims often experience acute insomnia, indicating that such insomnia might provide prophylactic benefits in reducing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder via extinction of the fear-magnifying effects of memory.","[Kuriyama, Kenichi; Soshi, Takahiro; Kim, Yoshiharu] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Adult Mental Hlth, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan",,"Kuriyama, K (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Adult Mental Hlth, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, 4-1-1 Ogawa Higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan.",kenichik@ncnp.go.jp,,"Soshi, Takahiro/0000-0003-1924-936X","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology CorporationJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)","This work was supported by a grant from Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Corporation.",,60,42,43,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Far less is known about the generalisation of avoidance, the behavioural component of fear. In two experiments, we evaluated how neuroticism, a known vulnerability factor for anxiety, modulates an array of fear responses, including avoidance tendencies, towards generalisation stimuli (GS). Participants underwent differential fear conditioning, in which one conditioned stimulus (CS+) was repeatedly paired with an aversive outcome (shock; unconditioned stimulus, US), whereas another was not (CS-). Fear generalisation was observed across measures in Experiment 1 (US expectancy and evaluative ratings) and Experiment 2 (US expectancy, evaluative ratings, skin conductance, startle responses, safety behaviours), with overall highest responding to the CS+, lowest to the CS- and intermediate responding to the GSs.

The current study assessed whether novelty-facilitated extinction can also prevent reinstatement, a second laboratory analogue of return of fear. Following differential fear conditioning, one group of participants underwent standard extinction training whereas the second was presented with a novel tone after the conditional stimulus that previously predicted the aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Three presentations of the USs alone reinstated differential electrodermal fear responses after standard extinction, but not after novelty-facilitated extinction. Moreover, replicating previous findings, the extent of return of fear was correlated with self-reported intolerance of uncertainty after standard extinction, but not after novelty-facilitated extinction.

Recently, consolidation and reconsolidation processes have been reported to affect fear memory stability and integrity. This study explored the impact of reconsolidation processes and genetic make-up on fear reacquisition by manipulating reconsolidation, using extinction performed outside or inside a reconsolidation interval. Reacquisition measured by skin conductance responses was stronger in individuals that extinguished outside (6 h) than inside (10 min) the reconsolidation interval. However, the effect was predominantly present in val/val homozygotes of the functional val158met polymorphism of the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme and in short-allele carriers of the serotonin-transporter length 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. These results demonstrate that reconsolidation of human fear memory is influenced by dopamine and serotonin-related genes.

A combination of behavioral and pharmacological interventions is used to ameliorate the behavioral signs associated with anxiety-related behaviors in dogs, but there continues to be need for effective interventions. The current study examined the effects of the nutraceutical ANXITANE (R) (L-Theanine) chewable tablets on fear of unfamiliar human beings. We first characterized clogs as anxious on the basis of the existence of a fear response to human beings in their home-pen. We then demonstrated that dogs characterized as anxious (N = 10) showed reduced interaction with an unknown human being as compared with normal controls (N = 7). The effect of an administration of ANXITANE tablets (N = 5) on these anxious Beagle dogs was compared with placebo (N = 5). Objective behavioral measures of anxiety were obtained using an open-field test, a human interaction test, and an actiwatch protocol that allowed monitoring of activity over 24-hours. The ANXITANE (R) tablets-treated dogs showed greater human interaction and approach than the placebo control group, and no side effects related to treatment, including motor stimulant or sedative effects, were seen. The current study suggests that ANXITANE (R) tablets are effective for reducing fearful behavior toward unfamiliar human beings in dogs and supports their use for treating anxiety-related behaviors.

Next, an instrumental conditioning phase taught avoidance in the presence the CS+ but not the CS-. During generalisation testing, synonyms of the CS+ (e.g., soup; GCS+) and CS- (e.g., help; GCS-) were presented in the absence of shock. Conditioned fear and avoidance, measured via skin conductance responses, behavioural avoidance and US expectancy ratings, generalised to the semantically related, but not to the semantically unrelated, synonyms.

A particularly important measure for the return of fear is reinstatement, but no human studies to date have examined the impact of estradiol on fear reinstatement. Forty-two healthy females completed a differential fear conditioning, extinction and reinstatement task with skin conductance response (SCR) amplitude indexing level of conditioned fear. Saliva samples were taken to measure estradiol and progesterone. To examine fear reinstatement, SCR amplitude was compared between the last trial of the late extinction phase to the first re-extinction trial following the unsignaled presentation of two aversive electric shocks. No significant effects of estradiol were found for acquisition of fear conditioning or fear extinction learning. Lower estradiol predicted a significantly larger generalized SCR amplitude at re-extinction (post-reinstatement) in women. This provides novel evidence suggesting a protective role of estradiol in potentially reducing the relapse of fear following re-exposure to aversive stimuli, although further research is necessary in clinical populations to clarify this effect.","[Felmingham, Kim L.; Caruana, Julia M.; Miller, Lisa N.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ney, Luke J.; Zuj, Daniel, V; Hsu, Chia Ming K.; Nicholson, Emma; To, Annie] Univ Tasmania, Sch Med, Div Psychol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Zuj, Daniel, V] Swansea Univ, Dept Psychol, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Bryant, Richard A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Felmingham, KL (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",kfelmingham@unimelb.edu.au,,"Ney, Luke/0000-0003-0209-8366",National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [APP 1073041],This work was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (APP 1073041) .,,52,1,1,1,5,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

This process is strongly dependent on successful memory formation and consolidation. Stimulation of the vagus nerve enhances memory formation in both animals and humans. The objective of this study was to assess whether transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve (tVNS) can accelerate extinction memory formation and retention in fear conditioned humans. To assess fear conditioning and subsequent fear extinction, we assessed US expectancy ratings, fear potentiated startle responses and phasic heart rate responses. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in thirty-one healthy participants. After fear conditioning participants were randomly assigned to receive tVNS or sham stimulation during the extinction phase. Retention of extinction memory was tested 24 h later. tVNS accelerated explicit fear extinction learning (US expectancy ratings), but did not lead to better retention of extinction memory 24 h later. We did not find a differential physiological conditioning response during the acquisition of fear and thus were unable to assess potential effects of tVNS on the extinction of physiological indices of fear. These findings complement recent studies that suggest vagus nerve stimulation could be a promising tool to improve memory consolidation and fear extinction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

At present, these conditions are quantified by self-report questionnaires that only apply to behaviors that are accessible to consciousness, or by the timing of responses to fear- and anxiety-related words that are indirect since they do not produce fear, e.g., Dot Probe Test and emotional Stroop. We now review the conditioned responses (CRs) to fear produced by a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus CS+) when it cues a painful laser unconditioned stimulus (US). These CRs include autonomic (Skin Conductance Response) and ratings of the CS+ unpleasantness, ability to command attention, and the recognition of the association of CS+ with US (expectancy). These CRs are directly related to fear, and some measure behaviors that are minimally accessible to consciousness e.g., economic scales. Fear-related CRs include non-phase-locked phase changes in oscillatory EEG power defined by frequency and time post-stimulus over baseline, and changes in phase-locked visual and laser evoked responses both of which include late potentials reflecting attention or expectancy, like the P300, or contingent negative variation. Increases (ERS) and decreases (ERD) in oscillatory power post-stimulus may be generalizable given their consistency across healthy subjects. ERS and ERD are related to the ratings above as well as to anxious personalities and clinical anxiety and can resolve activity over short time intervals like those for some moods and emotions. These results could be incorporated into an objective instrumented test that measures EEG and CRs of autonomic activity and psychological ratings related to conditioned fear, some of which are subliminal. As in the case of instrumented tests of vigilance, these results could be useful for the direct, objective measurement of multiple aspects of the risk, diagnosis, and monitoring of therapies for anxiety disorders and anxious personalities.","[Chien, Jui-Hong; Meeker, Timothy J.; Saffer, Mark I.; Lenz, Fred A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Colloca, Luana] Univ Maryland, Sch Nursing, Dept Pain Translat Symptom Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Colloca, Luana] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Korzeniewska, Anna] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Bienvenu, O.

It is also widely regarded as a model for the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders in a diathesis-stress model of psychopathology. Starting from the apparent paradox between the adaptive nature of fear conditioning and the dysfunctional nature of pathological anxiety, we present a critique of the human fear conditioning paradigm as an experimental model for psychopathology. We discuss the potential benefits of expanding the human fear conditioning paradigm by (1) including action tendencies as an important index of fear and (2) paying more attention to weak (i.e., ambiguous) rather than strong fear learning situations (Lissek et al., 2006), such as contained in selective learning procedures. We present preliminary data that illustrate these ideas and discuss the importance of response systems divergence in understanding individual differences in vulnerability for the development of pathological anxiety.

A common functional A -> G single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNFval66met) in the prodomain of the human BDNF gene is associated with abnormal intracellular trafficking and reduced activity-dependent BDNF release. We studied the effect of BDNFval66met in an aversive differential fear conditioning, and a delayed extinction paradigm in 57 healthy participants. Pictures of male faces were used as stimuli and fear learning was quantified by fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance responses (SCR). Aware BDNF met-carriers show a deficit in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning as indicated by an absence of FPS responses in the last acquisition block. This deficit was maintained in the first block of extinction. No genotype differences were found in conditioned SCR discrimination. These data provide evidence for the involvement of BDNF signaling in human amygdala-dependent learning.

Since then, fear incubation has been demonstrated in both humans and nonhumans. However, the difficulty of demonstrating long-lasting fear incubation in rodents has hampered the study of the underlying mechanisms of this incubation. Here, we describe a rat procedure where fear reliably incubates over time. Methods: We trained food-restricted rats to lever-press for food pellets in daily 90-min sessions. We then gave each rat 100 30-sec tones co-terminating with a.5-sec.5-mA footshock over 10 days (10 pairings/day). Groups of rats (n = 10-15) were then given four presentations of the tone (the fear cue) 2, 15, 31, or 61 days after fear conditioning training and were assessed for conditioned suppression of lever-pressing. Results: We found that conditioned fear responses were significantly higher 31 and 61 days after fear training than after 2 or 15 days. In control experiments, we showed that extensive tone-shock pairing is necessary for the emergence of fear incubation and that it is unlikely that non-associative factors contribute to this incubation. Conclusions: We describe a procedure for generating reliable and long-lasting conditioned fear incubation. Our procedure can be used to study mechanisms of fear incubation and might provide a model for studying the mechanisms of delayed-onset posttraumatic stress disorder that occur in a sub-population of people previously exposed to chronic stressors.","[Pickens, Charles L.; Golden, Sam A.; Adams-Deutsch, Tristan; Nair, Sunila G.; Shaham, Yavin] NIDA, Behav Neurosci Branch, Intramural Res Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA",,"Shaham, Y (corresponding author), NIDA, Behav Neurosci Branch, Intramural Res Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 251 Bayview Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",yshaham@intra.nida.nih.gov,"Nair, Sunila/AAW-7600-2020; shaham, yavin/G-1306-2014; Pickens, Charles L/E-8984-2010","Golden, Sam/0000-0002-2104-2272; Pickens, Charles/0000-0003-3485-949X",National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission; Intramural Research Program; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [ZIADA000434] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program.

Using more potent amnestic drugs, post-reactivation amnesia has been shown in animals to be reversible by re-administration of the drug prior to memory retention testing. The latter finding suggests that, at least under some circumstances, post-reactivation amnesia may not reflect a disruption of reconsolidation (i.e., a memory storage deficit) but an acquired state-dependency of memory expression (i.e., a memory retrieval deficit that is relieved when the drug state is recreated during testing). We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate whether the previously established amnestic effects of post-reactivation propranolol administration on memory retention in humans may similarly reflect a retrieval deficit. In four groups of participants, fear memories were first established through differential fear conditioning. One day later, a single presentation of the CS+ without shock was used to reactivate the memory in three of the four groups, followed by the administration of 40 mg Propranolol HCl (Groups PrPI and PrPr) or placebo (Group PIPI). Memory was not reactivated in the fourth group (Group NR). Another 24 h later, Propranolol HCl (Group PrPr) or placebo (Groups PrPI, PIPI, and NR) was again administered, followed by a test of memory retention (extinction testing) and recovery (reinstatement testing). We did not observe any effects of post-reactivation propranolol on memory retention; conditioned responding was similar for all groups at the start of retention testing and similarly sensitive to recovery through reinstatement. We did observe an acute effect of propranolol administration on fear-potentiated startle responding during retention testing in Group PrPr, where participants exhibited attenuated startle responses during extinction testing but similar sensitivity to reinstatement as participants in the other groups. While our findings fail to corroborate previous reports of propranolol-induced post-reactivation amnesia in humans, they do point to acute effects of propranolol administration on extinction performance.","[Chalkia, Anastasia; Beckers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Chalkia, Anastasia; Van Oudenhove, Lukas; Beckers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Brain Inst, Leuven, Belgium; [Weermeijer, Jeroen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Contextual Psychiat, Dept Neurosci, Leuven, Belgium; [Van Oudenhove, Lukas] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Brain Gut Axis Studies, Translat Res Ctr Gastrointestinal Disorders, Dept Chron Dis Metab & Ageing, Leuven, Belgium",,"Beckers, T (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium.; Beckers, T (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Brain Inst, Leuven, Belgium.",tom.beckers@kuleuven.be,"Beckers, Tom/C-6164-2008; Chalkia, Anastasia/AAL-5989-2020","Beckers, Tom/0000-0002-9581-1505; Chalkia, Anastasia/0000-0002-1613-2281; Van Oudenhove, Lukas/0000-0002-6540-3113","European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [648176]; Hercules Foundation, Belgium [AKUL/13/07, AKUL/11/08]","This work was funded by Consolidator Grant 648176 of the European Research Council (ERC) awarded to TB.

In contrast, the overgeneralization of fear is maladaptive and is a hallmark of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric illness that is characterized by chronic symptomatology and a higher incidence in women compared to men. Therefore, understanding the neural basis of fear generalization at remote time-points in female animals is of particular translational relevance. However, our understanding of the neurobiology of fear generalization is largely restricted to studies employing male mice and focusing on recent time-points (i.e., within 24-48 h following conditioning). To address these limitations, we examined how male and female mice generalize contextual fear at remote time intervals (i.e., 3 weeks after conditioning). In agreement with earlier studies of fear generalization at proximal time-points, we find that the test order of training and generalization contexts is a critical determinant of generalization and context discrimination, particularly for female mice. However, tactile elements that are present during fear conditioning are more salient for male mice. Our study highlights long-term sex differences in defensive behavior between male and female mice and may provide insight into sex differences in the processing and retrieval of remote fear memory observed in humans.","[Asok, Arun; Hijazi, Joud; Harvey, Lucas R.; Kosmidis, Stylianos; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Asok, Arun; Hijazi, Joud; Harvey, Lucas R.; Kosmidis, Stylianos; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY USA",,"Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jbr2114@columbia.edu,,"Kosmidis, Stylianos/0000-0002-3534-5637",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1F32-MH114306]; Cohen Veterans Bioscience; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH114306] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We are grateful for the support from the National Institute of Mental Health 1F32-MH114306 (AA), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (EK), and Cohen Veterans Bioscience (JR and EK).",,76,6,6,1,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

One way to empirically evaluate the external validity of fear conditioning is by prospective studies. We review available prospective research investigating whether individual performance in fear conditioning predicts individual differences in anxiety levels and exposure-based treatment outcome. We focus on fear extinction, generalization, acquisition, and avoidance. Results suggest that reduced extinction and broader generalization predict higher anxiety levels. Results with respect to the predictive value of acquisition for anxiety levels are mixed. With regard to predicting exposurebased treatment outcome, some studies do find an association with extinction whereas others do not. The majority of studies does not find an association with acquisition. Evidence on extinction recall is limited and not consistent. The interpretation of these results requires caution. The number of available studies is limited. It is possible that not all work, in particular studies with only null effects, has found its way to publication. Future research on this topic will benefit from large sample sizes, preregistered hypotheses, full transparency about the conducted analyses and the publication of high-quality studies with null effects.","[Scheveneels, Sara; Boddez, Yannick; Hermans, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium",,"Scheveneels, S (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Ctr Learning Psychol & Expt Psychopathol, Tiensestr 102,Bus 3712, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",Sara.scheveneels@kuleuven.be,,"Scheveneels, Sara/0000-0003-1931-5777; Hermans, Dirk/0000-0003-4497-3982", [KU Leuven C1];  [C16/19/02];  [BOF16/MET_V/002],This work was funded by a KU Leuven C1 project (C16/19/02) awarded to Dirk Hermans.

Overall, the results suggest that instructed extinction reduces conditional fear responding and facilitates extinction learning, except when conditional stimulus valence is assessed as an index of fear or when fear is conditioned to images of animal fear-relevant stimuli (snakes and spiders) or with a very intense US.

This idea is embodied in exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders, where the intent of exposure is to reverse a history of avoidant behavior that is thought to fuel a patient's irrational fears. We tested in humans the relationship between fear and avoidance by combining Pavlovian differential fear conditioning with a novel task for quantifying spontaneous passive avoidant behavior. During self-guided navigation in virtual reality following de novo fear conditioning, we observed participants keeping their distance from the feared object. At the individual level, passive avoidant behavior was highly associated with maladaptive fear expression (fear-potentiated startle) during late extinction training, indicating that extinction learning was impaired following a brief episode of avoidance. Avoidant behavior, however, was not related to initial acquired fear, raising doubt about a straightforward link between physiological fear and behavioral avoidance. We conclude that a deeper understanding of what motivates avoidance may offer a target for early intervention, before fears transition from the rational to the irrational.","[Cornwell, Brian R.; Overstreet, Cassie; Krimsky, Marissa; Grillon, Christian] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cornwell, Brian R.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Life & Social Sci, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",,"Cornwell, BR (corresponding author), NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",bcornwell@swin.edu.au,,,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH020030, ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Daniel Pine, Katherine Vytal, and Oliver Robinson for helpful comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

Recently, P50 suppression deficits were found in patients with anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The processes of fear conditioning are thought to play roles in pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether sensory gating would be physiologically altered by fear conditioning. Methods: To clarify the relationship between classical fear conditioning and the sensory gating mechanism, we measured changes of P50 and N100 suppression of 21 healthy volunteers in control (baseline) phase, in fear acquisition phase, and in fear extinction phase. Results: The mean P50 S2/S1 ratio in fear acquisition phase was significantly elevated in comparison with that in control phase, and it recovered into basal level in extinction phase. In contrast, the mean N100 S2/S1 ratio showed no changes through all phases from fear acquisition to extinction. Conclusions: These results suggest that the P50 but not N100 sensory gating mechanism might be physiologically associated with fear acquisition and extinction.","[Kurayama, Taichi; Nakazawa, Ken; Matsuzawa, Daisuke; Yoshida, Susumu; Nanbu, Makoto; Suto, Chihiro; Shimizu, Eiji] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Integrat Neurophysiol, Chiba 2608670, Japan; [Shimizu, Eiji] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Ctr Prevent Med Sci, Chiba 2608670, Japan",,"Shimizu, E (corresponding author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Integrat Neurophysiol, Inohana 1-8-1, Chiba 2608670, Japan.",eiji@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Shimizu, Eiji/K-4637-2017; Kurayama, Taichi/V-8171-2019","Shimizu, Eiji/0000-0002-6741-9338; Matsuzawa, Daisuke/0000-0003-0408-2608; Sutoh, Chihiro/0000-0002-5191-8220",,,,47,7,8,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Here, we provide an account of state-of-the-art neural oscillatory correlates for the conditioning and extinction of fear, and also deal with recent translational efforts aimed at fear extinction by neural oscillatory modulation.","[Trenado, Carlos; Pedroarena-Leal, Nicole; Nitsche, Michael; Ruge, Diane] Tech Univ Dortmund, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Translat Neuromodulat Unit, Leibniz Ctr Working Environm & Human Factors, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Trenado, Carlos] Heinrich Heine Univ, Inst Clin Neurosci & Med Psychol, Fac Med, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Cif, Laura] Univ Montpellier, Dept Neurochirurg, Ctr Hosp Univ Montpellier, F-34000 Montpellier, France",,"Trenado, C; Ruge, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dortmund, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Translat Neuromodulat Unit, Leibniz Ctr Working Environm & Human Factors, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany.; Trenado, C (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ, Inst Clin Neurosci & Med Psychol, Fac Med, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",carlos.trenadoc@gmail.com; nicole.pedroarena.13@ucl.ac.uk; a-cif@chu-montpellier.fr; nitsche@ifado.de; ruge@ifado.de,"Nitsche, Michael A/B-6755-2012",,DFG-SFBGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [1280]; Dorothy Feiss Scientific Research Grant,DFG-SFB 1280 and The Dorothy Feiss Scientific Research Grant.,,53,8,8,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9059,,BIOMEDICINES,Biomedicines,JUN,2018,6,2,,,,,,,49,10.3390/biomedicines6020049,,,10,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Pharmacology & Pharmacy",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GK8PN,WOS:000436489000013,29724018,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-16,

The amygdala is vital for the association of cues and fear expression, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for fear regulation after extinction. The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) has an extensive connection with the fear circuit. In human studies, emotional regulation disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are often linked to an abnormality in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Therefore, in a series of experiments, we examined whether abnormal mOFC activities interfere with the regulation of learned fear. The mOFC of rats was pharmacologically activated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) during the acquisition, early consolidation, or retrieval phase of fear extinction. Under mOFC activation, there was a general initial suppression of the fear response followed by the development of nonspecific fear expression. Moreover, pre-extinction activation of the mOFC abolished extinction acquisition, causing an up-shift in the fear response during the retrieval test. Nonetheless, immediate post-extinction activation of the mOFC did not interfere with extinction consolidation. Overall, our results suggested that mOFC activation abolished fear extinction acquisition and interfered with fear expression.","[Hsieh, Hsin-Ti; Chang, Chun-hui] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Syst Neurosci, Kuang Fu Rd,Sec 2,101, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",,"Chang, CH (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Syst Neurosci, Kuang Fu Rd,Sec 2,101, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",changch@life.nthu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan MOST [106-2320-B-007-006-MY3]","This work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan MOST 106-2320-B-007-006-MY3 to CHC.

Several phenomena associated with the return of fear after extinction are discussed, including renewal, spontaneous recovery, reacquisition, and reinstatement. Additionally, this review describes recent work, which has focused on the role of psychological stress in the relapse of extinguished fear.

We hypothesized that if we presented fear-scented sweat to our canine seizure scent detection team, and they identified the fear scent as their seizure scent, then that would suggest that they are identical compounds. Methods: Following consent and approval, sweat samples taken from volunteers associated with the Brooke Gordon Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at Denver Health were processed by the Canine Assistants (CA) service dog team that had been imprinted to recognize the unique seizure scent from our previous study. In part one, sweat samples were collected from subjects, who had no prior history of epilepsy or seizures, under two different testing environments: watching a scary movie (It) and a neutral/comedy movie (Airplane!). In part two, a larger follow-up study utilizing fear sweat, exercise sweat, epilepsy sweat, and other distractor scents were provided in a multiple choice paradigm to better understand the inter-rater reliability of the canine responses. Results: In part one, our canine seizure scent detection team identified fear-scented sweat samples as their seizure scent in 4 of 5 study participants. There was almost perfect agreement of seizure scent detection during fear scent trials between the canine seizure scent detectors with a kappa value of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.668-0.960). In part two, (utilizing eleven different subjects) our canine scent detection team identified samples of either fear or seizure sweat with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 100% (no false positives) from among the multiple choices offered. Additionally, there was 92% agreement between the members of the canine scent detection team. Significance: While this hypothesis testing study is small and deserves replication, it confirms that the Canine Assistants seizure scent detection team consistently and accurately identified fear-scented sweat as their seizure scent, implying that the VOC, menthone, is common to both conditions. This further implies that human seizure propagation and fear network circuitry may share a common anatomy, and that menthone may not only be an early seizure biomarker, but a newly described human alarm pheromone.

Yet, a number of studies using Pavlovian cued fear conditioning have been unable to demonstrate an effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on acquisition or retention of fear conditioning. Evidence for the involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in emotional memories comes mostly from studies using fear inhibitory avoidance in rodents. It is possible that fear inhibitory avoidance is more akin to contextual conditioning than to cued fear conditioning, suggesting that context conditioning may be disrupted by beta-adrenergic blockade. Objective: This study investigated the effects of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol on cued and contextual fear conditioning in humans. Methods: Subjects were given either placebo (n=15) or 40 mg propranolol (n=15) prior to differential cued conditioning. A week later, they were tested for retention of context and cued fear conditioning using physiological (startle reflex and electrodermal activity) and subjective measures of emotional arousal. Results: The results were consistent with the hypothesis. The skin conductance level (SCL) and the subjective measure of arousal suggested reduced emotional arousal upon returning to the conditioning context in the propranolol group, compared to the placebo group. The acquisition and retention of cued fear conditioning were not affected by propranolol. Conclusions: These results suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in contextual fear conditioning.","NIMH, Mood Anxiety Disorder Program, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Connecticut VA Med Ctr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood Anxiety Disorder Program, NIH, DHHS, 15K North Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",christian.grillon@nih.gov,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH059906, P50MH052384, R37MH047840, R01MH057250, R01MH047840] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 47840, MH 57250, MH 52384, MH 59906] Funding Source: Medline",,,46,82,82,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,SEP,2004,175,3,,,,,342,352,,10.1007/s00213-004-1819-5,,,11,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,862YI,WOS:000224527000009,15007536,,,,2022-04-16,

Animal studies suggest that the neural circuitry responsible fear renewal includes the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsomedial (dmPFC) and ventromedial (vmPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, the neural mechanisms of context-dependent fear renewal in humans remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), combined with psychophysiology and immersive virtual reality, to elucidate how the hippocampus, amygdala, and dmPFC and vmPFC interact to drive the context-dependent renewal of extinguished fear. Healthy human participants encountered dynamic fear-relevant conditioned stimuli (CSs) while navigating through 3-D virtual reality environments in the MRI scanner. Conditioning and extinction were performed in two different virtual contexts. Twenty-four hours later, participants were exposed to the CSs without reinforcement while navigating through both contexts in the MRI scanner. Participants showed enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs) to the previously-reinforced CS + in the acquisition context on Day 2, consistent with fear renewal, and sustained responses in the dmPFC. In contrast, participants showed low SCRs to the CSs in the extinction context on Day 2, consistent with extinction recall, and enhanced vmPFC activation to the non-reinforced CS -. Structural equation modeling revealed that the dmPFC fully mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during fear renewal, whereas the vmPFC partially mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during extinction recall. These results indicate dissociable contextual influences of the hippocampus on prefrontal pathways, which, in turn, determine the level of reactivation of fear associations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: The participants were 39 low-risk adolescents (16 male/23 female) with a parental history of no psychiatric disorder and 35 high-risk adolescents (18 male/17 female) with a parental history of anxiety disorders. The magnitude of startle was examined at baseline and during anticipation of an aversive stimulus (fear-potentiated startle). Results: Startle was found to discriminate between children at high and low risk for anxiety disorders; however, different abnormalities for high-risk male and female subjects were observed. Startle levels, overall, were elevated among high-risk female subjects, whereas high-risk male subjects exhibited greater magnitude of startle potentiation during aversive anticipation. Conclusions: Startle reactivity may serve as a vulnerability marker for the development of anxiety disorders. With its basic grounding in animal and human behavioral research, startle may enhance our understanding of the underlying neurobiological bases of human anxiety states.

Fear can be innate or learned. Examples of innate fear include fears that are triggered by predators, pain, heights, rapidly approaching objects, and ancestral threats such as snakes and spiders. Animals and humans detect and respond more rapidly to threatening stimuli than to nonthreatening stimuli in the natural world. The threatening stimuli for most animals are predators, and most predators are themselves prey to other animals. Predatory avoidance is of crucial importance for survival of animals. Although humans are rarely affected by predators, we are constantly challenged by social threats such as a fearful or angry facial expression.

This observation has led many to examine sex differences in PTSD risk factors. Though relatively few, these studies reveal that the root causes of PTSD sex differences are complex, and partly represent interactions between sex-specific nonbiological and biological risk factors, which differentially shape PTSD vulnerability. Moreover, these studies suggest that sex-specific PTSD vulnerability is partly regulated by sex differences in fear systems. Fear, which represents a highly conserved adaptive response to threatening environmental stimuli, becomes pathological in trauma-and stress-based psychiatric syndromes, such as PTSD. Over the last 30 years, considerable progress has been made in understanding normal and pathological molecular and behavioral fear processes in humans and animal models. Thus, fear mechanisms represent a tractable PTSD biomarker in the study of sex differences in fear.

Sleep promotes both the consolidation of memory and the regulation of emotion. Sleep can influence consolidation and modification of memories associated with both fear and its extinction. After brief overviews of the behavior and neural circuitry associated with fear conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction memory in the rodent and human, interactions of sleep with these processes will be examined. Animal and human studies suggest that sleep can serve to consolidate both fear and extinction memory. In humans, sleep also promotes generalization of extinction memory. Time-of-day effects on extinction learning and generalization are also seen. Rapid eye movement (REM) may be a sleep stage of particular importance for the consolidation of both fear and extinction memory as evidenced by selective REM deprivation experiments. REM sleep is accompanied by selective activation of the same limbic structures implicated in the learning and memory of fear and extinction. Preliminary evidence also suggests extinction learning can take place during slow wave sleep. Study of low-level processes such as conditioning, extinction, and habituation may allow sleep effects on emotional memory to be identified and inform study of sleep's effects on more complex, emotionally salient declarative memories. Anxiety disorders are marked by impairments of both sleep and extinction memory. Improving sleep quality may ameliorate anxiety disorders by strengthening naturally acquired extinction. Strategically timed sleep may be used to enhance treatment of anxiety by strengthening therapeutic extinction learned via exposure therapy.","[Pace-Schott, Edward F.; Milad, Mohammed R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Pace-Schott, Edward F.; Milad, Mohammed R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Charlestown, MA USA; [Germain, Anne] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",,"Pace-Schott, EF (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp E, CNY 149 13th St Room 2624, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",epace-schott@mgh.harvard.edu,"Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018",," [MH090357];  [USAMRAA Log11293006];  [MH097965]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH097965, R21MH090357, R01MH097964] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Research supported by MH090357, USAMRAA Log11293006, MH097965.

Accordingly, variance in SERT functioning appears to constitute an important pathway to individual differences in anxiety. The current study tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in SERT function is associated with variability in the basic reflex physiology of defense. Healthy subjects (N = 82) were presented with clearly instructed cues of shock threat and safety to induce robust anxiety reactions. Subjects carrying at least one short allele for the 5-HITLPR polymorphism showed stronger fear-potentiated startle compared to long allele homozygotes. However, short allele carriers showed no deficit in the downregulation of fear after the offset of threat. These results suggest that natural variation in SERT function affects the magnitude of defensive reactions while not affecting the capacity for fear regulation.

It causes individuals to take actions and make choices that help them face the threat, such as by seeking out others because there is strength in numbers. We conjecture that fear also increases materialism in individuals because there is strength in things. The results from four experiments illustrate that situationally felt fear can increase materialistic orientation (Study 1) because of a desire for safety (Study 2). Importantly, fear increases preference for material and not experiential goods (Study 3). Finally, consistent with our theoretical account, having more material products (vs. experiences) can reduce fear (Study 4). Together, our findings across four studies suggest that fear increases materialism. Our findings also offer unique insights into another precursor or antecedent to materialism, a human value related to both possessiveness and selfishness and that restricts individuals' pursuit of true happiness.","[Longmire, Sierra J.; Chan, Eugene Y.; Lawry, C.

LY354740, a structural analogue of glutamate that shows specificity at the mGluR2/3 receptor, has anxiolytic effects in animal models. Objective. This study investigated the anxiolytic effects of LY354740 in humans using the fear-potentiated startle reflex methodology. Methods. Subjects were given either placebo (n=16), 20 mg LY354740 (n=15), or 200 mg LY354740 (n=13). The fear-potentiated startle tests examined startle potentiation to shock anticipation and to darkness. Results. Consistent with previous results, startle was increased by threat of shock and by darkness. LY354740 did not affect baseline startle. Correspondingly, subjects did not report LY354740 to be sedative. LY354740 significantly reduced the increase in startle magnitude during shock anticipation, but not during darkness. Subjective reports of state anxiety and negative affectivity during the fear-potentiated startle tests were also reduced in a dose-dependent manner by LY354740. Conclusions. These results suggest that LY354740 has an anxiolytic profile in humans without being sedative.","NIMH, NIH, DHHS, Mood & Anxiety Disorder Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Vet Adm Med Ctr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, NIH, DHHS, Mood & Anxiety Disorder Program, 15k North Dr,Msc 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,,,,,,46,157,159,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,AUG,2003,168,4,,,,,446,454,,10.1007/s00213-003-1444-8,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,711TA,WOS:000184756100009,12709777,Green Submitted,,,2022-04-16,

Animal studies have revealed a critical role for medial temporal lobe structures, particularly the amygdala, in simple and complex associative emotional responding. Whether these structures perform similar functions in humans is unknown. On both simple and conditional discrimination tasks, unilateral temporal lobectomy subjects showed impaired conditioned response acquisition relative to control subjects. This impairment could not be accounted for by deficits in nonassociative sensory or autonomic performance factors, or by differences in declarative memory for the experimental parameters. These results show that medial temporal lobe structures in humans, as in other mammals, are important components in an emotional memory network.","YALE UNIV,SCH MED,NEUROSURG SECT,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510; YALE UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06520",,"LABAR, KS (corresponding author), NYU,CTR NEURAL SCI,6 WASHINGTON PL,ROOM 809,NEW YORK,NY 10003, USA.",,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH38774, MH10537] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH038774, R37MH038774] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,56,430,432,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Departing from the theory on emotional appraisal coming from psychology, this study investigates which factors that modulate worry and fear associated with the presence of ticks among livestock owners of sheep and/or cattle. Methods: Survey data from 775 livestock owners in Norway were analysed by hierarchical multiple regression analysis with an index of fear of tick-borne diseases among livestock as the outcome variable. Results: Twenty-nine per cent of the livestock owners reported worry and fear of tick-borne diseases among their livestock. The model explained 35% of the variance in worry and fear. There was a weak association between esti-mated incidences of tick-borne diseases in livestock and livestock owners'worry and fear. Whereas previous personal experience of ticks and tick-borne diseases in livestock, and the livestock owners' appraisals of the situation were more strongly associated with relatively stronger feelings of worry and fear. Conclusions: Livestock owners'worry and fear of tick-borne diseases in livestock can partly be understood as their appraisals of perceived personal relevance of the presence of ticks, its potential negative implications for their daily life at large, and what potential they have to cope by different strategies to adapt or adjust to the situation.","[Johansson, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Environm Psychol, Lund, Sweden; [Mysterud, Atle] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Oslo, Norway; [Flykt, Anders] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Psychol, S-83125 Ostersund, Sweden",,"Johansson, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Environm Psychol, Lund, Sweden.",maria.johansson@mpe.lth.se,,,Lund University - Research Council of Norway [254694],Open access funding provided by Lund University.

Our systematic literature search identified 16 different operationalizations of the extinction retention index.

Less is known about the manner in which we can harness insights from Pavlovian conditioning research to reduce fears and, most importantly, make the reduction of fear lasting and resistant against relapse. The current paper reviews three manipulations that have shown promise in achieving a reduction of conditional fear that is more resistant to relapse than is the reduction of conditional fear after standard extinction: novelty-facilitated extinction training, presentation of conditional-unconditional stimulus pairings or of unpaired unconditional stimuli during extinction, and extinction with additional stimuli that are similar to the original conditional stimuli. It summarizes past research involving human and non-human animal subjects and highlights knowledge gaps in the current literature. Moreover, it discusses potential mechanisms that mediate the reduction of fear seen as a result of these manipulations in an attempt to enhance our understanding of what renders fear extinction less vulnerable to the known pathways to fear relapse.

In this study, participants were presented with repeated pairings of a conditioned stimulus with a shock, in either a single-cue or differential conditioning paradigm. Generalisation of fear was then tested by presenting stimuli that were novel, but similar to the conditioned stimulus along a spatial stimulus dimension. Dependent measures were online shock expectancy ratings and skin conductance level. A diverse range of generalisation gradients was observed, and the shape of the gradients for both expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses corresponded with participants' verbally reported rules. The findings point to an important role for cognitively controlled processes in human fear generalisation, and provide support for a single-system learning model. They also highlight the potential importance of cognitive reappraisal in clinical treatments for over-generalised fear.","[Wong, Alex H.

Humans have strong numerical effects on wild animal populations, as highly efficient hunters and through unintentional impacts of human activity and development. Human disturbance also induces costly non-lethal effects by changing the behavior of risk-averse animals. Here, we suggest that the unique strength of these lethal and non-lethal effects is amplified by mismatches between the nature of risk associated with anthropogenic stimuli and the corresponding response by wild animals. We discuss the unique characteristics of cues associated with anthropogenic stimuli in the context of animal ecology and evolutionary history to explore why and when animals fail to appropriately (a) detect, (b) assess, and (c) respond to both benign and lethal stimuli. We then explore the costs of over-response to a benign stimulus (Type I error) and under-response to a lethal stimulus (Type II error), which can scale up to affect individual fitness and ultimately drive population dynamics and shape ecological interactions. Finally, we highlight avenues for future research and discuss conservation measures that can better align animal perception and response with risk to mitigate unintended consequences of human disturbance.","[Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, Truckee, CA USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061; Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",Schmidt Science Fellows program; Rhodes Trust; UC Santa Barbara Library Open Access Publishing Fund,"KG was supported by the Schmidt Science Fellows program, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust.

Yet, despite a strong clinical interest, a detailed understanding of these memory phases for contextual fear memories is still missing. Besides the well-known role of the hippocampus in encoding contextual fear behavior, growing evidence indicates that specific regions of the medial prefrontal cortex differentially regulate contextual fear acquisition and storage in both animals and humans that ultimately leads to expression of contextual fear memories. In this review, we provide a detailed description of the recent literature on the role of distinct prefrontal subregions in contextual fear behavior and provide a working model of the neuronal circuits involved in the acquisition, expression and generalization of contextual fear memories.","[Rozeske, R.

We hypothesized that the affective quality of handling techniques used during routine care influences the animals' fear of humans. We assessed responses of male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 32) to four handling treatments provided by caretakers from 57 to 74 days of age: (1) Minimal handling once weekly during cage cleaning (this handling was common to all treatments); (2) Exposed to a Passive hand for 2 min daily; (3) Tickled for 2 min daily, mimicking social play; (4) Restrained on back for 2 min daily, intended to mimic unreciprocated pinning by a dominant rat. Behaviour was assessed on days 77-87 during a Human Approach test of attraction to a human hand (HA; 2 min without hand, followed by 3 min with a familiar or unfamiliar passive hand), Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) and Cat Odour (CAT) tests of anxiety, and weighing and injection procedures (to assess ease of handling). In the HA test, Tickled rats reared (interpreted as non-fearful monitoring behaviour) more often than Restrained rats prior to hand presentation (P < 0.05). In the presence of the hand, Tickled rats reared more often, and made more hand contacts than Minimally-handled rats, and uttered more 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (interpreted as indicating positive affect) than rats from the Passive treatment. Both Tickled and Restrained rats spent more time near the hand than Minimally-handled rats (P < 0.05). Although rats from all treatments directed more behaviour towards a familiar hand, Tickled rats visited an unfamiliar hand more often than Minimally-handled rats (P < 0.05). The handling treatments did not affect ease of handling during weighing, or behaviour in the EPM or CAT tests. During the minute after receiving an intra-peritoneal injection, rats from the Tickled and Passive treatments spent more time rearing close to the experimenter than rats from the Minimally-handled and Restraint treatments (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, rats (N = 16) were tickled by one handler, and restrained by another. for 2 min daily over 15 days. When preference for the two handlers was compared, rats spent similar time near, and in contact with, both handlers, but nibbled their tickler's hand (interpreted as play solicitation) more often than the hand of their restraint handler (P < 0.05). The results from both experiments indicate that, unexpectedly, the Restraint treatment was not aversive to the rats. Both the Passive and Restraint treatments had some value in habituating rats to humans relative to minimal handling. Nevertheless, tickling was the most effective method for reducing rats' fear of humans and hence improving their emotional welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Fear of COVID-19 was a statistically significant mediator in the relationship between perceived stress and fear of childbirth. The COVID-19 epidemic may have a negative emotional impact on pregnant women, causing fear, stress and increased fear of childbirth. Childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic is perceived by women as a threat to their well-being and health.

This effect is likely to be mediated by a subcortical brain network centered on the amygdala. Consistent with this view, brain imaging studies show that masked facial stimuli activate the amygdala as do masked pictures of threatening animals such as snakes and spiders. When the stimulus conditions allow conscious processing, the amygdala response to feared stimuli is enhanced and a cortical network that includes the anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula is activated. However, the initial amygdala response to a fear-relevant but non-feared stimulus (e.g. pictures of spiders for a snake phobic) disappears with conscious processing and the cortical network is not recruited. Instead there is activation of the dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortices that appears to inhibit the amygdala response. The data suggest that activation of the amygdala is mediated by a subcortical pathway, which passes through the superior colliculi and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus before accessing the amygdala, and which operates on low spatial frequency information.

Upon retrieval a memory may be rendered labile and vulnerable to the disruptive effects of amnestic agents. This process is referred to as disrupting reconsolidation and may point to a novel therapeutic strategy for the permanent reduction of fear in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. However, the fear-reducing effects are thus far only demonstrated for freezing reactions in rodents and autonomic fear responding in humans. If disrupting reconsolidation will be of value for clinical practice, it should also target the subjective feelings of anxiety. Using an instructed fear-learning paradigm in humans, we here tested whether disrupting reconsolidation would diminish the subjective feelings of anxiety for a noxious event that was anticipated but never actually experienced. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade during reconsolidation strongly diminished the behavioral expression of the instructed fear memory (i.e., startle responding) as well as the subjective feelings of anxiety 24 h later, yet without affecting both the physiological and cognitive component of the anticipation of threat (i.e., skin conductance responding, expectancy ratings). Together, the present findings suggest that the various memory traces of a learned fear association do not necessarily undergo reconsolidation in harmony. Considering that patients with anxiety disorders (1) often fear objects and situations that they have never actually experienced, and (2) primarily suffer from the subjective feelings of anxiety, the present findings may have important ramifications for psychotherapy.

The overlap between anxiety and major depressive disorder (MDD), the increased risk for depression and anxiety in offspring of depressed parents, the sequence of onset with anxiety preceding MDD, and anxiety as a predictor of depression are well established. The specificity of anxiety disorders in these relationships is unclear. This study, using a longitudinal high-risk design, examined whether anxiety disorders associated with the emotions fear and anxiety mediate the association between parental and offspring depression. Method. Two hundred and twenty-four second-generation and 155 third-generation descendants at high and low risk for depression because of MDD in the first generation were interviewed over 20 years. Probit and Cox proportional hazard models were fitted with generation 2 (G2) or G3 depression as the outcome and parental MDD as the predictor. In G2 and G3, fear- (phobia or panic) and anxiety-related [overanxious or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)] disorders were examined as potential mediators of increased risk for offspring depression, due to parental MDD. Results. In G2, fear-related disorders met criteria for mediating the association between parental MDD and offspring MDD whereas anxiety-related disorders did not. These results were consistent, regardless of the analytic methods used. Further investigation of the mediating effect of fear-related disorders by age of onset of offspring MDD suggests that the mediating effect occurs primarily in adolescent onset MDD. The results for G3 appear to follow similar patterns. Conclusions. These findings support the separation of anxiety disorders into at least two distinct forms, particularly when examining their role in the etiology of depression.","[Warner, V.; Wickramaratne, P.; Weissman, M.

In the current study, participants were fear conditioned to four different conditioned stimuli (CS) and underwent extinction either immediately or after a 24 h delay. During extinction, we manipulated CS contingency awareness by presenting two of the CSs (one CS+, one CS-) under non-masked conditions and the other two CSs under masked conditions. Compared to delayed extinction, immediate extinction of non-masked CSs promoted less extinction of fear-potentiated startle and shock expectancy ratings and less reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle without affecting shock expectancy ratings.

Subjects: The subjects were outbred Wistar rats randomly assigned to one of two groups: contextual fear (FR; n = 7) or contextual extinction (EXT, n = 7). Interventions: The rats were surgically implanted with electrodes for recording the electroencephalogram and electromyogram for determining arousal state. Measurements and Results: There were no differences between groups on FT% during ST or the first 30 min of CR; however, during R, the FIR group had greater FT% than EXT Sleep did not differ between groups following ST Following CR, EXT exhibited significantly more total sleep, NREM, and REM than FR. After R, there were no differences between groups. Conclusions: Rats that exhibit extinction of contextual fear show significantly increased sleep compared to rats who continue to exhibit contextual fear. This suggests that sleep disturbances normally experienced in humans following traumatic events or reminders may be ameliorated by therapies that address and eliminate the associated fear.","[Wellman, Laurie L.; Yang, Linghui; Tang, Xiangdong; Sanford, Larry D.] Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Dept Anat & Pathol, Sleep Res Lab, Norfolk, VA 23507 USA",,"Sanford, LD (corresponding author), Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Dept Anat & Pathol, Sleep Res Lab, POB 1980, Norfolk, VA 23507 USA.",SanforLD@evms.edu,,"Tang, Xiangdong/0000-0001-6876-3328","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH061716, MH64827, R01 MH064827, MH61716] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH061716, R01MH064827] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,31,44,44,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0161-8105,1550-9109,,SLEEP,Sleep,JUL 1,2008,31,7,,,,,1035,1042,,,,,8,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,321GX,WOS:000257293800015,18652099,,,,2022-04-16,

Pioneering work in rodents has further shown that vmPFC-amygdala theta synchronization is correlated with fear memory consolidation. We aimed to evaluate whether vmPFC activity during fear conditioning is (1) correlated with fear expression the subsequent day and whether (2) this relationship is mediated by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We analyzed data from 17 young healthy subjects undergoing a fear conditioning task, followed by a fear extinction task 24 h later, both recorded with simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements, with a polysomnographically recorded night sleep in between. Our results showed a correlation between vmPFC activity during fear conditioning and subsequent REM sleep amount, as well as between REM sleep amount and SCR to the conditioned stimulus 24 h later. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between vmPFC activity during fear conditioning and SCR responses during extinction, which was no longer significant after controlling for REM sleep amount. vmPFC activity during fear conditioning was further correlated with sleep latency. Interestingly, hippocampus activity during fear conditioning was correlated with stage 2 and stage 4 sleep amount. Our results provide preliminary evidence that the relationship between REM sleep and fear conditioning and extinction observed in rodents can be modeled in healthy human subjects, highlighting an interrelated set of potentially relevant trait markers.","[Spoormaker, V.

This study describes a novel training protocol to assess phasic and sustained fear in freely behaving C57BL/6J mice, using freezing and/or fear-potentiated startle as measures of fear, thereby, if needed, allowing in vivo application of various techniques, such as optogenetics, electrophysiology and pharmacological intervention, in freely behaving animals. An auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, with pseudo-randomized conditioned-unconditioned stimulus presentations at various durations, is combined with repetitive brief auditory white noise burst presentations during fear memory retrieval 24 h after fear conditioning. Major findings are that (1) a motion sensitive platform built on mechano-electrical transducers enables measurement of startle responses in freely behaving mice, (2) absence or presence of startle stimuli during retrieval as well as unpredictability of a given threat determine phasic and sustained fear response profiles and (3) both freezing and startle responses indicate phasic and sustained components of behavioral fear, with sustained freezing reflecting unpredictability of conditioned stimulus (CS)/unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings. This paradigm and available genetically modified mouse lines will pave the way for investigation of the molecular and neural mechanisms relating to the transition from phasic to sustained fear.","[Daldrup, T.; Remmes, J.; Lesting, J.; Gaburro, S.; Pape, H. -C.; Seidenbecher, T.] Univ Munster, Inst Physiol 1, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Fendt, M.] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Fendt, M.] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Ctr Behav Brain Sci, Magdeburg, Germany; [Meuth, P.] Univ Munster, Dept Neurol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Meuth, P.] Univ Munster, Inst Neuropathophysiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Kloke, V.] Univ Munster, Dept Behav Biol, D-48149 Munster, Germany",,"Seidenbecher, T (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Physiol 1, Robert Koch Str 27a, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",papechris@ukmuenster.de; seidenbe@uni-muenster.de,"Fendt, Markus/G-1888-2013; Gaburro, Stefano/AAN-3752-2020","Fendt, Markus/0000-0002-3451-1226; Gaburro, Stefano/0000-0001-9297-3472","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB-TRR58, TP A02]","We thank E.

Interestingly, the declarative memory for the fear association remained intact. These results asked for a solid replication. Moreover, given the constructive nature of memories, the intact recollection of the fear association could eventually 'rebuild' the fear memory, resulting in the spontaneous recovery of the fear response. Yet, perseverance of the amnesic effects would have substantial clinical implications, as even the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders display high percentages of relapse. Using a differential fear conditioning procedure in humans, we replicated our previous findings by showing that administering propranolol (40 mg) prior to memory reactivation eliminated the startle fear response 24 h later. But most importantly, this effect persisted at one month follow-up. Notably, the propranolol manipulation not only left the declarative memory for the acquired contingency untouched, but also skin conductance discrimination. In addition, a close association between declarative knowledge and skin conductance responses was found. These findings are in line with the supposed double dissociation of fear conditioning and declarative knowledge relative to the amygdala and hippocampus in humans. They support the view that skin conductance conditioning primarily reflects contingency learning, whereas the startle response is a rather specific measure of fear. Furthermore, the results indicate the absence of a causal link between the actual knowledge of a fear association and its fear response, even though they often operate in parallel. Interventions targeting the amygdalar fear memory may be essential in specifically and persistently dampening the emotional impact of fear. From a clinical and ethical perspective, disrupting reconsolidation points to promising interventions persistently erasing fear responses from trauma memory without affecting the actual recollection.

This study tested the hypothesis that the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF1) antagonist GSK561679 differentially reduces anxiety but increases fear in humans. A total of 31 healthy females received each of four treatments; placebo, 50 mg GSK561679 (low-GSK), 400 mg GSK561679 (high-GSK), and I mg alprazolam in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions during each of the four treatments. The three conditions included one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second during which shocks were administered unpredictably, and a third condition without shock. Fear and anxiety were assessed using the acoustic startle reflex. High-GSK had no effect on startle potentiation during unpredictable threat (anxiety) but increased startle potentiation during the predictable condition (fear). Low-GSK did not affect startle potentiation across conditions. Consistent with previous findings, alprazolam reduced startle potentiation during unpredictable threat but not during predictable threat. The increased fear by high-GSK replicates animal findings and suggests a lift of the inhibitory effect of the BNST on the amygdala by the CRF1 antagonist.","[Grillon, Christian; Hale, Elizabeth; Lieberman, Lynne; Davis, Andrew; Pine, Daniel S.; Ernst, Monique] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, MAP, 15K North Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 113,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,"Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019",,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIA MH002798]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH069056]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798, U19MH069056] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health (ZIA MH002798) and by the NIMH grant MH069056 to CG.

In contrast, supernatural fears do not involve direct experience but seem to be related to sensory or cognitive biases in the interpretation of stimuli as well as culturally driven cognitions and beliefs. In this multidisciplinary synthesis and collaborative review, we claim that supernatural beliefs are super natural. That is, they occur spontaneously and are easy to acquire, possibly because such beliefs rest on intuitive concepts such as mind-body dualism and animism, and may inspire fear in believers as well as non-believers. As suggested by psychological and neuroscientific evidence, they tap into an evolutionarily prepared fear of potential impending dangers or unknown objects and have their roots in prepared fears as well as cognitively prepared beliefs, making fear of supernatural agents a fruitful research avenue for social, anthropological, and psychological inquires.","[Coelho, Carlos M.; Suttiwan, Panrapee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Zsido, Andras N.] Univ Pecs, Inst Psychol, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary; [Clasen, Mathias] Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Coelho, Carlos M.] Univ Inst Maia, Maia, Portugal; [Coelho, Carlos M.] Univ Porto, Ctr Psychol, Porto, Portugal; [Suttiwan, Panrapee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Life Di Ctr, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",,"Suttiwan, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.; Suttiwan, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Life Di Ctr, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",panrapee.s@chula.ac.th,"; Coelho, Carlos/A-5065-2010","Clasen, Mathias/0000-0003-0830-0078; Coelho, Carlos/0000-0002-2320-7931; Zsido, Andras/0000-0003-0506-6861","Rachadapisek Sompote Fund for Postdoctoral Fellowship, Chulalongkorn University; Foundation for Science and Technology PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [FCT UIDB/00050/2020]; European UnionEuropean Commission; European Social Fund Comprehensive Development for Implementing Smart Specialization Strategies at the University of Pecs [EFOP-3.6.1.-16-2016-00004]; New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology [UNKP-20-4]; Independent Research Fund Denmark [0132-00204B]; Center for Psychology at the University of Porto","Carlos M.

Oxytocin (OT) is a mammalian neuropeptide that modulates activation of fear extinction-based neural circuits and fear responses. Little is known, however, about the effects of OT treatment on conditioned fear responding and extinction in humans. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of OT in a fear-potentiated startle task of fear conditioning and extinction. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 44 healthy human participants was conducted. Participants underwent a conditioned fear acquisition procedure, after which they were randomized to treatment group and delivered OT (24 IU) or placebo via intranasal (IN) spray. Forty-five minutes after treatment, participants underwent extinction training. Twenty-four hours later, subjects were tested for extinction recall. Relative to placebo, the OT group showed increased fear-potentiated startle responding during the earliest stage of extinction training relative to placebo; however, all treatment groups showed the same level of reduced responding by the end of extinction training. Twenty-four hours later, the OT group showed significantly higher recall of extinction relative to placebo. The current study provides preliminary evidence that OT may facilitate fear extinction recall in humans. These results support further study of OT as a potential adjunctive treatment for extinction-based therapies in fear-related disorders.","[Acheson, Dean; Feifel, David; Mckinney, Rebecca; Lohr, James; Risbrough, Victoria] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [de Wilde, Sofieke] Univ Utrecht, Div Pharmacol, Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Lohr, James; Risbrough, Victoria] Vet Affairs Ctr Excellence Stress & Mental Hlth C, La Jolla, CA USA",,"Risbrough, V (corresponding author), Vet Affairs Ctr Excellence Stress & Mental Hlth C, La Jolla, CA USA.",vrisbrough@ucsd.edu,"Risbrough, Victoria/X-3344-2019; Feifel, David/AAB-9541-2020",,"Veterans Affairs Center for Excellence in Stress and Mental Health; Defense Medical Research and Development Program [DM102425, R34 MH091285]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD) Young Investigator Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R34MH091285] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","These studies were supported by the Veterans Affairs Center for Excellence in Stress and Mental Health (VB, JL), Defense Medical Research and Development Program award #DM102425 (VB, DA), R34 MH091285 (DF), and a Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD) Young Investigator Award (DA).",,47,95,100,1,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,SEP,2013,229,1,,,,,199,208,,10.1007/s00213-013-3099-4,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,202LY,WOS:000323219300020,23644911,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-16,

Evidence suggests that the return of conditioned fear through spontaneous recovery, reinstatement, or renewal can be prevented by blockading this reconsolidation process using pharmacological or behavioral interventions. Postretrieval-extinction learning has been shown to prevent the return of cued fear in humans using fear-irrelevant stimuli, as well as cued and contextual fear in rodents. The effects of postretrieval extinction on human contextually controlled cued fear to fear-relevant stimuli remain unknown, and are the focus of the present study. The experimental design was based on 3 consecutive days: acquisition, reactivation and extinction, and re-extinction. For the fear conditioning, 2 zoo frames served as different contexts, 5 fear-relevant stimuli (aversive animal pictures) served as conditioned stimuli (CS), electric shocks served as unconditioned stimuli (UCS). Expectancy ratings and skin-conductance response (SCR) were used as measures of fear responses; spontaneous recovery and renewal were used as indicators of the return of fear. The expectancy ratings and SCR results indicated spontaneous recovery on the third day, regardless of retrieval prior to extinction. No robust renewal effect was seen. It is suggested that the use of fear-relevant stimuli, the context salience, or reactivation context may explain the lack of reconsolidation effect. Our study indicates that the beneficial effects of postretrieval-extinction learning are sensitive to subtle methodological changes.","[Drexler, Shira Meir; Merz, Christian J.; Hamacher-Dang, Tanja C.; Marquardt, Veronica; Otto, Tobias; Wolf, Oliver T.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Drexler, Shira Meir; Hamacher-Dang, Tanja C.; Wolf, Oliver T.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Int Grad Sch Neurosci, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Fritsch, Nathalie] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Expt Psychol Lab, D-44780 Bochum, Germany",,"Wolf, OT (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",oliver.t.wolf@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,"Merz, Christian J/I-7635-2019","Merz, Christian J/0000-0001-5679-6595; Wolf, Oliver T./0000-0002-9320-2124; Meir Drexler, Shira/0000-0001-8797-6900; Otto, Tobias/0000-0002-9994-0910","German Research Foundation (DFG) Research Unit 1581 [WO 733/13-1, WO 733/13-2]","Funding for this study was provided by Project P5 (WO 733/13-1; 13-2) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) Research Unit 1581, Extinction Learning: Neural Mechanisms, Behavioral Manifestations, and Clinical Implications.

Recently, aberrant dopaminergic VTA signaling has also been implicated in anxiety-like behaviors in animal models. These findings, however, have yet to be extended to anxiety in humans. Here we hypothesized that clinical anxiety is linked to dysfunction of the mesocorticolimbic circuit during threat processing in humans; specifically, excessive or dysregulated activity of the mesocorticolimbic aversion circuit may be etiologically related to errors in distinguishing cues of threat versus safety, also known as overgeneralization of fear. To test this, we recruited 32 females with generalized anxiety disorder and 25 age-matched healthy control females. We measured brain activity using fMRI while participants underwent a fear generalization task consisting of pseudo-randomly presented rectangles with systematically varying widths. A mid-sized rectangle served as a conditioned stimulus (CS; 50% electric shock probability) and rectangles with widths of CS +/- 20%, +/- 40%, and +/- 60% served as generalization stimuli (GS; never paired with electric shock). Healthy controls showed VTA reactivity proportional to the cue's perceptual similarity to CS (threat). In contrast, patients with generalized anxiety disorder showed heightened and less discriminating VTA reactivity to GS, a feature that was positively correlated with trait anxiety, as well as increased mesocortical and decreased mesohippocampal coupling. Our results suggest that the human VTA and the mesocorticolimbic system play a crucial role in threat processing, and that abnormalities in this system are implicated in maladaptive threat processing in clinical anxiety.","[Cha, Jiook; Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Program Neurosci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Cha, Jiook] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Cha, Jiook] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Carlson, Joshua M.; DeDora, Daniel J.; Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Carlson, Joshua M.] No Michigan Univ, Dept Psychol, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; [Greenberg, Tsafrir; Proudfit, Greg H.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Dept Radiol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA",,"Mujica-Parodi, LR (corresponding author), Lab Computat Neurodiagnost, Dept Biomed Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",lilianne.strey@stonybrook.edu,"Cha, Jiook/A-5678-2013; Greenberg, Tsafrir/Q-7831-2016","Cha, Jiook/0000-0002-5314-7992; Greenberg, Tsafrir/0000-0001-9104-5148; Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne Rivka/0000-0002-3752-5519",Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N0014-04-1-005]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0954643]; Directorate For EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [0954643] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank L.

Although prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has identified brain regions that support Pavlovian conditioning, it remains unclear whether these regions support time-related processes important for this type of associative learning. Elucidating the neural substrates of temporal conditioning is important for a complete understanding of the Pavlovian conditioning process. Therefore, the present study used a temporal Pavlovian conditioning procedure to investigate brain activity that mediates the formation of temporal associations. During fMRI, twenty-three healthy volunteers completed a temporal conditioning procedure and a control task that does not support conditioning. Specifically, during the temporal conditioning procedure, the UCS was presented at fixed intervals (ITI: 20 s) while in the control condition the UCS was presented at random intervals (Average ITI: 20 s, ITI Range: 6-34 s). We observed greater skin conductance responses and expectancy of the UCS during fixed (i.e., temporal conditioning) relative to random (i.e., control procedure) interval trials. These findings demonstrate fixed trials support temporal conditioning, while random trials do not. During fixed interval trials, greater conditioned fMRI signal responses were observed within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, inferior and middle temporal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The current findings suggest these brain regions constitute a neural circuit that encodes the temporal information necessary for Pavlovian fear conditioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is a distinct need for methodology that aims to specifically address and prime fear under dynamic conditions, and to better determine the role of fear in movement preparation. This preliminary study investigated how fear priming influences fear of falling in young and older individuals, and assessed how changes in fear of falling map to movement behavior. Young (21.5 +/- 1.7 years,n= 10) and older (58.1 +/- 2.2 years) participants matched for height, weight, and sex were repeatedly exposed to four different and incrementally challenging laboratory-based slipping perturbations during a self-initiated, goal-directed step and reach task. Both younger and older cohorts showed similar heightened perceptions in fear of falling after fear priming, and changes in peak joint excursions including reduced ankle flexion, and increased lumbar flexion after fear priming. Age-related changes were only evident in total mediolateral center of mass displacement, with younger participants showing greater displacement after fear priming. Despite clear differences in preparatory muscle onsets relative to reach onset seen in older participants, muscle timings or co-contraction indices were not significantly different. Methods utilizing repeated exposure to varying increases of a slip-based postural challenge can successfully prime fear of falling in individuals, regardless of age.","[Stamenkovic, Alexander; van der Veen, Susanne M.; Thomas, James S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Motor Control Lab, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [van der Veen, Susanne M.; Thomas, James S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",,"Thomas, JS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Motor Control Lab, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.; Thomas, JS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",jthomas32@vcu.edu,"van der Veen, Susanne/ABA-9346-2020; Stamenkovic, Alexander/B-7395-2013","van der Veen, Susanne/0000-0003-2799-6816; Stamenkovic, Alexander/0000-0002-1010-9347","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01HD088417, R01AT006978]",AS was supported by NIH R01AT006978.

However, it has not been sufficiently examined whether other arthropods similarly elicit fear or disgust. Our aim was to examine if all arthropods are rated similarly, if only potentially dangerous arthropods (spiders, bees/wasps) elicit comparable responses, or if spiders are rated in a unique way. We presented pictures of arthropods (15 spiders, 15 beetles, 15 bees/wasps, and 15 butterflies/moths) to 76 students who rated each picture for fear, disgust, and how dangerous they thought the animal is. They also categorized each animal into one of the four animal groups. In addition, we assessed the participants' fear of spiders and estimates for trait anxiety. The ratings showed that spiders elicit significantly greater fear and disgust than any other arthropod group, and spiders were rated as more dangerous. Fear and disgust ratings of spider pictures significantly predicted the questionnaire scores for fear of spiders, whereas dangerousness ratings of spiders and ratings of other arthropods do not provide any predictive power. Thus, spider fear is in fact spider specific. Our results demonstrate that potential harmfulness alone cannot explain why spiders are feared so frequently. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In line with such evolutionary pressure, threat-signaling fear-conditioned faces have been found to rapidly (<80 ms) activate visual brain regions including the fusiform gyrus on the conditioning day. Whether remotely fear conditioned stimuli (CS) evoke similar early processing enhancements is unknown. Here, 16 participants who underwent a differential face fear-conditioning and extinction procedure on day 1 were presented the initial CS 24 h after conditioning (Recent Recall Test) as well as 9-17 months later (Remote Recall Test) while EEG was recorded. Using a data-driven segmentation procedure of CS evoked event-related potentials, five distinct microstates were identified for both the recent and the remote memory test. To probe intracranial activity, EEG activity within each microstate was localized using low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA). In both the recent (41-55 and 150-191 ms) and remote (45-90 ms) recall tests, fear conditioned faces potentiated rapid activation in proximity of fusiform gyrus, even in participants unaware of the contingencies.

Tobacco smoking has been strongly implicated in stress and anxiety disorder symptomatology, both as a contributing factor and as a vulnerability factor. Rodent studies from our lab have recently shown that acute and chronic nicotine exposure disrupts safety learning. However, it is unknown if these effects of nicotine translate to humans. The present studies addressed this gap by administering a translational differential cued fear conditioning paradigm to both mice and humans. In mice, we found that chronic nicotine exposure reduced discrimination between a conditioned stimulus (CS) that signals for danger (CS+) and another CS that signals for safety (CS) during both acquisition and testing. We then employed a similar differential cued fear conditioning paradigm in human smokers and non-smokers undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Smokers showed reduced CS+/CS- discrimination during fear conditioning compared to non-smokers. Furthermore, using fMRI, we found that subgenual and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activations were lower in smokers than in non-smokers during differential cued fear conditioning. These results suggest a potential biological mechanism underlying a dysregulated ability to discriminate between danger and safety cues. Our results indicate a clear parallel between the effects of nicotine exposure on safety learning in mice and humans and therefore suggest that smoking might represent a risk factor for inability to process information related to danger and safety related cues.","[Kutlu, Munir Gunes; Gould, Thomas J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biobehav Hlth, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Marin, Marie-France] Univ Montreal, Montreal Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Dept Psychiat, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Tumolo, Jessica M.] Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Kaur, Navneet; VanElzakker, Michael B.; Shin, Lisa M.] Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [VanElzakker, Michael B.; Shin, Lisa M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [VanElzakker, Michael B.; Shin, Lisa M.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA USA",,"Kutlu, MG (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",gunes.kutlu@psu.edu,,,"National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [DA017949]; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH054636]; Catalyst [1UL1RR025758, 8UL1TR000170, 1UL1TR001102]; Center for Functional Neuroimaging Technologies grant [P41RR14075]; Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) of the Office of Research & Development of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA017949] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was funded with grant support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (T.J.G., DA017949) and the National Institute of Mental Health (L.M.S., R01MH054636).

This research is guided by theoretical assumptions that, in some cases indirectly, stem from the tradition of association formation models (e.g., the Rescorla-Wagner model). We argue that one of these assumptions - fear responding as a monotonic function of the associative activation of aversive memory representations - restricts the types of treatment that the research community currently considers. We discuss the importance of this assumption in the context of research on extinction-enhancing and reconsolidation interference techniques. While acknowledging the merit of this research, we argue that unstrapping the straitjacket of this assumption can lead to exploring new directions for utilizing fear conditioning procedures in treatment research. We discuss two determinants of fear responding other than associative memory activation. First, fear responding might also depend on relational information. Second, a recent goal-directed emotion theory suggests that goals might be the primary determinant of the response pattern characterized as fear.","[Boddez, Yannick; Moors, Agnes; De Houwer, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Univ Groningen, Dept Clin Psychol & Expt Psychopathol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Moors, Agnes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Grp Quantitat Psychol & Individual Difference, Leuven, Belgium; [Moors, Agnes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Social & Cultural Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Mertens, Gaetan] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Boddez, Y (corresponding author), Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, Ghent 9000, Belgium.",yannick.boddez@ugent.be,"De Houwer, Jan/ABF-6866-2021; Mertens, Gatan/ABC-3386-2021; Moors, Agnes/C-6342-2008","De Houwer, Jan/0000-0003-0488-5224; Mertens, Gatan/0000-0003-1923-6657; Moors, Agnes/0000-0002-5137-557X","Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)FWO [G022313N, G073317N]; Research Fund of KU Leuven [C14/17/047]; Ghent University Methusalem Grant [BOF16/MET_V/002]; Dutch Fund for Scientific Research (NWO Vici)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [453-15-005]","Preparation of this article was supported by the Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO) (G022313N, G073317N), the Research Fund of KU Leuven (C14/17/047), Ghent University Methusalem Grant BOF16/MET_V/002, and the Dutch Fund for Scientific Research (NWO Vici) (453-15-005).

Injection of a variety of drugs after training in fear-conditioning paradigms can impair consolidation of fear memories. Indeed, early clinical trials suggest that immediate administration of such drugs after a traumatic event may decrease the risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder in humans (Pitman et al., 2002; Vaiva et al., 2003). The use of such a treatment is limited by the difficulty of treating every patient at risk and by the difficulty in predicting which patients will experience chronic adverse consequences. Recent clinical trials suggest that administration of glucocorticoids may have a beneficial effect on established posttraumatic stress disorder (Aerni et al., 2004) and specific phobia (Soravia et al., 2006). Conversely, glucocorticoid administration after training is known to enhance memory consolidation (McGaugh and Roozendaal, 2002; Roozendaal, 2002). From a clinical perspective, enhancement of a fear memory or a reactivated fear memory would not be desirable. We report here that when glucocorticoids are administered immediately after reactivation of a contextual fear memory, subsequent recall is significantly diminished. Additional experiments support the interpretation that glucocorticoids not only decrease fear memory retrieval but, in addition, augment consolidation of fear memory extinction rather than decreasing reconsolidation. These findings provide a rodent model for a potential treatment of established acquired anxiety disorders in humans, as suggested by others (Aerni et al., 2004; Schelling et al., 2004), based on a mechanism of enhanced extinction.","Univ Texas, SW Med Ctr, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; Vet Affairs Hosp, Dallas, TX 75216 USA",,"Greene, RW (corresponding author), 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",robertw.greene@utsouthwestern.edu,,"Powell, Craig/0000-0001-5451-2165; Greene, Robert/0000-0003-1355-9797","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K08MH065975] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K08 MH065975-03, MH065975, MH6045, K08 MH065975-05, K08 MH065975-04, K08 MH065975] Funding Source: Medline",,,49,177,177,0,19,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

To extend these findings to human volunteers, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural responses associated with context fear conditioning in humans. Our novel conditioning paradigm consisted of aversive electrical shocks ( unconditioned stimulus) that were delivered either cue or context related. Differential evoked responses, related to the conditioned stimulus (CS), were found in the anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral insular cortices, regions that have been implicated in anticipatory anxiety. In case of context conditioning, a similar pattern was observed during the presentation of the entire context. In line with previous conditioning studies, differential responses in the amygdala showed a time by stimulus interaction, suggesting rapid adaptation of CS-specific responses. More importantly, a similar differential decay of activation was observed during context conditioning in the hippocampus, in agreement with a role of the hippocampus in the acquisition phase of human context fear conditioning.","[Marschner, Andreas; Kalisch, Raffael; Buechel, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Vansteenwegen, Debora] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Vervliet, Bram] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Marschner, A (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",a.marschner@uke.uni-hamburg.de,"Vervliet, Bram/AAE-6276-2019; Kalisch, Raffael/H-6624-2016; Kalisch, Raffael/A-9863-2018","Vervliet, Bram/0000-0002-5904-4257",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 1247]; Emmy NoetherGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KA 1623/3-1]; Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Volkswagen-StiftungVolkswagen,"This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Grants GRK 1247 ( A.

This is due in part to genetic variation between individuals. However, only few genes have been identified that contribute to variation in learning and memory. Two inbred mouse strains, C57Bl/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), show significant variation both in fear conditioning memory as well as primary responsiveness to fear. Several studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes (Chr) 1 and 12 associated with performance in fear conditioning, but it is unclear if these QTL were associated with fear memory or innate fear responsiveness. To determine if these QTL are associated with fear memory or fear responsiveness, we studied congenic mouse strains harbouring D2-derived DNA from Chr1 or Chr12 on a B6 genetic background. Cohorts of D2, B6 and the congenic mice were tested throughout the process of fear conditioning by measuring a series of fear-related parameters. The Chr1 congenic mice showed clear deficits in fear memory compared to B6 mice, which established the presence of a QTL on Chr1 directly influencing fear memory. The Chr12 congenic mice also showed alterations in fear conditioning, but this was more associated with alterations in fear responsiveness. These findings thus provide evidence for the localisation of independent genetic determinants for fear memory and fear responsiveness.","[Wilson, Yvette M.; Murphy, Mark] Univ Melbourne, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Brodnicki, Thomas C.] St Vincents Inst, Immunol & Diabet Unit, Fitzroy, Vic 3065, Australia; [Lawrence, Andrew J.] Univ Melbourne, Florey Neurosci Inst, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Lawrence, Andrew J.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Neurosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,"Murphy, M (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",m.murphy@unimelb.edu.au,,"WILSON, YVETTE/0000-0002-1354-9540; Brodnicki, Thomas/0000-0003-2294-315X",National Health and Medical Research Council of AustraliaNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia,"These studies were supported by a project grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

Infections originating from industrialized pig farming have not been reported for decades in Europe, due to control measures to prevent the transmission of Trichinella from wildlife by indoor housing and good management practices. Therefore, risk-based monitoring programs might replace individual carcass control in industrialized pig farming as described in EU legislation SANCO 2075/2005. Transmission of Trichinella species between wildlife and the risk that may pose to humans via consumption of contaminated pork meat has not been studied quantitatively. One pathway by which human trichinellosis can occur is the rat-pig-human route. To evaluate the transmission risk though this pathway the dose responses of rat, pig, and human were studied. Experimental T spiralis infection was performed in rats with doses of as few as 10 parasites and the data set was analysed using a newly developed dose response model that describes larvae per gram (LPG). Experimental T. spiralis infection in pig was analysed in a similar way. Furthermore nine published outbreaks of human trichinellosis were analysed to determine the dose response in humans. The risk of human trichinellosis via the rat-pig-human transmission was simulated by the Monte Carlo method. A pair of female and male parasites representing the lowest infection pressure from the environment, led to the probability of human trichinellosis by consumption of 100 g of raw pork meat equal to 5% via the studied rat-pig-human pathway. In the absence of rodent control near the farm, a low infection pressure from wildlife presents a relatively high risk of human trichinellosis via consumption of uncooked pork meat.

Fear of falling in older fallers presenting at emergency departments. Aim. This paper is a report of an investigation of fear of falling in older people presenting to emergency departments after a fall. Background. Falls are a common and disabling cause of attendance at emergency departments. Fear of falling is an often unrecognized consequence of falls that affects older people's function. Methods. Sub-analysis was conducted of a randomized trial of a falls prevention programme for people aged 60 years and older presenting to emergency departments after a fall. Data were collected between 2003 and 2006 with 712 participants recruited (mean age 75, 70% female). Baseline and 12-month measurements included fear of falling (Modified Falls Efficacy Scale), falls risk, depression, and balance/mobility measures. Intervention participants received interventions based on assessment findings, while control participants received usual care. Repeated measures analysis of variance and logistic regression were used to determine change over time between groups and factors associated with fear of falling, respectively. Results. Sixty per cent of participants had fear of falling. Statistically significant improvement occurred in overall fear of falling (repeated measures analysis of variance - F = 37 center dot 3; P < 0 center dot 001) and 13 of 14 sub-items of the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale at 12 months, but there was no difference between groups. Multivariate logistic regression identified a number of factors associated with statistically significant increased odds of higher fear of falling persisting at12 months, including higher baseline fear of falling and multiple falls in the 12-month follow-up. Conclusion. Nursing staff in emergency departments have an important role in identifying fear of falling, which may guide the need for referral for further assessment and management after discharge from the emergency department.","[Hill, Keith] La Trobe Univ & No hlth, Musculoskeletal Res Ctr, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Hill, Keith; Blackberry, Irene] Natl Ageing Res Inst, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Womer, Makenzie] Slippery Rock Univ, Sch Phys Therapy, Slippery Rock, PA 16057 USA; [Womer, Makenzie] Drayer Phys Therapy, Bellefonte, PA USA; [Russell, Melissa] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Blackberry, Irene] Univ Melbourne, Dept Gen Practice, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [McGann, Anne] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Parkville, Vic 3050, Australia",,"Hill, K (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ & No hlth, Musculoskeletal Res Ctr, Bundoora, Vic, Australia.",keith.hill@latrobe.edu.au,"Hill, Keith D/L-6398-2017","Hill, Keith D/0000-0002-2191-0308; Blackberry, Irene/0000-0003-4482-4936; Russell, Melissa/0000-0002-3422-3726",Australian Government Department of Veterans' AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs; Victorian Department of Human Services,Funding was provided by the Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Victorian Department of Human Services.,,37,20,20,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-2402,1365-2648,,J ADV NURS,J.

Despite international attempts to mobilize governments and relevant stakeholders to address disaster risk more holistically, disaster risk reduction and human development remain detached from each other in many countries and communities. This paper explores government practitioners' views on an integration of disaster risk reduction and human development in the context of floods and droughts in Canada and Australia. The paper draws from a comparative case study analysis involving two Delphi studies and semi-structured interviews with Canadian and Australian practitioners at local, provincial/state, and federal levels. The findings from this study show a dominant view among participants that disaster risk reduction requires a broader engagement with human development systems that is adaptable to local contexts. This includes considerations - such as poverty, health and well-being, climate action, social equity and equality, and human agency - as well as mainstreaming disaster risk information in human development processes and activities. The research identifies mechanisms perceived as being critical to developing integrated approaches, including in effective legislation, policy frameworks, evidence-based decision-making, and cross-sector collaboration. While an integrated approach to disaster risk reduction and human development challenges the political and programmatic complexities for flood and drought risk reduction, approaches to disaster risk governance that reflect the capacities and needs of individuals and vulnerable populations must be developed.","[Raikes, Jonathan; Smith, Timothy F.; Baldwin, Claudia] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Smith, Timothy F.] Uppsala Univ, SWEDESD, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Baldwin, Claudia] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Henstra, Daniel] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",,"Raikes, J (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sustainabil Res Ctr, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",jonathan.raikes@research.usc.edu.au; tsmith5@usc.edu.au; cbaldwin@usc.edu.au; dhenstra@uwaterloo.ca,,,"Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT180100652]","This research is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship and through the Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects funding scheme (FT180100652) .

However, less is known about how anxiety sensitivity may interact with physiological modulation of arousal to predict anxious children's fear responses. The present investigation examined vagal withdrawal as a moderator of the association between anxiety sensitivity and anxious children's ability to downregulate subjective feelings of fear in response to an anxiety-provoking speech task. Observer ratings of anxious behaviors and performance during the task were also examined. It was hypothesized that children's anxiety sensitivity levels would interact with respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) suppression to explain unique variance in subjective fear downregulation, anxious behaviors, and task performance. Participants were 105 children with anxiety disorders (N = 105; M = 10.07 years, SD = 1.22; 57% female) who completed diagnostic interviews, questionnaires, a speech about their family, and an RSA assessment in baseline and speech conditions. Interactions between RSA suppression and anxiety sensitivity predicted unique variance in subjective fear downregulation. Specifically, the greatest difficulties downregulating subjective fear responses were exhibited by children with high anxiety sensitivity and low RSA suppression. Interactions between RSA suppression and anxiety sensitivity did not predict variance in observer ratings of anxious behaviors or task performance. However, higher baseline RSA and speech RSA were significantly associated with fewer anxious behaviors during the speech. Higher baseline RSA was also significantly associated with better speech performance. These findings highlight the importance of vagal withdrawal and its interaction with anxiety sensitivity in predicting downregulation of subjective fear among clinically anxious children.","[Viana, Andres G.; Trent, Erika S.; Raines, Elizabeth M.; Woodward, Emma C.; Zvolensky, Michael J.] Univ Houston, Dept Psychol, Hlth & Biomed Sci Bldg,Room 373, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Viana, Andres G.] Univ Houston, Texas Inst Measurement Evaluat & Stat, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Storch, Eric A.] Baylor Coll Med, Menninger Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zvolensky, Michael J.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Behav Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,"Viana, AG (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Psychol, Hlth & Biomed Sci Bldg,Room 373, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",agviana@uh.edu,,"Trent, Erika/0000-0003-4775-5999",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH101309];  [NCT02095340],This study was funded by Grant R21MH101309 (PI: Andres G.

While fear-conditioned stimuli (CS+) elicit overt behavior in many mammals, this is not the case in humans. Typically, autonomic nervous system activity is used to quantify fear memory in humans, measured by skin conductance responses (SCR). Here, we investigate whether heart period responses (HPR) evoked by the CS, often observed in humans and small mammals, are suitable to complement SCR as an index of fear memory in humans. We analyze four datasets involving delay and trace conditioning, in which heart beats are identified via electrocardiogram or pulse oximetry, to show that fear-conditioned heart rate deceleration (bradycardia) is elicited and robustly distinguishes CS+ from CS-. We then develop a psychophysiological model (PsPM) of fear-conditioned HPR. This PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of autonomic input into the heart. We show that the sensitivity to distinguish CS+ and CS- (predictive validity) is higher for model-based estimates than peak-scoring analysis, and compare this with SCR. Our work provides a novel tool to investigate fear memory in humans that allows direct comparison between species.","[Castegnetti, Giuseppe; Tzovara, Athina; Staib, Matthias; Paulus, Philipp C.; Hofer, Nicolas; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Castegnetti, Giuseppe; Tzovara, Athina; Staib, Matthias; Paulus, Philipp C.; Hofer, Nicolas; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Paulus, Philipp C.] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Psychol, Dresden, Germany; [Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England",,"Castegnetti, G (corresponding author), Psychiat Univ Klin Zurich, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",giuseppe.castegnetti@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik R/B-4302-2019","Bach, Dominik R/0000-0003-3717-2036; Tzovara, Athina/0000-0002-7588-1418; Staib, Matthias/0000-0001-9688-838X; Paulus, Philipp C./0000-0002-8148-3467",University of Zurich; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [320030_1449586/1]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [091593/Z/10/Z],This work was funded by the University of Zurich and by a project grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to DRB (320030_1449586/1).

To investigate these dimensions in birds, we have used two genetic lines of quail divergently selected on tonic immobility duration, a behavioural index of fear. These two lines differ in their behavioural response to some, but not all, fear-inducing situations. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of human intervention in the differentiation between the two lines. To do this, fear responses towards a novel object were compared between lines in three conditions: (1) in the home cage without any human intervention, (2) in the home cage after human handling and (3) after placement in a novel environment by human handling. Fear behaviour differed between lines after human handling, with or without placement in a novel environment, but presentation of a novel object in the home cage without any human intervention induced similar fear responses in the two lines of quail. These results lead us to suggest that in quail, human intervention evokes a dimension of fear that differs from that evoked by sudden presentation of a novel object, in that these two dimensions may be selected independently.

Much of this research utilizes classical fear conditioning, a simple paradigm that has been extensively investigated in animals, helping outline a brain circuitry thought to be responsible for the acquisition, expression and extinction of fear. The findings from non-human animal research have more recently been substantiated and extended in humans, using neuropsychological and neuroimaging methodologies. Research across species concur that the neural correlates of fear conditioning include involvement of the amygdala during all stages of fear learning, and prefrontal areas during the extinction phase. This manuscript reviews how animal models of fear are translated to human behavior, and how some fears are more easily acquired in humans (i.e., social-cultural). Finally, using the knowledge provided by a rich animal literature, we attempt to extend these findings to human models targeted to helping facilitate extinction or abolishment of fears, a trademark of anxiety disorders, by discussing efficacy in modulating the brain circuitry involved in fear conditioning via pharmacological treatments or emotion regulation cognitive strategies.

Previous research in humans separately examined the mechanisms underlying acquisition and extinction of aversive and appetitive conditioned responses. It is yet unclear how aversive and appetitive learning interact on a neural level during counterconditioning in humans. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the interaction of fear conditioning and subsequent reward learning. In the first phase (fear acquisition), images predicted aversive electric shocks or no aversive outcome. In the second phase (counterconditioning), half of the CS+ and CS- were associated with monetary reward in the absence of electric stimulation. The third phase initiated reinstatement of fear through presentation of electric shocks, followed by CS presentation in the absence of shock or reward. Results indicate that participants were impaired at learning the reward contingencies for stimuli previously associated with shock. In the counterconditioning phase, prior fear association interacted with reward representation in the amygdala, where activation was decreased for rewarded compared to unrewarded CS- trials, while there was no reward-related difference in CS+ trials. In the reinstatement phase, an interaction of previous fear association and previous reward status was observed in a reward network consisting of substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), where activation was increased by previous reward association only for CS- but not for CS+ trials. These findings suggest that during counterconditioning, prior fear conditioning interferes with reward learning, subsequently leading to lower activation of the reward network.","[Bulganin, Lisa; Wittmann, Bianca C.] Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol & Sports Sci, D-35415 Giessen, Germany; [Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Hosp Psychiat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England",,"Wittmann, BC (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol & Sports Sci, Otto Behaghel Str 10F, D-35415 Giessen, Germany.",bianca.wittmann@psychol.uni-giessen.de,"Wittmann, Bianca/C-1931-2008; Bach, Dominik R/B-4302-2019","Wittmann, Bianca/0000-0002-2583-3311; Bach, Dominik R/0000-0003-3717-2036",Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [091593] Funding Source: Medline,,,81,13,13,0,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Laboratory animal studies indicate that the amygdala both receives sensory information and produces learned behavioral and autonomic fear responses. However, prior functional imaging research in humans has largely focused on amygdala activity elicited by fearful stimuli giving less attention to this region's role in the production of fear responses. In contrast, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the amygdala's influence on the generation of conditional fear responses. Significant increases in amygdala activity were observed during the production of conditioned (learning-related), but not orienting, nonspecific, and unconditioned (nonlearning-related) skin conductance responses. Further, greater amygdala activity was demonstrated during conditioned response production than during conditioned stimulus presentation. These results suggest the amygdala not only responds to fearful stimuli, but also generates learning-related changes in human autonomic fear expression.

Programmatic laboratory research that examines the stress response of nicotine-deprived humans is necessary to confirm that stress neuroadaptations observed in animal models generalize to humans. Methods: Two experiments tested the prediction that nicotine deprivation selectively increases startle response associated with anxiety during unpredictable threat but not fear during imminent, predictable threat. Dependent smokers (n = 117) were randomly assigned to 24-hour nicotine-deprived or nondeprived groups and participated in one of two experiments wherein electric shock was administered either unpredictably (noncontingent shock; Experiment 1) or predictably (cue-contingent shock; Experiment 2). Results: Nicotine deprivation increased overall startle response in Experiment 1, which involved unpredictable administration of shock. Age of first cigarette and years of daily smoking were significant moderators of this deprivation effect. Self-reported withdrawal symptoms also predicted startle response during unpredictable shock. In contrast, nicotine deprivation did not alter overall or fear-potentiated startle in Experiment 2, which involved predictable administration of shock. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that startle response during unpredictable threat may be a biomarker of stress neuroadaptations among smokers in nicotine withdrawal.

However, it is unknown how the endogenous ligand of GRs, corticosterone (CURT), may contribute to extinction retention deficits in the SPS model. Given that CURT synthesis during fear learning is critical for fear memory consolidation and SPS enhances GR expression, CURT synthesis during fear memory formation could strengthen fear memory in SPS rats by enhancing GR activation during fear learning. In turn, this could lead to cued fear extinction retention deficits. We tested the hypothesis that CURT synthesis during fear learning leads to cued fear extinction retention deficits in SPS rats by administering the CURT synthesis inhibitor metyrapone to SPS and control rats prior to fear conditioning, and observed the effect this had on extinction memory. Inhibiting CURT synthesis during fear memory formation in control rats tended to decrease cued freezing, though this effect never reached statistical significance. Contrary to our hypothesis, inhibiting CURT synthesis during fear memory formation disrupted extinction retention in SPS rats. This finding suggests that even though SPS exposure leads to cued fear extinction memory deficits, CURT synthesis during fear memory formation enhances extinction retention in SPS rats. This suggests that stress-induced CURT synthesis in previously stressed rats can be beneficial. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We tested a rare sample of subjects (N = 4) with unprecedented focal bilateral BLA lesions due to a genetic condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease. In a classical delay fear conditioning experiment, these subjects showed impaired acquisition of conditioned fear relative to a group of matched control subjects (N = 10) as measured by fear-potentiation of the defensive eye-blink startle reflex. After the experiment, the BLA-damaged cases showed normal declarative memory of the conditioned association.

When positive, such error causes increments in associative strength and, when negative, such error causes decrements in associative strength. Prediction error can act directly on fear learning by determining the effectiveness of the aversive unconditioned stimulus or indirectly by determining the effectiveness, or associability, of the conditioned stimulus. Evidence from a variety of experimental preparations in human and non-human animals suggest that discrete neural circuits code for these actions of prediction error during fear learning. Here we review the circuits and brain regions contributing to the neural coding of prediction error during fear learning and highlight areas of research (safety learning, extinction, and reconsolidation) that may profit from this approach to understanding learning.

This two-phased reconsolidation process raises the prospect to directly target excessive fear memory as opposed to the formation of inhibitory memory following extinction training. In our previous studies, we convincingly demonstrated that 40 mg propranolol HCI administration before or after memory reactivation eliminated the emotional expression of fear memory indexed by the fear potentiated startle reflex. To apply this procedure in clinical practice it is important to understand the optimal and boundary conditions of this procedure. As part of a large project aimed at unraveling putative boundary conditions of disrupting reconsolidation of associative fear memory with propranolol HCI, we again tested our memory reconsolidation procedure. Participants (N = 44) underwent a three-day differential fear conditioning procedure. Twenty-four hours after fear acquisition, participants received 40 mg propranolol HCI prior to memory reactivation. The next day, participants were subjected to extinction training and reinstatement testing. In sharp contrast to our previous findings, propranolol HCI before memory reactivation did not attenuate the startle fear response. Remarkably, the startle fear response even persisted during extinction training and did not show the usually observed gradual decline in conditioned physiological responding (startle potentiation and skin conductance) upon repeated unreinforced trials. We discuss these unexpected findings and propose some potential explanations. It remains, however, unclear why we observed a resistance to reduce conditioned fear responding by either disrupting reconsolidation or extinction training. The present results underscore that the success of human fear conditioning research may depend on subtle manipulations and instructions.","[Bos, Marieke Geerte Nynke; Beckers, Tom; Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 AX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bos, Marieke Geerte Nynke; Beckers, Tom; Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, NL-1018 AX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beckers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Kindt, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Weesperpl 4,Room 5-11, NL-1018 AX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.kindt@uva.nl,"Beckers, Tom/C-6164-2008","Beckers, Tom/0000-0002-9581-1505; Bos, Marieke/0000-0003-1632-9217",Vici grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [453-07-006]; Vidi grant from NWO [452-09-001],"This study was funded by a Vici grant (Merel Kindt, #453-07-006) from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).

Admittance to an animal shelter is a stressful experience for dogs, and aggression is often used as a criterion by shelters for precluding opportunities for adoption. We, therefore, examined whether a program of enrichment centered around a form of human interaction known to reduce the stress of shelter dogs would also reduce the aggression of fearful dogs and improve their general welfare. Fearful dogs displaying signs of aggression, as well as dogs displaying neither fear nor aggression, either did or did not receive 30 min a day of human interaction in a secluded room for approximately the first 5 days in a shelter. We then determined the number of enriched and non-enriched fearful and non-fearful dogs that passed a standard test of dog aggression as typically implemented in this shelter to determine eligibility for adoption. We also examined the affective state of dogs in a test of cognitive bias. In two separate experiments, we found that most fearful dogs without enrichment failed the aggression test, whereas most fearful dogs undergoing enrichment completed this assessment successfully (P < 0.001 in each experiment). In contrast, nearly all non-fearful dogs passed the aggression test regardless of enrichment experience. In cognitive bias testing, enrichment reduced the latency at which fearful dogs approached two locations at which the likelihood of reinforcement was ambiguous, a measure of increased positive expectancy (P '' s < 0.01). Unexpectedly non-fearful dogs receiving enrichment approached one of the ambiguous locations more slowly than non-enriched controls (P < 0.05), a finding that might be an artifact of the testing procedures used here. While the generality of the results needs to be tested in other populations and shelter environments, the findings: 1) document the vulnerability of dogs exhibiting fear-induced aggression in a shelter environment; 2) demonstrate the ability of an enrichment program focusing on human interaction to reduce aggressiveness in these dogs and thereby increase their chances of being offered for adoption; and, 3) indicate a more-general outcome of the enrichment procedure on the affective state of fearful dogs.","[Willen, Regina M.] HaloK9Behavior, Xenia, OH 45385 USA; [Schiml, Patricia A.; Hennessy, Michael B.] Wright State Univ, Dept Psychol, Dayton, OH 45435 USA",,"Hennessy, MB (corresponding author), Wright State Univ, Dept Psychol, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",michael.hennessy@wright.edu,"Hennessy, Michael/AAH-9642-2019",,WALTHAM Foundation,"The authors thank Arielle Stephenson, Logan Riffle, and Cindy Stringer for assistance on the project, Emily Dudley for suggesting the cognitive bias test, and Mark Kumpf (Director), Estelle Johnson and Mick Sagester (Managers), and the staff of the Montgomery County Animal Resource Center for their generous continued support.

At the same time, and by providing an overview of correlates of fear of cybercrime, we aim to provide a fertile ground for theory building specific to the online context. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, yielding a total of 28 relevant studies from a range of (sub)disciplines, using a variety of measures in terms of the particular emotion measured (fear, worry, anxiety) and the type of cybercrime it related to. We find considerable agreement between studies on classic fear of crime indicators such as gender, victimization and risk perception.

Fear is a defensive mechanism evolved to protect animals from danger by balancing the animals' needs for primary resources with the risk of predation, and the amygdala is implicated in mediating fear responses. However, the functions of fear and amygdala in foraging behavior are not well characterized because of the technical difficulty in quantifying prey-predator interaction with real (unpredictable) predators. Thus, the present study investigated the rat's foraging behavior in a seminaturalistic environment when confronted with a predator-like robot programmed to surge toward the animal seeking food. Rats initially fled into the nest and froze (demonstrating fear) and then cautiously approached and seized the food as a function of decreasing nest-food and increasing food-robot distances. The likelihood of procuring food increased and decreased via lesioning/inactivating and disinhibiting the amygdala, respectively. These results indicate that the amygdala bidirectionally regulates risk behavior in rats foraging in a dynamic fear environment.","[Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Program Neurobiol & Behav, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Choi, June-Seek] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul 136701, South Korea",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,"Kim, Jeansok/0000-0001-7964-106X","Korean governmentKorean Government [MEST 2009-008145]; Ministry of Education, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea [2009K001284]; Republic of Korea; Seoul Broadcasting System Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH64457]; James McKeen Cattell Sabbatical Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH064457] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Paul E.

The effective communication of the risks associated with e-cigarettes is an important part of current work to control their usage, and the use of fear appeals is an effective method to achieve good control. Based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) and Appraisal-Tendency Framework (ATF), this article presents a 2 x 2 control experiment to test the impact of fear appeals on the perception of risk, emotions, and behavioral motivation of young people aged 35 and less. A total of 333 valid samples of adolescents and young adults were included to investigate the different response paths to fear appeals among young people of different age, sex and smoking history. The results show that high-threat, high-efficacy fear appeals are able to: (1) significantly increase young people's perception of the e-cigarette-associated threats, (2) trigger fear and anger amongst young people, and (3) stimulate their self-protection motivation. Fear appeals do not have an impact on young people's perception of efficacy, regardless of their level of threat and efficacy. High fear appeals can also increase young people's perception of threat, which in turn enhances their anger and protection motivation. Furthermore, while this type of fear appeal can enhance young women's perception of efficacy, it cannot enhance the perception of e-cigarette risks in adolescents, young men and young smokers, regardless of their level of threat and efficacy.

Sleep, especially rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), has been considered a contributing factor to the development of PTSD symptoms through its effects on the processing of emotional memories. However, it remains unknown if sex and sex hormones play a role in the hypothesized impact of sleep on the development of PTSD. Animal models have methodological advantages over human studies in investigating this research question; however, animal models of sleep in PTSD have been tested only with males. C57BL/6 mice (7 males and 15 females) were exposed to 15 footshocks in a footshock chamber, and 5 min after the last footshock, were returned to their home cages for telemetric electroencephalographic sleep recording. Nine to thirteen days later, mice were returned to the footshock chamber for 10 min without footshocks. Fear recall rates were computed by comparing freezing behaviors in the footshock chamber immediately after the footshocks to those during fear context reexposure. Males had significantly lower recall rates compared to metestrous females (that received footshocks on metestrus). Overall, males slept more than both proestrous females (that received footshocks on proestrus) and metestrous females during the dark period. Regression analyses revealed that average REMS episode durations after footshocks were differentially associated with recall rates across groups, such that the association was positive in males, but negative in proestrous females. Results suggest that both sex and the estrous cycle modulate the associations between REMS continuity and fear memory consolidation.","[Kobayashi, Ihori; Hatcher, Mark; Wilson, Camille; Boadi, Linda; Poindexter, Milan; Allard, Joanne S.; Polston, Eva K.] Howard Univ, Coll Med, 520 W St, Washington, DC 20059 USA",,"Polston, EK (corresponding author), Howard Univ, Coll Med, 520 W St, Washington, DC 20059 USA.",epolston@howard.edu,"Kobayashi, Ihori/AAU-8556-2020","Kobayashi, Ihori/0000-0003-0024-9976","HUCM Bridge Funds; Pilot Study Award [U400045]; Faculty Seed Award [U400022]; NIMH Mentored Research Scientist Award [K01MH110647]; NCATSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [KL2TR001432-01, UL1TR001409]; NIH RCMIUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [G12MD00759727]","We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Dr. Kebreten Manaye for providing access to the fear conditioning footshock chambers and software used for administration of the footshock stimuli.

Exposure to sweat produced in a fear-inducing context triggers in its receivers a simulacrum of this emotional state, as evidenced by increased medial frontalis and corrugator supercilii (facial electromyography; fEMG) activity - two facial muscles involved in the display of fear facial expressions. However, despite the increased interest in the effects of emotional sweat, little is known about the properties of these chemical sweat samples. The goal of this study was to examine whether a second application of the same sweat sample would yield reliable results. Specifically, we assessed whether sweat samples collected from Portuguese males (N = 8) in fear (vs. neutral)-inducing contexts would produce similar fEMG activations (i.e., in the medial frontalis and corrugator supercilii) in female receivers (N = 60) across two independent applications (the first with Dutch and the second with Portuguese receivers). Our findings showed that exposure to fear (vs. neutral) sweat resulted in higher activation of both muscles compared with neutral odors, revealing a similar data pattern across the two applications and underlining the feasibility of reusing emotional sweat samples. The implications of these findings for properties of these sweat volatiles are discussed.","[Gomes, Nuno; Semin, Gun R.] ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim do Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva, Fabio] Univ Aveiro, William James Ctr Res, Dept Educ & Psychol, Aveiro, Portugal; [Semin, Gun R.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Semin, GR (corresponding author), ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim do Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal.; Semin, GR (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands.",gun.r.semin@gmail.com,"; Semin, Gun/J-4046-2013","Gomes, Nuno/0000-0002-0545-607X; Semin, Gun/0000-0002-5304-5566","Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/116653/2016, IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001]; European Union Horizon 2020 Program under the project POTION-Promoting Social Interaction through Emotional Body Odors [824153]",NG and GRS gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (grant ref: SFRH/BD/116653/2016 to NG; and grant ref: IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001 to GRS).

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that regions involved in the acquisition of fear support the generalization of fear to stimuli that are similar to a learned threat, but vary in fear intensity value. Behaviorally, subjects retrospectively misidentified a learned threat as a more intense stimulus and expressed greater skin conductance responses (SCR) to generalized stimuli of high intensity. Brain activity related to intensity-based fear generalization was observed in the striatum, insula, thalamus/periacqueductal gray, and subgenual cingulate cortex. The psychophysiological expression of generalized fear correlated with amygdala activity, and connectivity between the amygdala and extrastriate visual cortex was correlated with individual differences in trait anxiety. These findings reveal the brain regions and functional networks involved in flexibly responding to stimuli that resemble a learned threat. These regions may comprise an intensity-based fear generalization circuit that underlies retrospective biases in threat value estimation and overgeneralization of fear in anxiety disorders.

A defense mode observed at intermediate threat levels is freezing: a cessation of locomotion that is characterized by a parasympathetically dominated autonomic nervous system response that causes heart rate deceleration, or fear bradycardia. Studies in rodents have shown that freezing depends on amygdalar projections to the periaqueductal grey (PAG). In humans, freezing-like behaviors are implicated in development and maintenance of psychopathology, but neural mechanisms underlying freezing or its characteristic autonomic response profile have not been identified. Here, we combined event-related blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) with autonomic response measures in a picture viewing paradigm to probe activity and interconnectivity within the amygdala-PAG pathway and test for an association with parasympathetic as opposed to sympathetic activation. In response to negatively arousing pictures, we observed parasympathetic (bradycardia) and sympathetic (pupil dilation) autonomic responses, BOLD responses in the amygdala and PAG, and effective connectivity between these regions. Critically, BOLD responses in the PAG to negative pictures correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with bradycardia but not pupil dilation. This correlation with bradycardia remained significant when partialling out pupil dilation. Additionally, activity in regions associated with motor planning and inhibition mirrored the PAG response. Thus, our findings implicate the human PAG in a parasympathetically dominated defense mode that subserves a state of attentive immobility. Mechanistic insight into this qualitatively distinct defense mode may importantly advance translational models of anxiety disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

These pictures were projected in real size on a wall of the test pen by means of a slide projector. Twenty-six behavioural items related to fear were recorded. Furthermore, fearfulness scores were calculated to compare the overall fear levels of the subjects when confronted with the photographic images. We hypothesized that ii animals recognized a man or a sheep in the presented slides, fear reactions would be enhanced in the presence of the picture of a human and reduced in the presence of a sheep picture as compared with the control situation. Our results suggest that ewes may be able to recognize the sheep picture as a conspecific. For example, sniffings were primarily directed towards the anogenital region and the head. The reduced fear reactions of isolated ewes in the presence of a sheep picture is similar to that observed previously in the presence of real conspecifics. In contrast, they did not differ when sheep were confronted with a human or a control image, indicating that additional stimuli may be needed for the human image to be fear-eliciting.","INRA, CTR TOURS NOUZILLY, ETUD COMPORTEMENT ANIM LAB, F-37380 NOUZILLY, FRANCE",,,,,,,,,43,21,21,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-6357,1872-8308,,BEHAV PROCESS,Behav.

While NMDARs mediate opposite effects on medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons and excitatory neurons. NMDAR antagonists trigger profound cortical activation. The objectives of the present study were to determine the involvement of NMDARs expressed specifically in excitatory neurons in mPFC-dependent adaptive behaviors, specifically fear discrimination and fear extinction. To achieve this, we tested mice with locally deleted Grin1 gene encoding the obligatory NR1 subunit of the NMDAR from prefrontal CamKII alpha positive neurons for their ability to distinguish frequency modulated (FM) tones in fear discrimination test. We demonstrated that NMDAR-dependent signaling in the mPFC is critical for effective fear discrimination following initial generalization of conditioned fear. While mice with deficient NMDARs in prefrontal excitatory neurons maintain normal responses to a dangerous fear-conditioned stimulus, they exhibit abnormal generalization decrement. These studies provide evidence that NMDAR-dependent neural signaling in the mPFC is a component of a neural mechanism for disambiguating the meaning of fear signals and supports discriminative fear learning by retaining proper gating information, viz both dangerous and harmless cues. We also found that selective deletion of NMDARs from excitatory neurons in the mPFC leads to a deficit in fear extinction of auditory conditioned stimuli. These studies suggest that prefrontal NMDARs expressed in excitatory neurons are involved in adaptive behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It has been observed that fear conditioning depends on stimulus salience and subject vulnerability to fear. It is further known that the prevalence of dental-related fear and phobia is exceedingly high in the population. Dental phobia is unique as no other body part is associated with a specific phobia. Therefore, we hypothesized that painful dental stimuli exhibit an enhanced susceptibility to fear conditioning when comparing to equal perceived stimuli applied to other body sites. Differential susceptibility to pain-related fear was investigated by analyzing responses to an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) applied to the right maxillary canine (UCS-c) vs. the right tibia (UCS-t). For fear conditioning, UCS-c and USC-t consisted of painful electric stimuli, carefully matched at both application sites for equal intensity and quality perception. UCSs were paired to simple geometrical forms which served as conditioned stimuli (CS+). Unpaired CS+ were presented for eliciting and analyzing conditioned fear responses. Outcome parameter were (1) skin conductance changes and (2) time-dependent brain activity (BOLD responses) in fear-related brain regions such as the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. A preferential susceptibility of dental pain to fear conditioning was observed, reflected by heightened skin conductance responses and enhanced time-dependent brain activity (BOLD responses) in the fear network. For the first time, this study demonstrates fear-related neurobiological mechanisms that point toward a superior conditionability of tooth pain. Beside traumatic dental experiences our results offer novel evidence that might explain the high prevalence of dental-related fears in the population.","[Meier, Michael L.; de Matos, Nuno M.

Therefore, there is substantial scientific and medical interest in its potential therapeutic use for the treatment of psychopathologies associated with anxiety, fear, and social dysfunctions, such as generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder, as well as autism and schizophrenia, among others. Focusing on preclinical studies, we review the existing evidence for the regulatory capacity of OXT to fine-tune general and social anxiety-related behaviors, as well as cued and social fear conditioning from a translational perspective. The available evidence from animal and human studies substantiates the hypothesis of an imbalance of the endogenous brain OXT system in the etiology of anxiety disorders, particularly those with a social component such as social anxiety disorder. In addition, such an imbalance of the OXT system is also likely to be the consequence of chronic OXT treatment resulting in a dose-dependent reduction in OXT receptor availability and increased anxiety.","[Neumann, Inga D.; Slattery, David A.] Univ Regensburg, Dept Behav & Mol Neurobiol, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany",,"Neumann, ID (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Behav & Mol Neurobiol, Univ Str 31, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",inga.neumann@ur.de,,"Slattery, David/0000-0001-8753-5005",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und ForschungFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Elitenetwork of Bavaria; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG),"This work was supported by the European Research Council, Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Elitenetwork of Bavaria (IDN), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (IDN, DAS).",,117,242,246,5,111,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

In both rodents and humans, BDNF has been implicated in hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning and memory and has more recently been linked to fear extinction processes. Fifty-nine healthy participants, genotyped for the functional BDNFval66met polymorphism, underwent a fear conditioning and 24h-delayed extinction protocol while skin conductance and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses (functional magnetic resonance imaging) were acquired. We present the first report of neural activation pattern during fear acquisition 'and' extinction for the BDNFval66met polymorphism using a differential conditioned stimulus (CS)+ > CS- comparison. During conditioning, we observed heightened allele dose-dependent responses in the amygdala and reduced responses in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in BDNFval66met met-carriers. During early extinction, 24h later, we again observed heightened responses in several regions ascribed to the fear network in met-carriers as opposed to val-carriers (insula, amygdala, hippocampus), which likely reflects fear memory recall. No differences were observed during late extinction, which likely reflects learned extinction. Our data thus support previous associations of the BDNFval66met polymorphism with neural activation in the fear and extinction network, but speak against a specific association with fear extinction processes.","[Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Haaker, Jan] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Golkar, Armita; Lindstrom, Kara M.; Haaker, Jan; Ohman, Arne; Ingvar, Martin] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Golkar, Armita; Ohman, Arne; Ingvar, Martin] Stockholm Brain Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Schalling, Martin] Karolinska Inst, Dept Mol Med & Surg, Neurogenet Sect, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Schalling, Martin] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Ctr Mol Med, Solna, Sweden",,"Lonsdorf, TB (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",t.lonsdorf@uke.de,"Lonsdorf, Tina/K-8657-2017; Schalling, Martin/F-1518-2015; Haaker, Jan/J-4670-2014","Schalling, Martin/0000-0001-5011-2922; Haaker, Jan/0000-0001-8366-9559; Ingvar, Martin/0000-0002-9041-5714; Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846; Golkar, Armita/0000-0003-3077-0391",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Karolinska InstitutetKarolinska Institutet; Stockholm County Concil; Karolinska University HospitalKarolinska Institutet; Hjarnfonden (Swedish Brain Foundation);  [SFB TRR58],"The authors thank the KIgene core facility at the Center for Molecular Medicine (CMM).

We therefore predicted that individual differences in the capacity to regulate serotonergic transmission in the human neural fear circuit would be inversely related to fear conditioning. The capacity to regulate serotonergic transmission was indexed by serotonin transporter availability measured with [C-11]-DASB positron emission tomography. Results indicate that lower serotonin transporter availability in the amygdala, insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex predicts enhanced conditioned autonomic fear responses.

Yet, recent findings in rodents have challenged the notion that contextual fear retention is initially generalized. The context-specificity of a cued fear memory to the learning context has not been addressed in the human literature largely due to limitations in methodology. Here we adapt a novel technology to test the context-specificity of cued fear conditioning using full immersion 3-D virtual reality (VR). During acquisition training, healthy participants navigated through virtual environments containing dynamic snake and spider conditioned stimuli (CSs), one of which was paired with electrical wrist stimulation. During a 24-h delayed retention test, one group returned to the same context as acquisition training whereas another group experienced the CSs in a novel context. Unconditioned stimulus expectancy ratings were assayed on-line during fear acquisition as an index of contingency awareness. Skin conductance responses time-locked to CS onset were the dependent measure of cued fear, and skin conductance levels during the interstimulus interval were an index of context fear. Findings indicate that early in acquisition training, participants express contingency awareness as well as differential contextual fear, whereas differential cued fear emerged later in acquisition. During the retention test, differential cued fear retention was enhanced in the group who returned to the same context as acquisition training relative to the context shift group. The results extend recent rodent work to illustrate differences in cued and context fear acquisition and the contextual specificity of recent fear memories. Findings support the use of full immersion VR as a novel tool in cognitive neuroscience to bridge rodent models of contextual phenomena underlying human clinical disorders.","[Huff, Nicole C.; Hernandez, Jose Alba; Fecteau, Matthew E.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Psychol Neurosci Dept, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Zielinski, David J.; Brady, Rachael] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Labar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Box 90999,B247 LSRC Bldg,Res Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",klabar@duke.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [F32 MH078471, RO1 DA027802]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA027802] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors wish to thank Christian Paret for assistance with scoring the skin conductance data.

However, the link between the two features of this disorder is not well understood. In order to probe the brain basis of aberrant extinction learning in PTSD, we administered a multimodal classical fear conditioning/extinction paradigm that incorporated affectively relevant information from two sensory channels (visual and tactile) while participants underwent fMRI scanning. The sample consisted of fifteen OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD. In response to conditioned cues and contextual information, greater avoidance symptomatology was associated with greater activation in amygdala, hippocampus, vmPFC, dmPFC, and insula, during both fear acquisition and fear extinction. Heightened responses to previously conditioned stimuli in individuals with more severe PTSD could indicate a deficiency in safety learning, consistent with PTSD symptomatology. The close link between avoidance symptoms and fear circuit activation suggests that this symptom cluster may be a key component of fear extinction deficits in PTSD and/or may be particularly amenable to change through extinction-based therapies.","[Sripada, Rebecca K.; Liberzon, Israel] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sripada, Rebecca K.] Vet Affairs Ctr Clin Management Res, Dept Vet Affairs Healthcare Syst, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Garfinkel, Sarah N.] Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",,"Sripada, RK (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, 4250 Plymouth Rd,2702 Rachel Upjohn Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rekaufma@umich.edu,,"Liberzon, Israel/0000-0002-4990-556X; Sripada, Rebecca/0000-0002-2844-3458; Garfinkel, Sarah/0000-0002-5961-1012",Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research [U028028]; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R24 MH075999]; Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center [W81XWH-08-2-0208],"The research reported in this article was supported by grants from the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (U028028) to SG, from the National Institute of Mental Health (R24 MH075999) to IL, and from the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (W81XWH-08-2-0208) to IL.",,69,44,45,0,37,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,,,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

Human studies on such reinstatement processes are still inconclusive. Some revealed a general increase of fear reactions, both to the fear (CS+) and the safety stimulus (CS-), whereas other studies discovered a differential return of fear with enhanced fear responses to the CS+ only. Moreover, we know little about reinstatement of contextual anxiety, a state of general anxious apprehension and chronic worry. Therefore, the present study investigated reinstatement of contextual anxiety with an ecological valid virtual reality (VR) design. Additionally, we examined whether the current state anxiety might modulate the reinstatement of contextual anxiety. To this end, two groups underwent context conditioning on Day 1, i.e., one context (CXT+) became paired with unpredictable USs, but not the other context (CXT-), and an extinction training on Day 2. On Day 3 a reinstatement test was conducted, i.e., one group (reinstatement group, n = 21) received one unsignaled US before testing, whereas the control group (n = 21) did not. Only the reinstatement group showed a differential return of contextual anxiety as measured by fear-potentiated startle and anxiety ratings. Interestingly, the reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle was additionally influenced by state anxiety. Conclusively, an anxious state before an unsignaled aversive event might favor a return of contextual anxiety. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, recalling traumatic memories can induce re-experiencing the trauma, thus resulting in a maladaptive fear. A failure to properly regulate fear responses has been associated with anxiety disorders, like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Thus, re-establishing the capability to regulate fear has an important role for its adaptive and clinical relevance. Strategies aimed at erasing fear memories have been proposed, although there are limits about their efficiency in treating anxiety disorders. To re-establish fear regulation, here we propose a new approach, based on the re-evaluation of the aversive value of traumatic experience. Mice were submitted to a contextual-fear-conditioning paradigm in which a neutral context was paired with an intense electric footshock. Three weeks after acquisition, conditioned mice were treated with a less intense footshock (pain threshold). The effectiveness of this procedure in reducing fear expression was assessed in terms of behavioral outcomes related to PTSD (e.g., hyper-reactivity to a neutral tone, anxiety levels in a plus maze task, social avoidance, and learning deficits in a spatial water maze) and of amygdala activity by evaluating c-fos expression. Furthermore, a possible role of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (IOFC) in mediating the behavioral effects induced by the re-evaluation procedure was investigated. We observed that this treatment: (i) significantly mitigates the abnormal behavioral outcomes induced by trauma; (ii) persistently attenuates fear expression without erasing contextual memory; (iii) prevents fear reinstatement; (iv) reduces amygdala activity; and (v) requires an intact IOFC to be effective. These results suggest that an effective strategy to treat pathological anxiety should address cognitive re-evaluation of the traumatic experience mediated by IOFC.","[Costanzi, Marco; Saraulli, Daniele; Cannas, Sara; D'Alessandro, Francesca; Cestari, Vincenzo] CNR IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, IBCN, Rome, Italy; [Costanzi, Marco; D'Alessandro, Francesca] Libera Univ Maria SS, Dept Human Sci, Rome, Italy; [Saraulli, Daniele; Rossi-Arnaud, Clelia; Cestari, Vincenzo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Psychol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Florenzano, Fulvio] EBRI, Confocal Microscopy Unit, Rome, Italy; [Cestari, Vincenzo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Daniel Bovet Ctr, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,"Cestari, V (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Psychol, Via Marsi 78, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",vincenzo.cestari@uniroma1.it,"ROSSI-ARNAUD, Clelia/J-7870-2019","ROSSI-ARNAUD, Clelia/0000-0001-5006-6583; Cestari, Vincenzo/0000-0002-9623-157X",LUMSA; Guardia di Finanza-Italian Ministry of Economy,"We thank R W.

Animal models of reinstatement commonly utilize a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure, in which subjects are first trained to fear a conditional stimulus (CS) by pairing it with an aversive unconditional stimulus (US), and then extinguished by repeated presentations of the CS alone. Reinstatement is typically induced by exposing subjects to an aversive US after extinction, but here we show that exposure to a non-extinguished CS can reinstate conditional fear responding to an extinguished CS, a phenomenon we refer to as conditional reinstatement (CRI). Rats were trained to fear two CSs (light and tone) and subsequently underwent extinction training to only one CS (counterbalanced). Presenting the unextinguished CS (but not a novel cue) immediately after extinction reinstated conditional fear responding to the extinguished CS in a test session given 24 h later. These findings indicate that reinstatement of extinguished fear can be triggered by exposure to conditional as well as unconditional aversive stimuli, and this may help to explain why relapse is common following clinical extinction therapy in humans. Further study of CRI using animal models may prove useful for developing refined extinction therapies that are more resistant to reinstatement.","[Halladay, Lindsay R.; Zelikowsky, Moriel; Blair, Hugh T.; Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Halladay, LR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",lrhalladay@ucla.edu,"Halladay, Lindsay/AAC-9950-2020","Halladay, Lindsay/0000-0003-2232-6709; Zelikowsky, Moriel/0000-0002-0465-9027; Blair, Hugh/0000-0001-8256-5109",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5 T32 NS058280-03]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [RO1 MH62122]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062122] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [T32NS058280] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This work was supported by NIH Grant 5 T32 NS058280-03 awarded to Lindsay R.

Two minute duration CSs were used for Day 1 fear acquisition. Participants were randomized to receive either 1, 2, or 4 min CS durations during Day 2 extinction. Extinction re-test was examined on Day 3 using the original acquisition CS duration (2 mm). Findings indicated that participants who were aware of the CS+/unconditioned stimulus (US) contingency (n = 52) develop a temporal expectation about when the unconditioned stimulus will be delivered. Although the shorter duration CS resulted in greater fear reduction during extinction, cessation of fear responding at re-test was the same for CS extinction durations ranging from half the CS acquisition duration to twice the CS acquisition duration. Thus, extinction performance did not predict extinction at re-test, which could have important implications for optimizing exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, only one human neuroimaging study of classically conditioned fear generalization has been conducted, and the neural substrates of this clinically germane process remain largely unknown. The current generalization study employs a clinically validated generalization gradient paradigm, modified for the fMRI environment, to identify neural substrates of classically conditioned generalization that may function aberrantly in clinical anxiety. Stimuli include five rings of gradually increasing size with extreme sizes serving as cues of conditioned danger (CS+) and safety (CS-). The three intermediately sized rings serve as generalization stimuli (GSs) and create a continuum-of-size from CS+ to CS-. Results demonstrate 'positive' generalization gradients, reflected by declines in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+, in bilateral anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobule. Conversely, 'negative' gradients, reflected by inclines in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+ were instantiated in bilateral ventral hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus cortex. These results as well as those from connectivity analyses are discussed in relation to a working neurobiology of conditioned generalization centered on the hippocampus.","[Lissek, Shmuel; Reynolds, Richard C.; Grillon, Christian] NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, Intramural Res Program, NIH,DHHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lissek, Shmuel; Burton, Philip; Espensen-Sturges, Tori] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Bradford, Daniel E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Alvarez, Ruben P.] Laureate Inst Brain Res, Tulsa, OK USA",,"Lissek, S (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, 75 E River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",smlissek@umn.edu,,"Lissek, Shmuel/0000-0001-7384-371X","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K99 MH080130]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH018931, ZICMH002888, ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health and by the Extramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health (grant no.

After fear conditioning, participants underwent extinction training either 5 min or 1 day later and in either the same room (same context) or a different room (context shift). The next day, conditioned fear was tested in the original room. When extinction took place immediately, fear renewal was robust and prolonged for context-shift participants, and spontaneous recovery was observed in the same-context participants. Delayed extinction, by contrast, yielded a brief form of fear renewal that reextinguished within the testing session for context-shift participants, and there was no spontaneous recovery in the same-context participants. The authors conclude that the passage of time allows for memory consolidation processes to promote the formation of distinct yet flexible emotional memory traces that confer an ability to recall extinction, even in an alternate context, and minimize the return of fear. Furthermore, immediate extinction can yield spontaneous recovery and prolong fear renewal. These findings have potential implications for ameliorating fear relapse in anxiety disorders.","[Huff, Nicole C.; Hernandez, Jose Alba; Blanding, Nineequa Q.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Labar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",klabar@duke.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0239614]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [2 P01 NS041328, F32 MH078471]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH078471] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [P01NS041328] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported in pan by National Science Foundation CAREER award 0239614 to Kevin S.

Recently, we demonstrated that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is capable of enhancing fear memories. Here, we examined the effects of cathodal tDCS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during fear reconsolidation in humans. Methods: Seventeen young, healthy subjects were randomly assigned to two groups, which underwent fear conditioning with mild electric stimuli paired with a visual stimulus. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were shown a reminder of the conditioned fearful stimulus. Shortly thereafter, they received either tDCS (right prefrontal-cathodal, left supraorbital-anodal) for 20 min at 1 mA, or sham stimulation. A day later, fear responses of both groups were compared. Results: On Day 3, during fear response assessment, there were no significant differences between the tDCS and sham group (p > 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that cathodal tDCS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right prefrontal-cathodal, left supraorbital-anodal) did not influence fear memories.","[Mungee, Aditya; Burger, Max; Bajbouj, Malek] Charite, Dept Psychiat, Campus Benjamin Franklin, D-14050 Berlin, Germany; [Mungee, Aditya; Bajbouj, Malek] Freie Univ, Cluster Excellence Languages Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Bajbouj, Malek] Freie Univ, Dahlem Inst Neuroimaging Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",,"Mungee, A (corresponding author), Charite, Dept Psychiat, Campus Benjamin Franklin, D-14050 Berlin, Germany.; Mungee, A (corresponding author), Freie Univ, Cluster Excellence Languages Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",aditya.mungee@charite.de; max-benedict.burger@charite.de; malek.bajbouj@charite.de,"Bajbouj, Malek/B-3579-2012; Bajbouj, Malek/ABD-6241-2021","Bajbouj, Malek/0000-0002-0073-3322",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Charite Medical Neuroscience Program; DFG (German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG),"The authors would like to thank the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), Charite Medical Neuroscience Program and the DFG (German Research Foundation) funded cluster of excellence Languages of Emotion for supporting this project.

Usually, these learning experiences are modeled in the lab with pairings between a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) (i. e., fear conditioning via CS-US pairings). Nevertheless, for humans, fear learning can also be based on verbal instructions. In this review, we consider the role of verbal instructions in laboratory fear learning. Specifically, we consider both the effects of verbal instructions on fear responses in the absence of CS-US pairings as well as the way in which verbal instructions moderate fear established via CS-US pairings. We first focus on the available empirical findings about both types of effects. More specifically, we consider how these effects are moderated by elements of the fear conditioning procedure (i.e., the stimuli, the outcome measures, the relationship between the stimuli, the participants, and the broader context). Thereafter, we discuss how well different mental-process models of fear learning account for these empirical findings. Finally, we conclude the review with a discussion of open questions and opportunities for future research.","[Mertens, Gaetan; Sevenster, Dieuwke; Engelhard, Iris M.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mertens, Gaetan; De Houwer, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Univ Groningen, Dept Clin Psychol & Expt Psychopathol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Boddez, Yannick] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Mertens, G (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",g.mertens@uu.nl,"Mertens, Gatan/ABC-3386-2021; De Houwer, Jan/ABF-6866-2021","Mertens, Gatan/0000-0003-1923-6657; De Houwer, Jan/0000-0003-0488-5224",VICI grant by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [453-15-005]; KU Leuven Research CouncilKU Leuven [PF/10/005]; Belgian Science Policy Office (KU Leuven) [IUAPVII/33]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles ProgramBelgian Federal Science Policy Office [IUAPVII/33]; Ghent University Methusalem Grant [BOF16/MET_V/002],Gaetan Mertens and Iris Engelhard are supported by a VICI grant (453-15-005) awarded to Iris Engelhard by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.

Here we investigated sex differences in, and the influence of estradiol and progesterone on, fear extinction in healthy humans. Men and women underwent a two-day paradigm in which fear conditioning and extinction learning took place on day 1 and extinction recall was tested on day 2. Visual cues were used as the conditioned stimuli and a mild electric shock was used as the unconditioned stimulus. Skin conductance was recorded throughout the experiment and used to measure conditioned responses (CRs). Blood samples were obtained from all women to measure estradiol and progesterone levels. We found that higher estradiol during extinction learning enhanced subsequent extinction recall but had no effects on fear acquisition or extinction learning itself. Sex differences were only observed during acquisition, with men exhibiting significantly higher CRs. After dividing women into low- and high-estradiol groups, men showed comparable extinction recall to high-estradiol women, and both of these groups showed higher extinction recall than low-estradiol women. Therefore, sex differences in extinction memory emerged only after taking into account women's estradiol levels. Lower estradiol may impair extinction consolidation in women. These findings could have practical applications in the treatment of anxiety disorders through cognitive and behavioral therapies. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to assess: (i) gender differences in reports of global dental fear, global fear of dental pain, and specific fear of dental pain; (ii) how the wording of questions about specific fear of dental pain influences a subjective report, and (iii) the interactions between gender differences and wording effects in the reports of specific fear of dental pain. Methods: A telephonic survey of 504 adult Floridians was conducted in 2004. Data collected included six measures of specific fear of dental pain, one measure of global fear of dental pain, one measure of global dental fear, and demographic information. Results: Women were more likely to report global dental fear, global fear of dental pain, and specific fear of dental pain than men, and both women and men were more likely to report 'dread' of dental pain than 'fear' of dental pain. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that: (i) there are gender differences in reports of dental fear and fear of dental pain; and (ii) both men and women are more willing to express their fearful feelings regarding dentistry using a more socially acceptable term.","Univ Florida, Coll Dent, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg & Diagnost Sci, JHMHC, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Diagnost Sci, Birmingham, AL USA; Univ Florida, Dept Clin & Hlth Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Florida, Ctr Study Emot & Atten, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Heft, MW (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Dent, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg & Diagnost Sci, JHMHC, Box 100416, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",mwheft@ufl.edu,,,NIDCR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [DE13956] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL &CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [R01DE013956] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,36,42,44,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0301-5661,1600-0528,,COMMUNITY DENT ORAL,Community Dentist.

But although this might be crucial for practical application, the duration of daily treatment necessary to achieve this effect was not known so far. In the present experiment, we investigated whether even a minimal human contact, characteristic of animal caretaking in intensive rabbitries, can reduce avoidance. Newborn New Zealand rabbit pups were exposed to one of the following handling treatments in the first week of life: (1) full handling, within 0.5 It after nursing, which consisted of removing the pups of the nest and weighing them (about 5 min/litter), (2) full handling performed 2 h after nursing with a treatment similar to the previous, (3) routine check, within 0.5 h after nursing, which consisted of touching the pups by the stockperson to see whether all pups were alive (about 5 s/litter), (4) routine check, 2 h after nursing. At 28 days of age, the timidity of the pups was measured in a 5 min approach test. Pups that were handled within 0.5 h after nursing, irrespectively of the duration of handling, appeared to be tamer as they approached the experimenter's hand with a lower latency and more times then those handled later. We conclude that, in an apparent sensitive period, even minimal human contact is effective in reducing avoidance of the caretaker. Thus, handling might be a useful tool to reduce stress and improve welfare even under intensive farming conditions. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) advocate using neurobiological intermediate phenotypes that provide dimensional correlates of psychopathology. Negative Valence Systems in the RDoC matrix include the construct of acute threat, which can be measured on a physiological level using potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex assessed via electromyography recordings of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Impairments in extinction of fear-potentiated startle due to high levels of fear (termed fear load) during the early phases of extinction have been observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goals of the current work were to examine dimensional associations between fear-related symptoms of PTSD and fear load variables to test their validity as an intermediate phenotype. We examined extinction of fear-potentiated startle in a cohort (n = 269) of individuals with a broad range of civilian trauma exposure (range 0-13 traumatic events per person, mean = 3.5). Based on previously reported findings, we hypothesized that fear load would be significantly associated with intrusion and fear memories of an index traumatic event. The results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts (p = 0.0007) and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders (p = 0.036). Degree of adult or childhood trauma exposure, and depression severity were not associated with fear load. After controlling for age, sex, race, income, level of prior trauma, and level of fear conditioning, fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts (p = 0.004). The significance of these findings is that they support dimensional associations with symptom severity rather than diagnostic category and, as such, fear load may emerge as a transdiagnostic intermediate phenotype expressed across fear-related disorders (e.g., specific phobia, social phobia).

Inappropriate inflammation is also emerging as a risk factor for anxiety disorders, affective disorders, and trauma-and stressor-related disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized as persistent re-experiencing of the trauma after a traumatic experience. Traumatic experiences can lead to long-lasting fear memories and fear potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex. The acoustic startle reflex is an ethologically relevant reflex and can be potentiated in both humans and rats through Pavlovian conditioning. Mycobacterium vaccae is a soil-derived bacterium with immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties that has been demonstrated to enhance fear extinction in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm when given prior to fear conditioning. To determine if immunization with M. vaccae after fear conditioning also has protective effects, adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent fear conditioning on days -37 and -36 followed by immunizations (3x), once per week beginning 24 h following fear conditioning, with a heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae NCTC 11659 (0.1 mg, s.c., in 100 mu l borate-buffered saline) or vehicle, and, then, 3 weeks following the final immunization, were tested in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm (n = 12 per group). Rats underwent fear extinction training on days 1 through 6 followed by spontaneous recovery 14 days later (day 20). Rats were euthanized on day 21 and brain tissue was sectioned for analysis of Tph2, Htr1a, Slc6a4, Slc22a3, and Crhr2 mRNA expression throughout the brainstem dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Immunization with M. vaccae did not affect fear expression on day 1. However, M. vaccaeimmunized rats showed enhanced enhanced within-session fear extinction on day 1 and enhanced between session fear extinction beginning on day 2, relative to vehicle-immunized controls. Immunization with M. vaccae and fear-potentiated startle had minimal effects on serotonergic gene expression when assessed 42 days after the final immunization. Together with previous studies, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that immunoregulatory strategies, such as immunization with M. vaccae, have potential for both prevention and treatment of trauma- and stressor-related psychiatric disorders.","[Hassell, James E., Jr.; Fox, James H.; Arnold, Mathew R.; Siebler, Philip H.; Lieb, Margaret W.; Schmidt, Dominic; Spratt, Emma J.; Smith, Tessa M.; Nguyen, Kadi T.; Gates, Chloe A.; Holmes, Kaley S.; Schnabel, K'loni S.; Loupy, Kelsey M.; Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Physiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hassell, James E., Jr.; Arnold, Mathew R.; Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado, Ctr Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Erber, Maike] Univ Ulm, Clin Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Lab Mol Psychosomat, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado, Ctr Neurosci, Anschutz Med Campus, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] RMRVAMC, Vet Hlth Adm, Rocky Mt Mental Illness Res Educ & Clin Ctr MIREC, Denver, CO 80220 USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Mil & Vet Microbiome, Denver, CO 80220 USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Consortium Res & Educ MVM CoRE, Denver, CO 80220 USA",,"Lowry, CA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Physiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Lowry, CA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Ctr Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",james.hassell@colorado.edu; james.fox@colorado.edu; arnoldmr@colorado.edu; philip.siebler@colorado.edu; margaret.lieb@colorado.edu; dominic.schmidt@colorado.edu; emma.spratt@colorado.edu; tessa.smith@colorado.edu; kadi.nguyen@colorado.edu; chga8240@colorado.edu; kaley.holmes@colorado.edu; kloni.schnabel@colorado.edu; kelsey.loupy@colorado.edu; maike.erber@uni-ulm.de; christopher.lowry@colorado.edu,"Lieb, Margaret/AAP-1736-2020","Lieb, Margaret/0000-0002-3930-8921","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1R21MH116263]; Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) Award [N00014-15-1-2809]; Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development (VA-ORD) RR&D Small Projects in Rehabilitation Research (SPiRE) (121) [1 121 RX002232-01]; Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) [DCEED-3510]; Alfred P.

The current set of experiments sought to determine whether reproductive experience also alters the molecular features of fear extinction. In adult male rats, it has been widely demonstrated that the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) is essential for fear extinction. We therefore compared the involvement of NMDAR in fear extinction between nulliparous (virgin) and primiparous (reproductively experienced) female rats. Nulliparous and primiparous females received systemic administrations of either MK-801 (a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist) or saline prior to extinction training. MK-801 was found to impair extinction recall in nulliparous females, but not primiparous females. When the same dose of MK-801 was administered prior to conditioning, both groups of rats showed impaired recall of conditioning the following day. The results of these experiments indicate that the extinction, but not the acquisition of fear, may become NMDAR-independent following reproductive experience.","[Tang, Samantha; Graham, Bronwyn M.] UNSW, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,"Tang, S (corresponding author), UNSW, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",samantha.tang@unsw.edu.au,,"Graham, Bronwyn/0000-0001-6582-2273; Tang, Samantha/0000-0001-5178-3816","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE140100243, DP180101563]; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government",This work was supported by grants from the Australian Research Council (DE140100243 and DP180101563) to BMG and an Australian Postgraduate Award to ST.,,73,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JAN,2019,236,1,,,,,251,264,,10.1007/s00213-018-4956-y,,,14,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,HL4IV,WOS:000458681900018,29959460,,,,2022-04-16,

We report that genes related to the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as genes that modulate serotonergic, dopaminergic, and neuropeptidergic functions or plasticity, play a role in this context. The strong overlap of the genetic targets involved in stress and fear learning suggests that a dimensional and mechanistic model of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder based on these constructs is promising. Genome-wide genetic analyses on fear and stress mechanisms are scarce. So far, reliable replication is still lacking for most of the molecular genetic findings, and the proportion of explained variance is rather small.

PPI deficits are observed not only in patients with schizophrenia, but also in patients with anxiety disorders. Previous studies have shown that PPI in rats can be enhanced by auditory fear conditioning. In this study, we evaluated the effects of contextual fear conditioning (FC) for six times a day and fear extinction (FE) for seven days on PPI in mice. C57BL/6J mice (male, 8-12 weeks) were divided into three groups; no-FC (control), FC and FC + FE. We measured PPI at the following three time points, (I) baseline before FC, (2) after FC, and (3) after FE. The results showed that PPI was increased after FC. Moreover, the enhanced PPI following FC was observed even after FE with decreased freezing behaviors. These results suggested contextual fear conditioning could enhance acoustic PPI, and that contextual fear extinction could decrease freezing behaviors, but not acoustic PPI. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with higher risk of incident hypertension, but it is unclear whether specific aspects of PTSD are particularly cardiotoxic. PTSD is a heterogeneous disorder, comprising dimensions of fear and dysphoria. Because elevated fear after trauma may promote autonomic nervous system dysregulation, we hypothesized fear would predict hypertension onset, and associations with hypertension would be stronger with fear than dysphoria. Methods. We examined fear and dysphoria symptom dimensions in relation to incident hypertension over 24 years in 2709 trauma-exposed women in the Nurses' Health Study II. Posttraumatic fear and dysphoria symptom scores were derived from a PTSD diagnostic interview. We used proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each symptom dimension (quintiles) with new-onset hypertension events (N= 925), using separate models. We also considered lower-order symptom dimensions of fear and dysphoria. Results. Higher levels of fear (P-trend = 0.02), but not dysphoria (P-trend = 0.22), symptoms were significantly associated with increased hypertension risk after adjusting for socio-demographics and family history of hypertension. Women in the highest v. lowest fear quintile had a 26% higher rate of developing hypertension [HR = 1.26 (95% CI 1.02-1.57)]; the increased incidence associated with greater fear was similar when further adjusted for biomedical and health behavior covariates (P-trend = 0.04) and dysphoria symptoms (P-trend = 0.04). Lower-order symptom dimension analyses provided preliminary evidence that the re-experiencing and avoidance components of fear were particularly associated with hypertension. Conclusions. Fear symptoms associated with PTSD may be a critical driver of elevated cardiovascular risk in trauma-exposed individuals.","[Sumner, Jennifer A.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Behav Cardiovasc Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kubzansky, Laura D.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Boston, MA USA; [Roberts, Andrea L.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Chen, Qixuan] Columbia Univ, Dept Biostat, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Rimm, Eric B.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Channing Div Network Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rimm, Eric B.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA USA; [Rimm, Eric B.; Koenen, Karestan C.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA; [Koenen, Karestan C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Psychiat & Neurodev Genet Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Koenen, Karestan C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,"Sumner, JA (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Behav Cardiovasc Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA.",js4456@cumc.columbia.edu,,"Kubzansky, Laura/0000-0002-4039-2235; Sumner, Jennifer/0000-0002-0217-7171","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01MH078928, R01MH101269, K01HL130650, UM1CA176726]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (K.C.K., grant number R01MH078928; K.C.K. and L.D.K., grant number R01MH101269; and J.A.S., grant numbers K01HL130650; and UM1CA176726).",,53,6,6,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0033-2917,1469-8978,,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

Anxiety symptoms have emerged as potential modifiable risk factors in the time before a suicide attempt, but few studies have been conducted using laboratory measures of fear and anxiety. We operationally defined fear and anxiety as increased startle reactivity during anticipation of predictable (fear-potentiated startle) and unpredictable (anxiety-potentiated startle) shock. We hypothesized that a lifetime history of suicide attempt (as compared to history of no suicide attempt) would be associated with increased fear-potentiated startle. Methods: A post-hoc analysis of fear- and anxiety-potentiated startle was conducted in 28 medication-free patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) divided according to suicide attempt history. Results: The magnitude of fear-potentiated startle was increased in depressed patients with lifetime suicide attempts compared to those without a lifetime history of suicide attempt (F(1,26)=5.629, p=.025). There was no difference in anxiety-potentiated startle by suicide attempt history. Limitations: This is a post-hoc analysis of previously analyzed patient data from a study of depressed inpatients. Further replication of the finding with a larger patient sample is indicated. Conclusions: Increased fear-potentiated startle in suicide attempters suggests the role of amygdala in depressed patients with a suicide attempt history.

Stress modulates the acquisition and expression of fear memories and appears to promote fear recovery in patients with anxiety disorders. However, the neural correlates underlying stress hormone effects on the return of fear in humans remain unexplored. Likewise, little is known about the interactions between sex and stress hormones on return of fear phenomena. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 32 men and 32 women were exposed to a fear renewal paradigm with fear acquisition in context A and extinction in context B. On the following day, participants received either cortisol or placebo 40 min before return of fear was tested in both contexts in a renewal and reinstatement test. Cortisol increased differential conditioned skin conductance responses in the extinction context B following reinstatement in men but not in women. On the neural level, this effect was characterized by enhanced fear-related activation in the right amygdala in men, while an activation decrement in this region was observed after cortisol treatment in women. Our results revealed that cortisol promotes the return of fear in men by strengthening a key node of the fear network - the amygdala. We thereby provide novel insights into a sex-specific mechanism mediating stress-induced fear recovery which may translate into different relapse risks and treatment strategies for men and women.","[Kinner, Valerie L.; Wolf, Oliver T.; Merz, Christian J.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany",,"Wolf, OT (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",valerie.kinner@rub.de; oliver.t.wolf@rub.de; christian.j.merz@rub.de,"Merz, Christian J/I-7635-2019","Merz, Christian J/0000-0001-5679-6595; Jentsch, Valerie L./0000-0001-9318-9540; Wolf, Oliver T./0000-0002-9320-2124","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [1581, WO 733/13-2, SFB 1280]","Funding for this study was provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG; Research Unit 1581 Extinction Learning; Project P5 (WO 733/13-2) and SFB 1280 Extinction Learning; Project A09 (OTW, CJM)).

Yet fear effects are not always the predominant driver of predator-prey interactions. Thus, guiding ecological principles have not been assembled to explain the broader food web interactions that shape the context dependency of carnivore-livestock conflict. We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework as a way to think about the contingencies under which inducing non-consumptive 'fear effects' on predators would be effective to mitigate carnivore-livestock conflict. The framework specifically considers interactions among wildlife (carnivore predators, wild ungulate prey) and humans (people and livestock) in terms of spatial predator-prey assemblages in which the nature of wildlife-human interactions - as either a carnivore-livestock conflict or a coexistence food web - is contingent on the nature of spatial movement and overlap of humans and wildlife across landscapes. Considering human-wildlife interactions within such a spatial food web context can assist in enabling people and wildlife, especially imperiled carnivores, to coexist in human-modified landscapes.

We use survey data from Nepal during the armed conflict (1996-2006) to examine how trauma, sex and gender, age, marriage, and household size affect fear of violence. We also disaggregate types of worry, and find substantial variance on whether respondents were more concerned about livelihood consequences of conflict than physical danger. We supplement quantitative analyses with discussion of in-depth interviews from the study area on these same topics. Overall, our results highlight the enduring impact of gender roles in Nepal and that conflict might disproportionately affect those who are already vulnerable and have greater social responsibilities. This article provides a unique comparison between fear of violence during armed conflict in a low-income country to the fear of crime literature based in high-income countries.","[Williams, Nathalie E.] Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Box 353340, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Williams, Nathalie E.] Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Box 353340, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ghimire, Dirgha] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Populat Studies Ctr, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Snedker, Karen A.] Seattle Pacific Univ, Dept Sociol, 3307 Third Ave West,Suite 210, Seattle, WA 98119 USA",,"Williams, NE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Box 353340, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Williams, NE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Box 353340, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",natw@uw.edu; nepdjg@umich.edu; snedker@spu.edu,,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R00HD067587, R24HD042828, R24 HD041028]; University of Michigan Population Studies Center; University of Michigan Global Health Research and Training Initiative [5 R25 TW007496-03]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R24HD041028, R24HD042828, R00HD067587, P2CHD041028, P2CHD042828] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R25TW007496] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was supported by generous grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, including a research grant (R00HD067587), research infrastructure grants (R24HD042828 and R24 HD041028) to the Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology at the University of Washington and the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan, from the University of Michigan Population Studies Center (Small Grant Program), and the University of Michigan Global Health Research and Training Initiative (Grant #5 R25 TW007496-03).

Interestingly, clinical evidence suggests that novelty seeking is a good predictor for vulnerability to the development of excessive and persistent fear. Here, we first tested this hypothesis by analyzing contextual and cued fear responses of rats selected for their high (high responders, HR) or low (low responders, LR) exploration of a novel environment, indicator of novelty seeking. While HR and LR rats exhibited similar sensitivity to the shock and cued fear memory retention, fewer extinction sessions were required in HR than LR animals to reach extinction, indicating faster contextual and cued memory extinction. In a second part, we found an effective disruption of contextual fear reconsolidation by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, associated with a down-regulation of early growth response 1 (Egr1) in the hippocampal CA1 area, and up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA levels in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices. Altogether, these data demonstrate a link between novelty seeking and conditioned fear extinction, and highlight a promising novel role of ketamine in affecting established fear memory.

We focus on two different types of fears of punishment, fear of being punished for presenting new ideas and for bending organizational rules. Employing Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing data from 1,189 participants in the 2015 survey of National Administrative Studies Project Citizen, we test hypotheses about possible differences in fear of punishment according to sector (government vs. business), general risk propensity, views about coworkers, job clarity, gender, and whether respondents are members of an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority. Using nested robust regression models, we find that the two different types of fear of punishment are predicted by different variables. Sector has no bearing on fear of punishment for presenting new ideas but is a major predictor of differences in fear of bending the rules, with government employees being more fearful. While gender has no significant effects, being a racial minority is closely related to fear of presenting new ideas. Having a negative view of one's fellow workers, particularly one's supervisor, is associated with greater fear of punishment from both rule bending and presenting new ideas. Those with a clear organization mission and job clarity are less likely to be afraid of punishment for proposing innovative ideas but not necessarily for bending rules. We suggest that the results have implications for managerial practice and human resource reform.","[Jung, Jiwon; Bozeman, Barry; Gaughan, Monica] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Org Res & Design, 411 North Cent Ave,Suite 480, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Jung, Jiwon] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Bozeman, Barry] Arizona State Univ, Sci & Technol Policy & Publ Management, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Bozeman, Barry] Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",,"Bozeman, B (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Ctr Org Res & Design, 411 North Cent Ave,Suite 480, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",bbozeman@asu.edu,,"Jung, Jiwon/0000-0002-8353-212X",,,,86,6,6,5,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0095-3997,1552-3039,,ADMIN SOC,Adm.

Compelling experimental human evidence for this theory is yet to be obtained. We report the clearest test to date by investigating the effects of 1 and 2 mg of the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam on the intensity of threat-avoidance behavior in 40 healthy adult volunteers (20 females). We found lorazepam modulated the intensity of participants' threat-avoidance behavior in a dose-dependent manner. However, the pattern of effects depended upon two factors: type of threat-avoidance behavior and theoretically relevant measures of personality. In the case of flight behavior (one-way active avoidance), lorazepam increased intensity in low scorers on the Fear Survey Schedule tissue-damage fear but reduced it in high scorers. Conversely, in the case of risk-assessment behavior (two-way active avoidance), lorazepam reduced intensity in low scorers on the Spielberger trait anxiety but increased it in high scorers. Anti-anxiety drugs do not systematically affect rodent flight behavior; therefore, we interpret this new finding as suggesting that lorazepam has a broader effect on defense in humans than in rodents, perhaps by modulating general perceptions of threat intensity. The different patterning of lorazepam effects on the two behaviors implies that human perceptions of threat intensity are nevertheless distributed across two different neural streams, which influence effects observed on one-way or two-way active avoidance demanded by the situation.","[Perkins, A.

In these experiments, rats are trained to fear an initially neutral stimulus by pairing that stimulus with shock. The amount of fear elicited by the stimulus [i.e., now a conditioned stimulus (CS)] is later assessed by presenting startle-eliciting noise bursts both in the presence and also the absence of the CS. After training, startle responses are typically greater in the presence of the CS. Findings reviewed here suggest that amygdala N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a key role in triggering the neural changes that support fear learning and also the loss of fear that accompanies extinction training. Amygdala(+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors also participate in fear learning. However, unlike NNMA receptor antagonists, AMPA receptor antagonists also block fear-potentiated startle when infused prior to testing. Very recent data indicate that glutamate metabotropic Group II receptor agonists also block fear learning when infused into the amygdala prior to training, and block fear-potentiated startle when infused prior to testing. A fuller understanding of the role of amygdala glutamate systems in fear and fear learning may suggest novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of clinical anxiety disorders.

In Studies 1, 2 and 3, we experimentally manipulated group size in hypothetical and real-world situations and found that fear responses decreased as group size increased. In Studies 4 and 5 we again used a combination of hypothetical and real-world decisions to test whether increased anxiety in response to a potential threat would lead participants to choose larger groups for themselves.

Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia, fear avoidance beliefs, or pain anxiety, pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied multiple kernel learning approach allowed the generation of models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of nonoverlapping neural predictors within fear-processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.","[Meier, Michael Lukas; Vrana, Andrea; Humphreys, Barry Kim; Schweinhardt, Petra] Balgrist Univ Hosp, Dept Chiropract Med, Integrat Spinal Res, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seifritz, Erich; Stampfli, Philipp] Univ Zurich, Hosp Psychiat, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stampfli, Philipp] Univ Zurich, Psychiat Hosp, MR Ctr, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schweinhardt, Petra] McGill Univ, Alan Edwards Ctr Res Pain, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Meier, ML (corresponding author), Balgrist Campus,Lengghalde 5, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",Michael.meier@balgrist.ch,"Schweinhardt, Petra/AAC-6797-2021","Schweinhardt, Petra/0000-0003-4837-6595; Stampfli, Philipp/0000-0003-1684-2416; Meier, Michael/0000-0001-6004-8338","Foundation for the Education of Chiropractors; Balgrist Foundation, Switzerland","This work was supported by the Foundation for the Education of Chiropractors and the Balgrist Foundation, Switzerland.",,92,5,5,0,4,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,2373-2822,,ENEURO,eNeuro,NOV-DEC,2018,5,6,,,,,,,UNSP e0107-18.2018,10.1523/ENEURO.0107-18.2018,,,15,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,HJ1CF,WOS:000456898800004,30627654,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-04-16,

This process, known as fear generalization, facilitates the avoidance of danger, and dysregulations in this process play an important role in anxiety disorders. Oxytocin (OT) has been shown to modulate fear learning, yet effects on fear generalization remain unknown. Methods We employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subject design during which healthy male participants received either intranasal OT or placebo (PLC) following fear acquisition and before fear generalization with concomitant acquisition of skin conductance responses (SCRs). Twenty-four to 72 h before the fear learning and immediately after the fear generalization task, participants additionally complete a discrimination threshold task. Results Relative to PLC, OT significantly reduced perceived risk and SCRs towards the CS+ and GS1 (the generalization stimulus that is most similar to CS+) during fear generalization, whereas the discrimination threshold was not affected. Conclusions Together, the results suggest that OT can attenuate fear generalization in the absence of effects on discrimination threshold. This study provides the first evidence for effects of OT on fear generalization in humans and suggests that OT may have therapeutic potential in anxiety disorders characterized by dysregulated fear generalization.","[Dou, Haoran; Lei, Yi] Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Brain & Psychol Sci, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China; [Dou, Haoran; Lei, Yi] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China; [Dou, Haoran] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Educ & Psychol, Act Mind Lab, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Zou, Liye] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol, Exercise & Mental Hlth Lab, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China; [Becker, Benjamin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, MOE Key Lab Neuroinformat, Clin Hosp, Chengdu Brain Sci Inst, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China",,"Lei, Y (corresponding author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Brain & Psychol Sci, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China.; Lei, Y (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China.",leiyi821@vip.sina.com,,"Zou, Liye/0000-0001-6411-5710","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31871130, 31571153, 91632117]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0701400]; Science, Innovation and Technology Department of the Sichuan Province [2018JY0001]; Guangdong Key Project in Development of new tools for diagnosis and treatment of Autism [2018B030335001]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31671150]; Innovative Team Program in Higher Education of Guangdong, China [2015KCXTD009]; Major Program of Guangdong, China [2016KZDXM009]; Shenzhen Basic Research Scheme [JCYJ20150729104249783]; Shenzhen Peacock Plan [KQTD2015033016104926];  [2019SHIBS0003]","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant Numbers, 31871130, 31571153, 91632117), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Number 2018YFA0701400), and the Science, Innovation and Technology Department of the Sichuan Province (2018JY0001), Guangdong Key Project in Development of new tools for diagnosis and treatment of Autism (2018B030335001), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31671150), Innovative Team Program in Higher Education of Guangdong, China (2015KCXTD009), Major Program of Guangdong, China (2016KZDXM009), Shenzhen Basic Research Scheme (JCYJ20150729104249783), Shenzhen Peacock Plan (KQTD2015033016104926), Investigation and evaluation of neural mechanisms associated with development of language, emotion, and cognitive disorders, 2019SHIBS0003.",,59,0,0,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,MAR,2021,238,3,,,,,677,689,,10.1007/s00213-020-05720-8,,NOV 2020,13,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,QN9EY,WOS:000592578300001,33241482,,,,2022-04-16,

Emerging strategies to enhance exposure therapy in humans and fear extinction retention in animal models are primarily pharmacological. These approaches are limited as many patients report preferring non-pharmacological approaches in therapy. With general cognitive enhancement effects, exercise has emerged as a plausible non-pharmacological augmentation strategy. The present study tested the hypothesis that fear extinction and exposure therapy would be enhanced by a pre-training bout of exercise. Methods: We conducted four experiments with rats that involved a standardized conditioning and extinction paradigm and a manipulation of exercise. In a fifth experiment, we manipulated vigorous-intensity exercise prior to a standardized virtual reality exposure therapy session among adults with fear of heights. Results: In experiments 1-4, exercise did not facilitate fear extinction, long-term memory, or fear relapse tests. In experiment 5, human participants showed an overall reduction in fear of heights but exercise did not enhance symptom improvement. Conclusions: Although acute exercise prior to fear extinction or exposure therapy, as operationalized in the present 5 studies, did not enhance outcomes, these results must be interpreted within the context of a broader literature that includes positive findings. Taken all together, this suggests that more research is necessary to identify optimal parameters and key individual differences so that exercise can be implemented successfully to treat anxiety disorders.","[Jacquart, Jolene; Roquet, Rheall F.; Papini, Santiago; Powers, Mark B.; Smits, Jasper A.

Here I compare four qualitative methodological approaches to test if, and how, thrill depends on fear. I use eight high-risk, high-skill, real-life outdoor adventure recreation activities to provide the test circumstances. I present data from: >4000 person-days of participant observation; interviews with 40 expert practitioners; retrospective autoethnography of 50 critical incidents over 4 decades; and experimental autoethnography of 60 events. Results from different methods are congruent, but different approaches yield different insights. The principal findings are as follows. Individuals differ in their fear and thrill responses. The same individual may have different responses on different occasions. Fear boosts performance, but panic causes paralysis. Anxiety or apprehension prior to a risky action or event differs from fear experienced during the event itself. The intensity of pre-event fear generally increases with the immediacy of risk to life, and time to contemplate that risk. Fear must be faced, assessed and overcome in order to act. Thrill can occur either during or after a high-risk event. Thrill can occur without fear, and fear without thrill. Below a lower threshold of perceived risk, thrill can occur without fear. Between a lower and upper threshold, thrill increases with fear. Beyond the upper threshold, thrill vanishes but fear remains. This there is a sawtooth relation between fear and thrill. Perceived danger generates intense focus and awareness. Fear and other emotions can disappear during intense concentration and focus. Under high risk, the usual emotional sequence is fear before the action or event, then focus during the action or event, then thrill, relief, or triumph afterward. The emotionless state persists only during the most intense concentration. For events long enough to differentiate time within the events, fear and thrill can arise and fade in different fine-scale sequences.","[Buckley, Ralf C.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Ecotourism Res, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",,"Buckley, RC (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Ecotourism Res, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",ralf.c.buckley@gmail.com,,,,,,170,30,30,3,46,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

However, there is no experimental evidence demonstrating that fear learning and generalization to visceral sensations can be established in humans and alter visceral perception. Methods In a novel fear learning-generalization paradigm, an innocuous esophageal balloon distension served as conditioned stimulus (CS), and distensions at three different pressure levels around the pain detection threshold were used as generalization stimuli. During fear learning, the CS was paired with a painful electrical stimulus (unconditioned stimulus) in the conditioning group (n = 30), whereas in the control group (n = 30), the unconditioned stimulus was delivered alone. Before and after fear learning, visceral perception thresholds for first sensation, discomfort, and pain and visceral discrimination sensitivity were assessed. Results Fear learning was established in the conditioning group only (potentiated eye-blink startle to the CS (t(464.06) = 3.17, p = .002), and fear generalization to other stimulus intensities was observed (t(469.12) = 2.97, p = .003; t(464.29) = 4.17, p < .001). The thresholds for first sensation habituated in the control group, whereas it remained constant in the conditioning group (F(1,43) = 9.77, p = .003). Conclusions These data show that fear learning using visceral stimuli induces fear generalization and influences visceral perception. These findings support the idea that in functional gastrointestinal disorder, fear learning and generalization can foster gastrointestinal-specific anxiety and contribute to visceral hypersensitivity.","[Zaman, Jonas; Weltens, Nathalie; Van den Bergh, Omer; Van Diest, Ilse] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Res Grp Hlth Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Weltens, Nathalie; Ly, Huynh Giao; Van Oudenhove, Lukas] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Res Ctr Gastrointestinal Disorders TARGID, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Leuven, Belgium; [Struyf, Dieter] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Vlaeyen, Johan W.

Conceptually, two distinct models have been invoked to account for extinction. R. A. Rescorla and A. R. Wagner (1972, A theory of Pavlovian conditioning: Variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and nonreinforcement, in A. H. B. W. F. Prokasy (Ed.), Classical conditioning: II. Current research and theory, pp. 64-99, New York, NY, Appleton-Century-Crofts) postulated that the number of exposure trials is the primary determinant of CR decrement, whereas C. R. Gallistel and J. Gibbon (2000, Time, rate, and conditioning, Psychological Review, Vol. 107, pp. 289-344) proposed that the decisive event is the cumulated exposure time to the nonreinforced conditioned stimulus (CS) elapsed after the last CS reinforcement. We evaluated these two accounts in a human differential fear conditioning study in which CR was measured with the fear-potentiated startle response. Cumulated duration of nonreinforcement falls to explain our findings, whereas the number of trials appeared critical. In fact, many CS trials with a duration shorter than the acquisition CS duration facilitated within-session extinction, but this effect did not predict the recovery of fear.","[Golkar, Armita; Bellander, Martin; Ohman, Arne] Karolinska Inst, Psychol Sect, Dept Clin Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Golkar, A (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Psychol Sect, Dept Clin Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",armita.golkar@ki.se,"Bellander, Martin/C-9819-2013","Golkar, Armita/0000-0003-3077-0391",,,,37,26,26,0,24,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

While both benzodiazepines and stimulant drugs may influence the formation of episodic memories for emotional events, their effects on fear conditioning are less clear. This study compared the effects of diazepam with methylphenidate on fear conditioning. In a single-session between groups design with three conditions [placebo, diazepam (10 mg), and methylphenidate (40 mg)], classical conditioning of a skin conductance response to a visual stimulus previously paired with a 100-db white noise was tested in 45 healthy volunteers. Diazepam blocked fear conditioning, despite responses to the unconditioned aversive stimulus and neutral control stimulus being unimpaired. Conditioning remained intact after methylphenidate. Conditioned responses were not extinguished completely by the end of the experiment, and it was not possible to draw conclusions about the effects of the drugs on extinction. Although diazepam has well-documented amnesic effects, it has not been found to affect implicit forms of memory like perceptual and conceptual priming. As the present study found impaired fear conditioning after diazepam, it adds weight to recent findings that emotional memories are disproportionately impaired by the benzodiazepines.","Univ Southampton, Sch Psychol, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; UCL, Subdept Clin Hlth Psychol, Clin Psychopharmacol Unit, London WC1H 6BT, England",,"Brignell, CM (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Psychol, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",c.brignell@soton.ac.uk,,"Brignell, Catherine //0000-0001-7768-6272",,,,69,14,14,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JUL,2006,186,4,,,,,504,516,,10.1007/s00213-006-0363-x,,,13,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,051DD,WOS:000238140000002,16758238,,,,2022-04-16,

Indirect evidence in rodents suggests that acute cortisone could selectively increase some forms of long-duration aversive states, such as anxiety, but not relatively similar, briefer aversive states, such as fear. However, no prior experimental studies in humans consider the unique effects of cortisol on anxiety and fear, using well-validated methods for eliciting these two similar but dissociable aversive states. The current study examines these effects, as instantiated with short- and long-duration threats. Methods: Healthy volunteers (n = 18) received placebo or a low (20 mg) or a high (60 mg) dose of hydrocortisone in a double-blind crossover design. Subjects were exposed repeatedly to three 150-sec duration conditions: no shock; predictable shocks, in which shocks were signaled by a short-duration threat cue; and unpredictable shocks. Aversive states were indexed by acoustic startle. Fear was operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during the threat cue in the predictable condition (fear-potentiated startle). Anxiety was operationally defined as the increase in baseline startle from the no shock to the two threat conditions (anxiety-potentiated startle). Results: Hydrocortisone affected neither baseline nor short-duration, fear-potentiated startle but increased long-duration anxiety-potentiated startle. Conclusions: These results suggest that hydrocortisone administration in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear. Possible mechanisms implicated are discussed in light of prior data in rodents. Specifically, hydrocortisone might increase anxiety via sensitization of corticotrophin-releasing hormones in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.","[Grillon, Christian; Heller, Randi; Hirschhorn, Elizabeth; Pine, Daniel S.] NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kling, Mitchel A.] Philadelphia Vet Adm Med Ctr, Behav Hlth Serv, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Schulkin, Jay] Georgetown Univ Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Washington, DC USA; [Vythilingam, Meena] Off Assistant Secretary Def, Falls Church, VA USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH MAP, 15K North Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 203,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,"Kling, Mitchel A/F-4152-2010; Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019","Kling, Mitchel A/0000-0002-2232-1409; ",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health.,,52,23,23,1,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Conditioned fear in animals has been considered a good model for human anxiety disorders, but animal models of anxiety have several limitations. Conditioned fear in animals can be directed to a specific stressor and is easily extinguished. Furthermore, animals do not seem to be able to develop the capacity to worry excessively about the future. While animal models are useful and can demonstrate psychiatric illnesses, they do not completely mimic the complex cognitive processes that occur in anxious humans. Thus, we hypothesize that human anxiety disorders are caused at least in part by differential activity in the prefrontal cortex, the brain region that most separates us from our nearest genetic neighbors. The human prefrontal cortex has not only been shown to be more developed than that of other mammals, but it also has unique morphology and gene expression. Neuroimaging studies repeatedly show abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex in anxious individuals. Thus, we suggest that the very same cortical complexity that allows us to produce a vibrant culture is also the seat of anxiety disorders. Interestingly, preclinical studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex inhibits the amygdala. There appears to be a distinction between two classes of anxiety disorders. Those disorders involving intense fear and panic - panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias - seem to be characterized by an underactivity of the prefrontal cortex, thus disinhibiting the amygdala. Disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which involve worry and rumination, on the other hand, seem to be characterized by an overactivity of the prefrontal cortex. Studies of prefrontal cortical function in psychiatric illness should be a fruitful method for identifying effective treatment approaches.","Comprehens Neurosci Inc, White Plains, NY 10605 USA; Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; Kings County Hosp Ctr, White Plains, NY USA",,"Gorman, JM (corresponding author), Comprehens Neurosci Inc, 21 Bloomingdale Rd, White Plains, NY 10605 USA.",jack.gorman@alumni.upenn.edu,,,,,,87,72,77,2,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0334-1763,1607-8470,,REV NEUROSCIENCE,Rev.

While animal models have revealed developmental changes in amygdala circuitry accompanying emerging fear, human neural systems involved in early fear development remain poorly understood. To increase understanding of the neural foundations of human fear, it is important to consider parallel cognitive development, which may modulate associations between typical development of early fear and subsequent risk for fear related psychopathology. We, therefore, examined amygdala functional connectivity with rs-fcMRI in 48 neonates (M=3.65 weeks, SD = 1.72), and measured fear and cognitive development at 6-months-of-age. Stronger, positive neonatal amygdala connectivity to several regions, including bilateral anterior insula and ventral striatum, was prospectively associated with higher fear at 6-months. Stronger amygdala connectivity to ventral anterior cingulate/anterior medial prefrontal cortex predicted a specific phenotype of higher fear combined with more advanced cognitive development. Overall, findings demonstrate unique profiles of neonatal amygdala functional connectivity related to emerging fear and cognitive development, which may have implications for normative and pathological fear in later years.

This increase may be linked to both new exposures, such as violence at home or in the community, or to physiological changes driven by puberty. There are significant sex differences in adolescent risk, for instance, anxiety disorders are significantly more prevalent in girls than boys. Fear learning is linked to mental health and may develop during adolescence, but the role of puberty in adolescent-specific change has not yet been systematically evaluated. We conducted a longitudinal study of fear learning that tested fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in 78 children (40 girls) aged 8-16 years. Participants completed two to three visits that included a differential fear conditioning task and self-report of both pubertal status and violence exposure. We tested for effects of sex, pubertal status, and violence exposure on FPS over time with latent growth curve models. We also examined the association between FPS and later anxiety symptoms. We found significant changes in FPS to the threat cue, but not the safety cue, across visits. Higher pubertal status was significantly associated with increased FPS to threat cues at each visit, whereas sex and violence exposure were not. FPS to threat during the baseline visit also predicted later anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that puberty drives increased fear response to threat cues similarly for girls and boys, and that this effect may not be significantly impacted by individual differences in violence exposure during early adolescence.","[Stenson, Anais F.; Minton, Sean T.; Jovanovic, Tanja] Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, 3901 Chrysler Serv Dr, Detroit, MI 48201 USA; [Stenson, Anais F.; van Rooij, Sanne J.

We used positron emission tomography with O-15-water to study neural networks associated with startle modulation by phobic fear in a group of subjects with specific snake or spider phobia, but not both, during exposure to pictures of their feared and non-feared objects, paired and unpaired with acoustic startle stimuli. Measurement of eye electromyographic activity confirmed startle potentiation during the phobic as compared with the non-phobic condition. Employing a factorial design, we evaluated brain correlates of startle modulation as the interaction between startle and affect, using the double subtraction contrast (phobic startle vs. phobic alone) vs. (non-phobic startle vs. non-phobic alone). As a result of startle potentiation, a significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow was found in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region, and medially in the affective division of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These results provide evidence from functional brain imaging for a modulatory role of the amygdaloid complex on startle reactions in humans. They also point to the involvement of the affective ACC in the processing of startle stimuli during emotionally aversive experiences. The co-activation of these areas may reflect increased attention to fear-relevant stimuli. Thus, we suggest that the amygdaloid area and the ACC form part of a neural system dedicated to attention and orientation to danger, and that this network modulates startle during negative affect.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychiat, Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Imanet, Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Tromso, Dept Psychol, N-9001 Tromso, Norway",,"Pissiota, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Uppsala, Sweden.",anna.pissiota@psyk.uu.se,"Flaten, Magne Arve/A-2029-2014",,,,,62,110,114,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0953-816X,1460-9568,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

This nuanced story has been obscured by a great deal of research into the therapeutic applications of exogenous OT, driving more than 400 ongoing clinical trials. Drawing from animal models and human studies, we review the complex evidence concerning OT's role in fear learning and anxiety, clarifying the existing confusion about modulation of fear versus anxiety. We discuss animal models and human studies demonstrating the prevailing role of OT in strengthening fear memory to a discrete signal or cue, which allows accurate and rapid threat detection that facilitates survival. We also review ostensibly contrasting behavioral studies that nonetheless provide compelling evidence of OT attenuating sustained contextual fear and anxiety-like behavior, arguing that these OT effects on the modulation of fear vs. anxiety are not mutually exclusive. To disambiguate how endogenous OT modulates fear and anxiety, an understudied area compared to exogenous OT, we survey behavioral studies utilizing OT receptor (OTR) antagonists. Based on emerging evidence about the role of OTR in rat dorsolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and elsewhere, we postulate that OT plays a critical role in facilitating accurate discrimination between stimuli representing threat and safety. Supported by human studies, we demonstrate that OT uniquely facilitates adaptive fear but reduces maladaptive anxiety. Last, we explore the limited literature on endogenous OT and its interaction with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) with a special emphasis on the dorsolateral BNST, which may hold the key to the neurobiology of phasic fear and sustained anxiety.","[Janecek, Michael; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Neurosci, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA",,"Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.; Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Neurosci, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",joanna.dabrowska@rosalindfranklin.edu,,"Janecek, Michael/0000-0001-5348-2785","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH113007]; DePaul-RFUMS seed research grant; Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH113007] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Rachyl Shanker, CMS'20 from the Dabrowska Lab for the image of PKC-STEP double-immunolabeling in the BNST<INF>dl</INF>.

Rather, the acoustic parameters affected by emotion vary depending on the emotion type. In this context, the emotion-based variability of acoustic parameters is still a current field of study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the acoustic parameters that fear affects and the extent of their influence. For this purpose, various acoustic parameters were obtained from speech records containing fear and neutral emotions. The change according to the emotional states of these parameters was analyzed using statistical methods, and the parameters and the degree of influence that the fear emotion affected were determined. According to the results obtained, the majority of acoustic parameters that fear affects vary according to the used data.

The current study examined children's perception of fear in various traffic situations and the relationship between fear perception and pedestrian decisions. Method: 150 children aged 6-12-years old made pedestrian decisions using a table-top road model. Their perceived fear in the pedestrian context was assessed. Results: Children reported greater emotional fear when they faced quicker traffic, shorter distances from approaching traffic, and red rather than green traffic signals. Children who were more fearful made safer pedestrian decisions in more challenging traffic situations. However, when the least risky traffic situation was presented, fear was associated with more errors in children's pedestrian decisions: fearful children failed to cross the street when they could have done so safely. Perception of fear did not vary by child age, although safe pedestrian decisions were more common among the older children. Conclusions: Children's emotional fear may predict risk-taking in traffic. When traffic situations are challenging to cross within, fear may appropriately create safer decisions. However, when the traffic situation is less risky, feelings of fear could lead to excessive caution and inefficiency. Practical applications: Child pedestrian safety interventions may benefit by incorporating activities that introduce realistic fear of traffic risks into broader safety lessons.

Previous studies indicated that the acid sensing ion channel ASIC1 a influences fear behavior in conditioning paradigms. However,these differences may have resulted from an ASIC1 a effect on learning, memory, or the expression of fear. Methods: To test the hypothesis that ASIC1a influences the expression of fear or anxiety independent of classical conditioning, we examined the effects of disrupting the mouse ASIC1a gene on unconditioned fear in the open field test, unconditioned acoustic startle, and fear evoked by the predator odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT). In addition, we tested the effects of acutely inhibiting ASIC1 a with PcTx, an ASIC1a antagonist in tarantula venom. Our immunohistochemistry suggested ASIC1a is expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdala, and periaqueductal gray, which are thought to play important roles in the generation and expression of innate fear. Therefore, we also tested whether ASIC1 a disruption altered c-fos expression in these structures following TMT exposure. Results: We found that the loss of ASIC1 a reduced fear in the open field test, reduced acoustic startle, and inhibited the fear response to TMT. Similarly, intracerebroventricular administration of PcTx reduced TMT-evoked freezing in ASIC1a(+/+) mice but not ASIC1a(-/-) mice. In addition, loss of ASIC1 a altered TMT-evoked c-fos expression in the medial amydala and dorsal periaqueductal gray. Conclusions: These findings suggest that ASIC1 a modulates activity in the circuits underlying innate fear. Furthermore, the data indicate that targeting the ASIC1a gene or acutely inhibiting ASIC1 a suppresses fear and anxiety independent of conditioning.","Univ Iowa, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Neurosci Program, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",,"Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, 500 Eckstein Med Res Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",john-wemmie@uiowa.edu,,"Wemmie, John/0000-0001-7531-9065; Zha, Xiangming/0000-0001-9490-2731",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM007337] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,68,100,103,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Given the high comorbidity between OCD and anxiety, OCD symptom clusters may more broadly associate with fear and/or distress internalizing constructs. This study examines fear and distress dimensions, including physical concerns (fear), separation anxiety (fear), perfectionism (distress), and anxious coping (distress), as predictors of previously empirically-derived OCD symptom clusters in a sample of 215 youth diagnosed with primary OCD (ages 7-17, mean age = 12.25). Self-reported separation fears predicted membership in Cluster 1 (aggressive, sexual, religious, somatic obsessions, and checking compulsions) while somatic/autonomic fears predicted membership in Cluster 2 (symmetry obsessions and ordering, counting, repeating compulsions). Results highlight the diversity of pediatric OCD symptoms and their differential association with fear, suggesting the need to carefully assess both OCD and global fear constructs that might be directly targeted in treatment.","[Rozenman, Michelle; Peris, Tara; Bergman, R.

Recent work has demonstrated generalization (i.e., transfer) of conditioned fear across perceptual dimensions and conceptual categories, but it is not clear how fear generalization influences other cognitive processes. The current study investigated how associative fear learning impacts higher-order visuospatial attention, specifically in terms of attentional bias toward generalized threats (i.e., the heightened assessment of potentially dangerous stimuli). We combined discriminative fear conditioning of color stimuli with a subsequent visual search task, in which targets and distractors were presented inside colored circles that varied in perceptual similarity to the fear-conditioned color. Skin conductance responses validated the fear-conditioning manipulation. Search response times indicated that attention was preferentially deployed not just to the specific fear-conditioned color, but also to similar colors that were never paired with the aversive shock. Furthermore, this attentional bias decreased continuously and symmetrically from the fear-conditioned value along the color spectrum, indicating a generalization gradient based on perceptual similarity. These results support functional accounts of fear learning that promote broad, defensive generalization of attentional bias toward threat.","[Dowd, Emma Wu; Mitroff, Stephen R.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Room B203,LSRC Bldg,Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Mitroff, Stephen R.] George Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"LaBar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Room B203,LSRC Bldg,Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",klabar@duke.edu,,"Dowd, Emma Wu/0000-0003-0219-8527",,,,42,5,6,0,37,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,1931-1516,,EMOTION,Emotion,OCT,2016,16,7,,,,,1011,1018,,10.1037/emo0000197,,,8,"Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology,DY9FE,WOS:000385438300009,27213724,,,,2022-04-16,

Most studies examine these changes in nondiscriminative fear conditioning paradigms. Using a discriminative fear, safety, and reward conditioning task, Sangha et al. (2013) have previously reported several neural microcircuits within the basal amygdala (BA) which discriminate among these cues, including a subpopulation of neurons responding selectively to a safety cue and not a fear cue. Here, the hypothesis that these safety neurons isolated during discriminative conditioning are biased to become fear cue responsive as a result of extinction, when fear behavior diminishes, was tested. Although 41% of safety neurons became fear cue responsive as a result of extinction, the data revealed that there was no bias for these neurons to become preferentially responsive during fear extinction compared to the other identified subgroups. In addition to the plasticity seen in the safety neurons, 44% of neurons unresponsive to either the fear cue or safety cue during discriminative conditioning became fear cue responsive during extinction. Together these emergent responses to the fear cue as a result of extinction support the hypothesis that new learning underlies extinction. In contrast, 47% of neurons responsive to the fear cue during discriminative conditioning became unresponsive to the fear cue during extinction. These findings are consistent with a suppression of neural responding mediated by inhibitory learning, or, potentially, by direct unlearning. Together, the data support extinction as an active process involving both gains and losses of responses to the fear cue and suggests the final output of the integrated BA circuit in influencing fear behavior is a balance of excitation and inhibition, and perhaps reversal of learning induced changes.","[Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sangha, Susan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ernest Gallo Clin, Emeryville, CA USA; [Sangha, Susan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Res Ctr, Emeryville, CA USA",,"Sangha, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sangha@purdue.edu,,"Sangha, Susan/0000-0002-6461-4146",State of California for Medical Research on Alcohol and Substance Abuse through the University of California at San Francisco; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AA014925]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA014925] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by funding from the State of California for Medical Research on Alcohol and Substance Abuse through the University of California at San Francisco and NIH grant AA014925 to Dr. P.

Whether individuals have a higher risk of community falls and a fear of falling has not been examined amongst individuals after critical illness. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of falls, fear of falling, and fall risk in intensive care unit (ICU) survivors over a 6-month period after hospital discharge. Methods: This was a nested exploratory study within a medical ICU. Fall prevalence was measured in line with established guidelines over 6 months after ICU discharge. Fear of falling and prediction of fall risk were assessed at 2, 4, and 6 months after discharge. Results: Twelve individuals were included. Half of the cohort (n = 6) had at least one fall, with one-third sustaining more than one fall. There were 17 falls reported across the six individuals. Injuries requiring medical intervention were reported with five falls. Almost one-third were classified as 'moderate' to 'severe' injurious falls. Loss of balance and fatigue were reported as the main contributors to the falls. All individuals who had a fall reported a severe fear of falling at 2 months. Individuals classified as having 'moderate' to 'high' risk of falls at 2 months were more likely to have at least one fall. Conclusions: This study suggests that ICU survivors may have a high fall risk, fear of falling, and fall prevalence, which can result in significant injury.

However, human data on the relation between testosterone, fear, and anxiety have predominantly involved questionnaires that index cortically executed conscious appraisal of anxious mood. Animal studies, on the other band, indicate that the effects of testosterone on motivation and emotion are of subcortical origin and of unconscious nature. Presently, it was hypothesized that a single testosterone administration to humans would reduce unconscious fear but not consciously experienced anxiety. Methods: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design, a single dose of testosterone (.5 mg) or placebo was administered to 16 healthy female volunteers. Afterward, a masked emotional Stroop task measured unconscious emotional responses to fearful faces, while multiple self-reports of mood indexed consciously experienced anxiety. Results: As hypothesized, the habitual vigilant emotional response to the masked fearful face observed in the placebo condition was significantly reduced after testosterone was administered, while the self-reported measures of anxiety remained unaffected. Conclusions: These data provide the first direct evidence for fear-reducing properties of testosterone in humans. Furthermore, by dissociating specific aspects of fear and anxiety in humans, this outcome highlights that testosterone's effects on motivation and emotion concern the subcortical affective pathways of the brain.","Univ Utrecht, Helmholtz Res Inst, Affect Neurosci Sect, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Med Ctr, Rudolf Magnus Inst Neurosci, Dept Psychiat, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"van Honk, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Helmholtz Res Inst, Affect Neurosci Sect, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",J.vanhonk@fss.uu.nl,,,,,,90,187,189,2,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

In the laboratory, relapse is modeled as return of conditioned fear responses after successful fear extinction and is explained by insufficient retrieval and/or expression of the fear-inhibitory extinction memory that is generated during extinction learning. We have shown in mice and humans that return of fear can be prevented by administration of a single dose of the dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) immediately after extinction. In mice, this effect could be attributed to an enhancement of extinction memory consolidation. In our human study, we could not exclude that L-DOPA might have acted by interfering with the consolidation of the original fear memory. In the present study, we therefore used a combined differential cue and context conditioning paradigm where initial fear conditioning and extinction were conducted one day apart, in analogy to previous mouse studies. L-DOPA (N=21) or placebo (N=19) were administered after extinction, precluding any action on fear memory consolidation. In the return-of-fear test conducted one week later, drug effects on conditioned skin conductance responses were absent. However, we found evidence indicative of reduced neural activity, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the L-DOPA group in areas related to conditioned fear and return of fear (amygdala, posterior hippocampus) and enhanced activity in a key area of extinction retrieval/expression (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), relative to placebo controls. These findings require further corroboration in additional experiments. Implications for further investigations on the role of the dopamine system in extinction and on the neuropharmacological augmentation of extinction-based therapies are discussed.

Previous animal based studies showed that the activity of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) are involved in memory modulation. However in humans it is not clear that whether genetic variability in beta-ARs contributes to individual differences of fear and extinction memory. In the current study, we investigated the role of a common single-nucleotide polymorphism of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene in fear memory acquisition, fear memory extinction, extinction recall and fear generalization in human participants. Ninety-one male participants were exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning and their fear responses were assessed by the skin conductance response. Participants were genotyped for a polymorphism (r52400207) located within the promoter region of the human ADRB2. Differences between genotypes were observed in the extinction memory recall test but not in fear acquisition, extinction learning and fear generalization. Particularly, A-allele carriers of rs2400707 displayed successful retention of extinction memory and prevented the return of fear during recall test. The results revealed the involvement of human noradrenergic system in the retention of extinction memory and genetic variability in this system may underlie individual differences in PTSD. Furthermore, r52400207 polymorphism of ADRB2 gene may play a key role in the treatment efficacy of PTSD and can be a basis for future studies investigating a personalized medicine for fear memory related disorders.","[Shi, Le; Chen, Si-Jing; Deng, Jia-Hui; Que, Jian-Yu; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Univ Hosp 6, Peking Univ Inst Mental Hlth,Minist Hlth, Key Lab Mental Hlth,Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Diso, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Si-Jing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao] Peking Univ, Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yan; Bao, Yan-Ping; Shi, Jie] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Shi, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Peking Univ Hosp 6, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Inst Mental Hlth, 51 Huayuan Bei Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",shijie@bjmu.edu.cn; linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,,"Bao, Yanping/0000-0002-1881-0939",National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB856400]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology CommissionBeijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z151100003915121]; National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2015BAI13B01]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81521063],"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (no. 2015CB856400), Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (no.

Once a stimulus is learned to predict harm, it can elicit fear responses. Such learning can last a lifetime but is not always beneficial for an organism. For an organism to thrive in its environment, it must know when to engage in defensive, avoidance behaviors and when to engage in non-defensive, approach behaviors. Fear should be suppressed in situations that are not dangerous: when a novel, innocuous stimulus resembles a feared stimulus, when a feared stimulus no longer predicts harm, or when there is an option to avoid harm. A cardinal feature of anxiety disorders is the inability to suppress fear adaptively. In PTSD, for instance, learned fear is expressed inappropriately in safe situations and is resistant to extinction. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of suppressing fear responses during stimulus discrimination, fear extinction, and active avoidance, focusing on the well-studied tripartite circuit consisting of the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.","[Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Purdue Inst Integrat Neurosci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Diehl, Maria M.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Bergstrom, Hadley C.] Vassar Coll, Dept Psychol Sci, Program Neurosci & Behav, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA; [Drew, Michael R.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Drew, Michael R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Sangha, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Sangha, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Purdue Inst Integrat Neurosci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Diehl, MM (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.; Bergstrom, HC (corresponding author), Vassar Coll, Dept Psychol Sci, Program Neurosci & Behav, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA.; Drew, MR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA.; Drew, MR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",sangha@purdue.edu; maria.m.diehl@gmail.com; habergstrom@vassar.edu; mdrew@utexas.edu,"Diehl, Maria/L-6410-2019","Diehl, Maria/0000-0002-7370-6106; Sangha, Susan/0000-0002-6461-4146","NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01-MH102595, R01 MH117426];  [NIMHR01-MH110425];  [NIAAAP50AA017823]",S.S. is supported by NIMHR01-MH110425; H.C.B. is supported by NIAAAP50AA017823; M.R.D. is supported by NIMH R01-MH102595 and R01 MH117426.,,192,28,28,3,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0149-7634,1873-7528,,NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R,Neurosci.

We examined whether a CS- presented during acquisition or extinction that predicted the absence of the unconditional stimulus (US) could act as a temporal context cue, reducing or enhancing responding, in differential fear conditioning. Two groups received acquisition (CSx-US, CSa-noUS) in phase 1 and extinction (CSx-noUS; CSe-noUS) in phase 2 (AE groups), and two groups received extinction in phase 1 and acquisition in phase 2 (EA groups). After a delay, participants were presented with either CSa (AEa and EAa groups) or CSe (AEe and EAe groups). Responding to CSx was enhanced after presentation of CSa but reduced after presentation of CSe, suggesting that training was segmented into two learning episodes and that the unreinforced CS present during an episode retrieved the CSx-US or CSx-noUS association.

Here we demonstrate that repeated microinjections of CBD into the infralimbic cortex (IL) facilitated fear extinction, as indicated by reduced levels of freezing during extinction test. Systemic administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant blocked the effects of intra-IL CBD, suggesting that CBD acts through CBI receptors to facilitate fear extinction.

Extinction is believed to be mediated by new inhibitory learning that acts to suppress fear expression without erasing the original memory trace. This hypothesis is supported mainly by behavioral data demonstrating that fear can recover following extinction. However, a recent report by Myers and coworkers suggests that extinction conducted immediately after fear learning may erase or prevent the consolidation of the fear memory trace. Since extinction is a major component of nearly all behavioral therapies for human fear disorders, this finding supports the notion that therapeutic intervention beginning very soon after a traumatic event will be more efficacious. Given the importance of this issue, and the controversy regarding immediate versus delayed therapeutic interventions, we examined two fear recovery phenomena in both rats and humans: spontaneous recovery (SR) and reinstatement. We found evidence for SR and reinstatement in both rats and humans even when extinction was conducted immediately after fear learning. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that immediate extinction erases the original memory trace, nor do they suggest that a close temporal proximity of therapeutic intervention to the traumatic event might be advantageous.","[Schiller, Daniela; Curley, Nina G.; Schwartz, Jennifer S.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Schiller, Daniela; Cain, Christopher K.; Stern, Sarah A.; LeDoux, Joseph E.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Phelps, EA (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",liz.phelps@nyu.edu,"Stern, Sarah/AAV-6019-2021; Schiller, Daniela/Q-2431-2018","Stern, Sarah/0000-0002-3033-8251; Schiller, Daniela/0000-0002-0357-7724; Cain, Christopher/0000-0002-3929-6094","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH038774, F32MH077458, K05MH067048, R21MH072279, P50MH058911, R01MH046516] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50 MH58911, R37MH38774, R01 MH46516, R01 MH046516-17, R37 MH038774, R01 MH046516, K05 MH067048-05, F32 MH077458, P50 MH058911-09, K05 MH067048, R37 MH038774-23, P50 MH058911, R21 MH072279, F32MH077458] Funding Source: Medline",,,54,116,117,0,22,"COLD SPRING HARBOR LAB PRESS, PUBLICATIONS DEPT",COLD SPRING HARBOR,"1 BUNGTOWN RD, COLD SPRING HARBOR, NY 11724 USA",1072-0502,1549-5485,,LEARN MEMORY,Learn.

In the laboratory, maladaptive fear can be modeled in rodents using Pavlovian fear conditioning. Recently, an inbred mouse strain known as 129S1/SvImJ, or 129S1 has been reported as exhibiting impairments in fear extinction and enhanced fear generalization. With a long-term goal of identifying segregating genetic markers of maladaptive fear, we used Pavlovian fear conditioning to characterize a closely related substrain designated as 129S6/SvEvTac, or 129S6. Here we report that, like 129S1 animals, 129S6 mice exhibit appropriate levels of fear upon conditioning, but are unable to extinguish fear memories once they are consolidated. Importantly, the maladaptive fear phenotype in this inbred stain can be segregated by sub-strain when probed using conditioning protocols designed to assess generalized fear. We find that unlike the 129S1 substrain, mice from the 129S6 sub-strain do not generalize conditioned fear to previously novel contexts and can learn to discriminate between two similar contexts when trained using a discrimination protocol. These results suggest that at least two forms of maladaptive fear (deficits in fear extinction and fear generalization) can be can be functionally segregated, further suggesting that the underlying neurobiology is heritable. Given the observation that two closely related sub-strains can exhibit different constellations of maladaptive fear suggests that these findings could be exploited to facilitate the identification of candidate genes for anxiety-related disorders.","[Temme, Stephanie J.; Murphy, Geoffrey G.] Univ Michigan, Grad Program Neurosci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bell, Ryan Z.; Pahumi, Reciton; Murphy, Geoffrey G.] Univ Michigan, Mol & Behav Neurosci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Murphy, Geoffrey G.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Murphy, GG (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Mol & Integrat Physiol, 5037 Biomed Sci Res Bldg,109 Zina Pitcher Pl, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",murphyg@umich.edu,,,"National Science Foundation, Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF); Society of Neuroscience, Neuroscience Scholars Program; NIAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R01 AG028488]","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation, Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the Society of Neuroscience, Neuroscience Scholars Program, and NIA R01 AG028488.",,44,9,9,0,7,FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

We now test the hypothesis that habituation and acquisition stages of a fear conditioning protocol are characterized by different event-related causal interactions (ERCs) within and between these modules. The protocol used the painful cutaneous laser as the unconditioned stimulus and ERC was estimated by analysis of local field potentials recorded through electrodes implanted for investigation of epilepsy. During the prestimulus interval of the habituation stage FL>AMY ERC interactions were common. For comparison, in the poststimulus interval of the habituation stage, only a subdivision of the FL (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dIPFC) still exerted the FL>AMY ERC interaction (dIFC>AMY). For a further comparison, during the poststimulus interval of the acquisition stage, the dIPFC>AMY interaction persisted and an AMY>FL interaction appeared. In addition to these ERC interactions between modules, the results also show ERC interactions within modules. During the poststimulus interval, HIP>HIP ERC interactions were more common during acquisition, and deep hippocampal contacts exerted causal interactions on superficial contacts, possibly explained by connectivity between the perihippocampal gyrus and the HIP. During the prestimulus interval of the habituation stage, AMY>AMY ERC interactions were commonly found, while interactions between the deep and superficial AMY (indirect pathway) were independent of intervals and stages. These results suggest that the network subserving fear includes distributed or widespread modules, some of which are themselves local networks. ERC interactions between and within modules can be either static or change dynamically across intervals or stages of fear conditioning. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Presently, there is substantial evidence supporting the Synaptic Plasticity-Memory (SPM) hypothesis in relation to the mechanisms underlying the acquisition, retention, and extinction of conditioned fear memory. Objectives The purpose of this review article is to summarize findings supporting the SPM hypothesis in the context of conditioned fear control, applying the set of criteria and tests which were proposed as necessary to causally link lasting changes in synaptic transmission in corresponding neural circuits to fear memory acquisition and extinction with an emphasis on their pharmacological diversity. Results The mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in fear circuits exhibit complex pharmacological profiles and satisfy all four SPM criteria-detectability, anterograde alteration, retrograde alteration, and mimicry. Conclusion The reviewed findings, accumulated over the last two decades, provide support for both necessity and sufficiency of synaptic plasticity in fear circuits for fear memory acquisition and retention, and, in part, for fear extinction, with the latter requiring additional experimental work.","[Luchkina, Natalia V.; Bolshakov, Vadim Y.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, McLean Hosp, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02478 USA",,"Luchkina, NV; Bolshakov, VY (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, McLean Hosp, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02478 USA.",nluchkina@mclean.harvard.edu; vadimb@mclean.harvard.edu,"Luchkina, Natalia V/K-9007-2016","Luchkina, Natalia V/0000-0002-8113-9594","NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH108665, R01MH105851]; Phyllis & Jerome Lyle Rappaport Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH105851, R01MH108665] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",We thank Vernon Clarke and members of the laboratory for help and constructive discussions.

The study evaluated the potential for adverse human health effects associated with selenium, and considered known and potential benefits of selenium and fish ingestion. The results indicated that risks of selenosis due to consumption of selenium-contaminated fish in the region are negligible. Conclusions were strengthened by consideration of the potential benefits of selenium to human health, including: selenium essentiality for maintenance of good health; potential cancer prevention properties due to its role as an antioxidant; potential benefits for cardiovascular health; and other positive health benefits. The findings indicated that some aspects of the traditional framework for HHRA (e.g., application of safety factors to err on the side of safety) are inappropriate for the assessment of selenium-contaminated fish. Due to both deficiency and toxicity in the selenium dose-response relationship, application of compounding conservatism in risk assessment may lead to recommended intakes of fish that are contrary to the public health interest. The need for balancing risk types, for incorporating positive responses in risk assessments, and the linkage to the precautionary principle, are discussed.","Golder Associates, N Vancouver, BC V7P 2R4, Canada",,"Lawrence, GS (corresponding author), Golder Associates, 195 Pemberton Ave, N Vancouver, BC V7P 2R4, Canada.",glawrence@golder.com,,,,,,80,8,9,1,32,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Eighty-nine broiler flocks were inspected in 4 European countries (France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) in a cross-sectional study. The ABM were contact dermatitis (measured using scores of foot-pad dermatitis and hock burn, respectively), lameness (measured as gait score), fear of humans (measured by the avoidance distance test and the touch test), and negative emotional state (measured using qualitative behavior assessment, QBA). In a first step, risk factors were identified by building a multiple linear regression model for each ABM. Litter quality was identified as a risk factor for contact dermatitis. Length of dark period at 3 wk old (DARK3) was a risk factor for the touch test result. DARK3 and flock age were risk factors for lameness, and the number of different stockmen and DARK3 were risk factors for QBA results. Next, the ABM were grouped according to risk factor and counted. Then, in a second step, associations between the ABM were investigated using common factor analysis. The breadth of a risk factor's effect was judged by combining the number (count) of ABM related to this factor and the strength of association between these ABM. Flock age and DARK3 appeared to affect several weakly correlated ABM, thus indicating a broad range of effects. Our findings suggest that manipulation of the predominant risk factors identified in this study (DARK3, litter quality, and slaughter age) could generate improvements in the related ABM and thereby enhance the birds' overall welfare status.","[Bassler, A.

However, little is known about renewal of avoidance. This multimodal laboratory-based treatment study used an ABA renewal design and an approach-avoidance (AP-AV) task to examine renewal of fear/threat and avoidance in twenty adults. In Context A, 9 visual cues paired with increases in probabilistic money loss (escalating threats) produced increases in ratings of feeling threatened and loss expectancies and skin-conductance responses (SCR). During the AP-AV task, a monetary reinforcer was available concurrently with threats. Approach produced the reinforcer or probabilistic loss, while avoidance prevented loss and forfeited reinforcement. Escalating threat produced increasing avoidance and ratings. In Context B with Pavlovian extinction, threats signaled no money loss and SCR declined. During the AP-AV task, avoidance and ratings also declined. In a return to Context A with Pavlovian threat extinction in effect during the AP-AV task, renewal was observed. Escalating threat was associated with increasing ratings and avoidance in most participants. SCR did not show renewal. These are the first translational findings to highlight renewal of avoidance in humans. Further research should identify individual difference variables and altered neural mechanisms that may confer increased risk of avoidance renewal.","[Schlund, Michael W.; Tone, Erin B.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Schlund, Michael W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Ludlum, Madonna; Magee, Sandy K.] Univ North Texas, Dept Behav Anal, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Brewer, Adam] Western Connecticut State Univ, Dept Educ, Danbury, CT USA; [Richman, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Educ Psychol & Leadership, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Dymond, Simon] Swansea Univ, Dept Psychol, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Dymond, Simon] Reykjavik Univ, Dept Psychol, Reykjavik, Iceland",,"Schlund, MW (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.; Schlund, MW (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",mschlund@gsu.edu,,,National Institutes of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH120448-01],Data analyses and manuscript preparation was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health (R01MH120448-01) to MS and ET.,,59,6,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-5002,1938-3711,,J EXP ANAL BEHAV,J.

Conditioned fears spread beyond what is reasonable or adaptive, leading to broad and interfering anxieties when people overgeneralize their fears. Difficulties with mnemonic discrimination, a component process of memory supporting the integration of old and new experiences, may foster overgeneralization and increase risk for anxiety disorders. Individuals along a spectrum of anxiety severity (n = 117) completed a differential fear conditioning paradigm and the computerized Mnemonic Similarity Task. The task measures mnemonic discrimination by requiring individuals to differentiate between highly similar old and new entities. We predicted that low mnemonic discrimination would be associated with overgeneralization, i.e., flatter slopes of change in response to stimuli increasingly dissimilar to the conditioned stimulus. Conditional growth models showed that as expected, participants with the highest mnemonic discrimination scores also exhibited the steepest declines in fear ratings as stimuli increasingly differed from the conditioned stimulus. Results were unchanged after adjusting for recognition memory, self-reported anxiety, and clinical diagnoses and symptoms. Results support the hypothesis that memory interference (i.e., low mnemonic discrimination) could increase vulnerability for overgeneralization. Findings justify additional exploration of mnemonic discrimination and its role in anxious psychopathology.","[Bernstein, Emily E.; McNally, Richard J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [van der Does, Floor] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Orr, Scott P.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Orr, Scott P.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,"Bernstein, EE (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ebernstein@g.harvard.edu,"Bernstein, Emily/AAH-1913-2021","van der Does, Floor/0000-0001-6311-605X; Bernstein, Emily/0000-0001-8609-3153",Sackler Scholar Programme in Psychobiology,This work was supported by the Sackler Scholar Programme in Psychobiology.,,46,2,2,1,7,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0882-2689,1573-3505,,J PSYCHOPATHOL BEHAV,J.

For example, hippocampal inactivation prevents the renewal of fear to an extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS) when it is presented outside the extinction context. Renewal of extinguished responding is accompanied by associative novelty (an unexpected occurrence of a familiar CS in a familiar place), the detection of which may require the hippocampus. We therefore examined whether the hippocampus also mediates the recovery of extinguished fear caused by other unexpected events, including presenting a familiar CS in a novel context or presenting a novel cue with the CS in a familiar context (e.g., external disinhibition). Rats underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction using an auditory CS and freezing behavior served as the index of conditioned fear. In Experiment 1, conditioned freezing to the extinguished CS was renewed in a novel context and this was eliminated by intra-hippocampal infusions of the GABA(A) agonist, muscimol, prior to the test. In Experiment 2, muscimol inactivation of the hippocampus reduced the external disinhibition of conditioned freezing that occurred when a novel white noise accompanied the extinguished tone CS. Collectively, these results suggest that the hippocampus mediates the return of fear when extinguished CSs are unexpected, or when unexpected stimuli accompany CS presentation. Ultimately, a violation of expectations about when, where, and with what other stimuli an extinguished CS will occur may form the basis of spontaneous recovery, renewal, and external disinhibition.

We adapted the FID paradigm to investigate how fast-or slow-attacking virtual predators constrain escape decisions. We show that rapid escape decisions rely on reactive fear circuits in the periaqueductal gray and midcingulate cortex (MCC), while protracted escape decisions, defined by larger buffer zones, were associated with cognitive fear circuits, which include posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, circuits implicated in more complex information processing, cognitive avoidance strategies, and behavioral flexibility. Using a Bayesian decision-making model, we further show that optimization of escape decisions under rapid flight were localized to the MCC, a region involved in adaptive motor control, while the hippocampus is implicated in optimizing decisions that update and control slower escape initiation. These results demonstrate an unexplored link between defensive survival circuits and their role in adaptive escape decisions.","[Qi, Song; Mobbs, Dean] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA; [Qi, Song; Sun, Jiayin] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hassabis, Demis] Google DeepMind, London N1C 4AG, England; [Sun, Jiayin] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Guo, Fangjian] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Daw, Nathaniel] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Qi, S; Mobbs, D (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA.; Qi, S (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sqi@caltech.edu; dmobbs@caltech.edu,,,National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and DepressionNARSAD; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH094258] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank John O'Doherty, Peter Dayan, Alex Shackman, James Curley, and Joe LeDoux for their advice and Nir Jacoby for his work on an earlier version of the paradigm.

In humans, while there is evidence that the opioid antagonist naloxone acutely enhances the acquisition of conditioned fear, there are no corresponding data on the effect of opioid agonists in moderating responses to fear. We investigated whether a single 0.2 mg administration of the mu-opioid agonist buprenorphine would decrease fear sensitivity with an emotion-recognition paradigm. Healthy human subjects participated in a randomized placebo-controlled within-subject design, in which they performed a dynamic emotion recognition task 120 min after administration of buprenorphine and placebo. In the recognition task, basic emotional expressions were morphed between their full expression and neutral in 2% steps, and presented as dynamic video-clips with final frames of different emotional intensity for each trial, which allows for a fine-grained measurement of emotion sensitivity. Additionally, visual analog scales were used to investigate acute effects of buprenorphine on mood. Compared to placebo, buprenorphine resulted in a significant reduction in the sensitivity for recognizing fearful facial expressions exclusively. Our data demonstrate, for the first time in humans, that acute up-regulation of the opioid system reduces fear recognition sensitivity. Moreover, the absence of an effect of buprenorphine on mood provides evidence of a direct influence of opioids upon the core fear system in the human brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a difficult task because of the dearth of studies to identify these types of events. However, it is possible to examine and identify human and organizational errors (HOEs) within fire risk situations. Many errors identified in fire risk environments are due to human factors that can be changed through employee training and development. In addition, many organizational factors, such as safety culture, can be changed over time through transformational interventions that shift existing mindsets. This paper presents a systematic review to identify errors due to human and organizational factors that apply to and potentially affect risk estimates in fire safety modelling of high-rise buildings. First, the paper describes the types of errors that occur in fire risk situations and then provides a review that categorizes and links human and organizational factors. The paper is both a qualitative and quantitative review, drawing on research from quantitative studies and case studies, including the Grenfell Fire. The review offers insights and recommendations to incorporate human and organizational risks into probabilistic risk analyses and suggests future directions for research.","[Tan, Samson; Moinuddin, Khalid] Victoria Univ, Inst Sustainable Ind & Liveable Cities, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",,"Tan, S (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Inst Sustainable Ind & Liveable Cities, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",samson.tan@live.vu.edu.au,"TAN, SAMSON/AAK-7899-2021; Moinuddin, Khalid/J-1087-2017","TAN, SAMSON/0000-0003-0419-3826; Moinuddin, Khalid/0000-0002-1831-6754",,,,115,14,15,12,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-8320,1879-0836,,RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE,Reliab.

As PTSD patients have exaggerated startle responses, a fear-potentiated startle paradigm in rats may have face validity as an animal model to examine the efficacy of oxytocin in treating these symptoms. Oxytocin (0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mu g, subcutaneously) was given either 30 min before fear conditioning, immediately after fear conditioning, or 30 min before fear-potentiated startle testing to assess its effects on acquisition, consolidation, and expression of conditioned fear, respectively. Startle both in the presence and absence of the fear-conditioned light was significantly diminished by oxytocin when administered at acquisition, consolidation, or expression. There was no specific effect of oxytocin on light fear-potentiated startle. In an additional experiment, oxytocin had no effects on acoustic startle without previous fear conditioning. Further, in a context-conditioned test, previous light-shock fear conditioning did not increase acoustic startle during testing when the fear-conditioned light was not presented. The data suggest that oxytocin did not diminish cue-specific conditioned nor contextually conditioned fear, but reduced background anxiety. This suggests that oxytocin has unique effects of decreasing background anxiety without affecting learning and memory of a specific traumatic event. Oxytocin may have antianxiety properties that are particularly germane to the hypervigilance and exaggerated startle typically seen in PTSD patients.

Although prior studies have found that fear generalization magnitudes are qualitatively related to the degree of perceptual similarity to the threatening stimulus, the precise relationship between these two functions has not been measured systematically. Also, it remains unknown whether fear generalization mechanisms differ for social and non-social information. To examine these questions, we measured perceptual discrimination and fear generalization in the same subjects, using images of human faces and non-face control stimuli (blobs) that were perceptually matched to the faces. First, each subject's ability to discriminate between pairs of faces or blobs was measured. Each subject then underwent a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure, in which each of the paired conditioned stimuli (CS) were either followed (CS+) or not followed (CS-) by a shock. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) were also measured. Subjects were then presented with the CS+, CS- and five levels of a CS+-to-CS- morph continuum between the paired stimuli, which were identified based on individual discrimination thresholds. Finally, subjects rated the likelihood that each stimulus had been followed by a shock. Subjects showed both autonomic (SCR based) and conscious (ratings-based) fear responses to morphs that they could not discriminate from the CS+ (generalization). For both faces and non-face objects, fear generalization was not found above discrimination thresholds. However, subjects exhibited greater fear generalization in the shock likelihood ratings compared to the SCRs, particularly for faces. These findings reveal that autonomic threat detection mechanisms in humans are highly sensitive to small perceptual differences between stimuli. Also, the conscious evaluation of threat shows broader generalization than autonomic responses, biased towards labeling a stimulus as threatening.","[Holt, Daphne J.; Boeke, Emily A.; Wolthusen, Rick P.

Subsequent long-term changes in fear behaviors not only depend on associative learning processes during those phases but also on memory consolidation processes and the later ability to retrieve and express fear and extinction memories. Clinical theories explain relapse after successful exposure-based treatment with return of fear memories and remission with stable extinction memory expression. We probed contextual fear and extinction memories 1 week (Day8) after conditioning (Day1) and subsequent extinction (Day2) by presenting conditioned contexts before (Test1) and after (Test2) a reinstatement manipulation. We find consistent activation patterns in two independent samples: activation of a subgenual part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex before reinstatement (Test1) and (albeit with different temporal profiles between samples) of the amygdala after reinstatement (Test2) as well as up-regulation of anterior hippocampus activity after reinstatement (Test2 > Test1). These areas have earlier been implicated in the expression of cued extinction and fear memories. The present results suggest a general role for these structures in defining the balance between fear and extinction memories, independent of the conditioning mode. The results are discussed in the light of hypotheses implicating the anterior hippocampus in the processing of situational ambiguity.","[Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Haaker, Jan; Kalisch, Raffael] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf UKE, Inst Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Kalisch, Raffael] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Med Ctr, Focus Program Translat Neurosci FTN, Neuroimaging Ctr Mainz NIC, D-55131 Mainz, Germany",,"Lonsdorf, TB (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf UKE, Inst Syst Neurosci, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",,"Kalisch, Raffael/H-6624-2016; Kalisch, Raffael/A-9863-2018; Lonsdorf, Tina/K-8657-2017; Haaker, Jan/J-4670-2014","Haaker, Jan/0000-0001-8366-9559; Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846","State of Hamburg excellence initiative (neurodapt! consortium); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [KA 1623/3-1, KA 1623/4-1, SFB TRR58]","We thank Dr Alexandra Thanellou for help with paradigm development and Dr Matthias Gamer for providing software for the SCR scoring.

Importantly, contextual information may strongly modulate such conditioned responses (CR), however, there are several methodological boundaries in the translation of animal findings to humans, and from healthy individuals to patients. Virtual Reality (VR) is a useful technological tool for overcoming such boundaries. In this review, we summarize and evaluate human VR conditioning studies exploring the role of the context as conditioned stimulus or occasion setter for CRs. We observe that VR allows successful acquisition of conditioned anxiety and conditioned fear in response to virtual contexts and virtual cues, respectively. VR studies also revealed that spatial or temporal contextual information determine whether conditioned anxiety and conditioned fear become extinguished and/or return. Novel contexts resembling the threatening context foster conditioned fear but not conditioned anxiety, suggesting distinct context-related generalization processes. We conclude VR contexts are able to strongly modulate CRs and therefore allow a comprehensive investigation of the modulatory role of the context over CR in humans leading to conclusions relevant for non-VR and clinical studies.","[Andreatta, Marta; Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Biol Psychol, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Andreatta, Marta] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ Sci& Child Studies, Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Mental Hlth, Wurzburg, Germany",,"Andreatta, M; Pauli, P (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Biol Psychol, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.; Andreatta, M (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ Sci& Child Studies, Burg Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",andreatta@essb.eur.nl; pauli@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,,,"German Research Foundation (DFG) Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders [TRR 58]","The work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders TRR 58, project B1 to PP and project B08 to MA.

Combining psychophysical testing and neurometric analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) in a fear detection task with parametrically varied fear intensities (N=45), we sought to elucidate key processes in fear perception. Building on psychophysics marking fear perception thresholds, our neurometric model fitting identified several putative operations and stages: four key processes arose in sequence following face presentation - fear-neutral categorization (P1 at 100 ms), fear detection (P300 at 320 ms), valuation (early subcomponent of the late positive potential/LPP at 400-500 ms) and conscious awareness (late subcomponent LPP at 500-600 ms). Furthermore, within-subject brain-behavior association suggests that initial emotion categorization was mandatory and detached from behavior whereas valuation and conscious awareness directly impacted behavioral outcome (explaining 17% and 31% of the total variance, respectively). The current study thus reveals the chronometry of fear perception, ascribing psychological meaning to distinct underlying processes. The combination of early categorization and late valuation of fear reconciles conflicting (categorical versus dimensional) emotion accounts, lending support to a hybrid model. Importantly, future research could specifically interrogate these psychological processes in various behaviors and psychopathologies (e.g., anxiety and depression). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, the behavioral procedure used to modify this trace is the so-called postretrieval extinction, consisting of fear-memory reactivation followed by extinction applied within the reconsolidation window. However, the application of this technique yields mixed results, probably due to a series of boundary conditions that limit the effectiveness of postretrieval-extinction effects. In this study a number of potential, and hitherto unexplored, moderators of such effects are considered. Using an interval of 48 hr between extinction and re-extinction, the findings show a spontaneous recovery similar to that found in studies that use a 24-hr interval. Also, the use of intervals of 10 and 20 min between reactivation and extinction led to a similar fear return. Finally, the burst of white noise used as an unconditioned stimulus (US) here was shown to be as effective as the electric shock normally used in the study of fear-memory reconsolidation. These findings suggest that postretrieval extinction is an effective behavioral technique for modifying the original fear memory and for the elimination of the fear return.","[Fernandez-Rey, Jose; Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Daniel; Redondo, Jaime] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Psychol, Cognit Proc & Behav Lab, Campus Vida, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",,"Fernandez-Rey, J (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Psychol, Cognit Proc & Behav Lab, Campus Vida, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",jose.fernandez.rey@usc.es,"FERNANDEZ-REY, JOSE/A-4831-2010","FERNANDEZ-REY, JOSE/0000-0002-8023-7643; Redondo, Jaime/0000-0002-0161-9601",Autonomous Government of Galicia [GRC2015/006],"This study was supported by the Autonomous Government of Galicia (Grant GRC2015/006).

A factorial design allowed us to investigate brain activity induced by viewing bodies, bodily expressions of fear and the role of dynamic information in viewing them. Our critical findings are threefold. We find that viewing neutral and fearful body expressions enhances amygdala activity; moreover actions expressing fear activate the temporal pole and lateral orbital cortex more than neutral actions; and finally differences in activations between static and dynamic bodily expressions were larger for actions expressing fear in the STS and premotor cortex compared to neutral actions.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of mild tone exposure (CS) during slow wave sleep (SWS) on fear memory extinction in humans. Design: The healthy volunteers underwent an auditory fear conditioning paradigm on the experimental night, during which tones served as the CS, and a mild shock served as the US. They were then randomly assigned to four groups. Three groups were exposed to the CS for 3 or 10 min or an irrelevant tone (control stimulus, CtrS) for 10 min during SWS. The fourth group served as controls and was not subjected to any interventions. All of the subjects completed a memory test 4 h after SWS-rich stage to evaluate the effect on fear extinction. Moreover, we conducted similar experiments using an independent group of subjects during the daytime to test whether the memory extinction effect was specific to the sleep condition. Participants: Ninety-six healthy volunteers (44 males) aged 18-28 y. Measurements and Results: Participants exhibited undisturbed sleep during 2 consecutive nights, as assessed by sleep variables (all P > 0.05) from polysomnographic recordings and power spectral analysis. Participants who were re-exposed to the 10 min CS either during SWS and wakefulness exhibited attenuated fear responses (wake-10 min CS, P < 0.05; SWS-10 min CS, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Conditioned stimulus re-exposure during slow wave sleep promoted fear memory extinction without altering sleep profiles.","[He, Jia; Sun, Hong-Qiang; Zhang, Wei-Hua; Li, Xiao-Jun; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Hosp 6, Inst Mental Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [He, Jia; Sun, Hong-Qiang; Zhang, Wei-Hua; Li, Xiao-Jun; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Key Lab Mental Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [He, Jia; Li, Su-Xia; Shi, Jie; Ai, Si-Zhi; Lu, Lin] Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yun; Tang, Xiang-Dong] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Translat Neurosci Ctr, Sleep Med Ctr, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",,"Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Mental Hlth, 51,Huayuan Bei Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",xiangdong.tang@gmail.com; linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,"Li, Su-Xia/AAR-6218-2021","Li, Yun/0000-0001-6276-9104; Tang, Xiangdong/0000-0001-6876-3328","Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81271489, 31230033, 81171251, 81328010]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB856400]","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81271489, 31230033, 81171251, and 81328010) and the National Basic Research Program of China (no. 2015CB856400).

In humans and rodents alike, fear conditioning is amygdala-dependent and rests on similar neurocircuitry. Rodent studies have implicated a causative role for dopamine in the amygdala during fear memory formation, but the role of dopamine in aversive learning in humans is unclear. Here, we show dopamine release in the amygdala and striatum during fear learning in humans. Using simultaneous positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that the amount of dopamine release is linked to strength of conditioned fear responses and linearly coupled to learning-induced activity in the amygdala. Thus, like in rodents, formation of amygdala-dependent fear memories in humans seems to be facilitated by endogenous dopamine release, supporting an evolutionary conserved neurochemical mechanism for aversive memory formation.","[Frick, Andreas] Uppsala Univ, Dept Neurosci, Beijer Lab, Psychiat, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bjorkstrand, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Psychol, Lund, Sweden; [Bjorkstrand, Johannes; Fredrikson, Mats] Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Lubberink, Mark] Uppsala Univ, Dept Surg Sci Nucl Med & PET, Uppsala, Sweden; [Eriksson, Allison] Uppsala Univ, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, Uppsala, Sweden; [Fredrikson, Mats] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Ahs, Fredrik] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Psychol & Social Work, Ostersund, Sweden",,"Frick, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Neurosci, Beijer Lab, Psychiat, Uppsala, Sweden.",andreas.frick@neuro.uu.se,"Frick, Andreas/D-1882-2015","Frick, Andreas/0000-0003-2516-9075",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Swedish Brain Foundation; Swedish Society for Medical Research; Kjell and Marta Beijer Foundation; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond - the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences; Heumanska stiftelsen,"We thank the staff at the Uppsala PET/MR facility and Uppsala PET Center for invaluable help with data collection.

Fear of falling (FOF) is a significant risk factor for falls, yet we know little about how FOF varies by race/ethnicity. The purpose of this original research brief was to investigate the relationship between race/ethnicity and FOF among older adults. Methods 4,981 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) who had not self-reported a fall in the past 12 months were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between race/ethnicity and fear of falling, controlling for sex, age, total annual income, and mobility assistance. Results FOF differed significantly across racial groups. Black, non-Hispanic older adults were less likely to have FOF (OR = .87, 95% CI = .71,1.07) compared with their White, non-Hispanic counterparts. In the fully adjusted model, this difference persisted and became stronger (adjusted OR = .75, 95%CI = .61, .93). Conclusion The decreased risk for falls in Black older adults could be explained by lower FOF in this group. Clinical Implications These findings should inform public health fall prevention initiatives among community-dwelling older adults.","[Singh, Tanvee; Belanger, Emmanuelle; Thomas, Kali] Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Policy & Practice, Ctr Gerontol & Healthcare Res, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Thomas, Kali] Brown Univ, Ctr Innovat Longterm Serv & Supports, Providence VA Med Ctr, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"Singh, T (corresponding author), Box G-S121-3,121 S Main St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",tanvee_singh@brown.edu,,"Belanger, Emmanuelle/0000-0001-7301-0451; Thomas, Kali/0000-0003-3436-2184; Singh, Tanvee/0000-0003-4572-833X",NIA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [U01 AG032947] Funding Source: Medline; Intramural VA [CDA 14-422] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [U01AG032947] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,28,7,7,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0731-7115,1545-2301,,CLIN GERONTOLOGIST,Clin.

Researchers are beginning to identify brain sites associated with conditioned contextual fear such as the ventral anterior olfactory nucleus, dorsal premammillary nucleus, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, cuneiform nucleus, and locus coeruleus. In addition, a few studies have reported an involvement of the basolateral and medial nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampus in fear conditioning. However, several important issues concerning the effectiveness of different predator odor unconditioned stimuli to produce fear conditioning, the precise role of brain nuclei in fear conditioning, and the general relation between the current predator odor and the traditional electric foot-shock fear conditioning procedures remain to be satisfactorily addressed. This review discusses the major behavioral results in the current predator odor fear conditioning literature and introduces two novel contextual and auditory fear conditioning models using cat odor. The new models provide critical information on the acquisition of conditioned fear behavior during training and the expression of conditioned responses in the retention test. Future studies adopting fear conditioning procedures that incorporate measures of both unconditioned and conditioned responses during training may lead to broad insights into predator odor fear conditioning and identify specific brain nuclei mediating conditioned stimulus-predator odor unconditioned stimulus associations.

Fear reactions of nonpregnant (NP; N=22) and pregnant (P) Ile-de-France ewes (day 40 of pregnancy: N=43; day 140 of pregnancy: N=19) were compared during three situations classically reported to induce fear in sheep: isolation, surprise, and the presence of a human. P ewes displayed significantly lower fear reactions than NP ewes when isolated and when confronted with a surprise effect combined with the appearance of a novel object. This reduction in fearfulness may be mediated principally through reduced fear of isolation. However, fear of a human remained constant despite pregnancy. Fear reactions of ewes tested during isolation on gestation day 40 or 140 did not differ, suggesting that decreased fear is not restricted to the latest stage of pregnancy. A negative correlation was found between plasma progesterone levels and fear during isolation and surprise tests;of ewes with low levels of progesterone. The decrease in fearfulness during pregnancy may have some adaptative value for the survival of the young. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Animal models for translational research offer insight into basic behavioral and neurophysiological factors mediating the acquisition, expression, inhibition, and generalization of fear. However, it is important to consider the limits of traditional animal models when applied to humans. Here, we focus on the question of how humans generalize fear. We propose that to understand fear generalization in humans requires taking into account research on higher-level cognition such as category-based induction, inferential reasoning, and representation of conceptual knowledge.

The analysis finds that there are segments of the population defined by demographics and attitudes that are more fearful of the automation of their jobs than others. Additionally, we see that attitudes towards the dehumanizing effects of automation, peer-pressure, job automatability, and a person's self-perception of professionalism are the main drivers of the fear of automation.

This is a potentially important finding considering that the failure to acquire fear contingencies can leave an individual in a maladaptive state of more generalized anxiety. Consistent with that idea, the CRHR1-dependent fear acquisition deficit translated into heightened contextual anxiety when taking genetic variability within the serotonin transporter long polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) into account. To replicate our previous findings, we conducted a replication study in 224 healthy medication-free human subjects using the exact same cue and context virtual reality fear-conditioning procedure as in study by Heitland et al. (2013). In the replication study, consistent with the original findings, CRHR1 rs878886 G-allele carriers showed reduced acquisition of cue-specific fear-conditioned responses compared with C/C homozygotes. Also, in this larger sample the cue acquisition deficit of G-allele carriers translated into heightened contextual anxiety, even independent of 5-HTT gene variation. In contrast to our earlier findings, there was an additional interaction effect of CRHR1 rs878886 and the triallelic 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 variant on cued fear acquisition. In summary, this study replicated the initially reported association of the CRHR1 rs878886 G-allele with cued fear acquisition deficits, albeit with a different pattern of results regarding the interaction with 5-HTT variation. This further supports the notion that the human corticotropin-releasing hormone plays a role in the acquisition of fears.","[Heitland, I.; van Gool, J. M.; Baas, J. M.

In rodents, fear memory is stored and reactivated under the influence of the amygdala. There is no evidence for an equivalent mechanism in primates, and an opposite mechanism is proposed whereby primate amygdala contributes only to an initial phase of aversive learning, subsequently ceding fear memory to extra-amygdalar regions. Here, we reexamine this question by exploiting human high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with multivariate methods. By assuming a sparse neural coding, we show it is possible, at an individual subject level, to discriminate responses to conditioned (CS+ and CS-) stimuli in both basolateral and centro-cortical amygdala nuclei. The strength of this discrimination increased over time and was tightly coupled to the behavioral expression of fear, consistent with an expression of a stable fear memory trace. These data highlight that the human basolateral and centro-cortical amygdala support initial learning as well more enduring fear memory storage. A sparse neuronal representation for fear, here revealed by multivariate pattern classification, resolves why an enduring memory trace has proven elusive in previous human studies.","[Bach, Dominik R.; Weiskopf, Nikolaus; Dolan, Raymond J.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England",,"Bach, DR (corresponding author), UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, 12 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.",d.bach@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk,"Weiskopf, Nikolaus/B-9357-2008; Bach, Dominik/B-4302-2019","Weiskopf, Nikolaus/0000-0001-5239-1881; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X; Bach, Dominik/0000-0003-3717-2036",Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission; Max PlanckMax Planck Society,"This work was supported by a program grant and strategic award from the Wellcome Trust and a Max Planck Research Award from the Max Planck Gesellschaft to R.J.D.

Most neuroimaging studies to date have been provocation studies which present a trauma-related stimulus and measure response. While providing information about PTSD, these complex studies were not designed to target specific emotions. Studies which can specifically elicit fear or anxiety and evaluate associated brain regions, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may provide a clearer understanding of the biologic underpinnings of PTSD and bridge the knowledge between animal neurobiology and human studies.

It is worth noting that explicit and implicit fear processing produces different behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. The present study capitalizes on the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method of meta-analysis to identify: (a) the core network of fear processing in healthy individuals; (b) common and specific neural activations associated with explicit and implicit processing of fear. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 92 fMRI and PET studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall analysis show that the core fear network comprises the amygdala, pulvinar, and fronto-occipital regions. Both implicit and explicit fear processing activated amygdala, declive, fusiform gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that these two types of fear processing share a common neural substrate. Explicit fear processing elicited more activations at the pulvinar and parahippocampal gyrus, suggesting visual attention/orientation and contextual association play important roles during explicit fear processing. In contrast, implicit fear processing elicited more activations at the cerebellumamygdala-cortical pathway, indicating an 'alarm' system underlying implicit fear processing. These findings have shed light on the neural mechanism underlying fear processing at different levels of awareness.","[Tao, Di; He, Zonglin; Lin, Yuchen; Liu, Chang] Jinan Univ, Int Sch, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Tao, Qian] Jinan Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Sch Basic Med, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Tao, Qian] Jinan Univ, Div Med Psychol & Behav Sci, Sch Basic Med, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Tao, Qian] Ctr Brain Sci & Brain Inspired Intelligence, Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China",,"Tao, Q (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Div Med Psychol & Behav Sci, Sch Basic Med, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.",taoqian16@jnu.edu.cn,,"Tao, Qian/0000-0002-9725-1871; He, Zonglin/0000-0001-7650-1459; Lin, Yu Chen/0000-0002-5785-1151","National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFC2005800, 2020YFC2005802]; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou [202007030012]; Science and Technology Program of Guangdong [2018B030334001]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31970990]","This study was supported by research grants from the National Key R&D Program of China (2020YFC2005800, 2020YFC2005802); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou (202007030012); Science and Technology Program of Guangdong (2018B030334001); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31970990).",,121,4,4,8,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1053-8119,1095-9572,,NEUROIMAGE,Neuroimage,FEB 15,2021,227,,,,,,,,117686,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117686,,,11,"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",QG0NA,WOS:000617281900047,33359340,gold,,,2022-04-16,

Increased attention to threat has been shown to yield improved treatment outcomes in anxious patients following exposure-based therapy. This study examined whether increasing attention to learned stimuli during fear extinction, an experimental analogue for exposure-based treatments, could improve extinction learning and its maintenance. Methods: Sixty-five healthy adults were randomized into experimental or control conditions. All completed a differential fear conditioning task. During extinction, a subtle attentional manipulation was implemented in the experimental group, designed to increase participants' attention to both threat and safety cues. Three days later, an extinction recall test was conducted using the original cues and two perceptually similar morphs. Results: Fear conditioning was achieved in both behavioral and psychophysiological measures. In addition, between-group differences emerged during extinction. The experimental group exhibited increased attention to stimuli and lower fear responses in physiological measure than the control group. Similarly, during extinction recall, the experimental group exhibited lower startle responses than the control group. Last, across groups, attending to the safety cue during extinction was associated with lower self-reported risk of the two generalization morphs displayed during extinction recall. Limitations: Skin conductance response (SCR) was not measured during extinction recall. Future research should include both SCR and additional generalization morphs so as to allow for the examination of more subtle individual differences. Conclusions: Results indicate that the attentional manipulation increased attention allocation to stimuli during extinction; this, in turn, affected fear-related physiological response.","[Klein, Zohar; Ginat-Frolich, Rivkah; Shechner, Tomer] Univ Haifa, Sch Psychol Sci, Abba Hushi 199, Haifa, Israel; [Klein, Zohar; Ginat-Frolich, Rivkah; Shechner, Tomer] Univ Haifa, Integrated Brain & Behav Res Ctr, Abba Hushi 199, Haifa, Israel; [Barry, Tom J.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Barry, Tom J.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England",,"Shechner, T (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Sch Psychol Sci, Abba Hushi 199, Haifa, Israel.",tshechner@psy.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,43,0,0,2,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7916,1873-7943,,J BEHAV THER EXP PSY,J.

This experimental design allowed us to examine the effects of associative learning, presentation of the conditioning stimuli, and presentation of the unconditioned stimuli on sleep-wake states. During the 24 hr after training, fear-conditioned mice had approximately 1 hr more of nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and less wakefulness than mice receiving exposure to conditioning stimuli or immediate shock treatment. Mice receiving conditioning stimuli had more delta power during NREM sleep, whereas mice receiving fear conditioning had less theta power during rapid-eye-movement sleep. These results demonstrate that a single trial of fear conditioning alters sleep-wake states and EEG oscillations over a 24-hr period, supporting the idea that sleep is modified by experience and that such changes in sleep-wake states and EEG oscillations may play a role in memory consolidation.","Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Lynch Labs 204G, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Neurosci Grad Grp, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Neurobiol Pharmacol & Physiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Abel, T (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Lynch Labs 204G, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",abele@sas.upenn.edu,"Hellman, Kevin/V-8899-2019; Abel, Ted/AAX-2825-2021","Hellman, Kevin/0000-0001-9420-5602; Abel, Ted/0000-0003-2423-4592","NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [P50 HL060287-070006, HL-60287, P50 HL060287] Funding Source: Medline; NIA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P01 AG017628, AG-18199, P01 AG017628-070006] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH-64329, MH-60244, R01 MH060244, F31 MH064329] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [P50HL060287] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F31MH064329, R01MH060244] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P01AG017628, R01AG018199] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,93,39,39,1,7,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

Two circles of different sizes served as conditioned stimuli (CS+ and CS-), before testing with a range of circle sizes. In Experiment 1, shock expectancy ratings followed a peak-shifted unimodal gradient, with maximum ratings at a test value further along the dimension from CS+ in the opposite direction to CS-. However, differentiable gradients were observed when participants were divided on the basis of the rules they reported using during the task (linear and similarity). Experiment 2 was designed to counter the contradictory feedback arising from extinction testing by removing the shock electrodes during the test phase. A more linear overall gradient was observed, and sub-groups defined by self-reported rules showed distinct gradients that were congruent with their rules. These results indicate that rule-based processes are influential in generalisation of conditioned fear along simple stimulus dimensions, and may help explain generalisation phenomena that have traditionally been attributed to automatic, similarity-based processes.","[Ahmed, Ola; Lovibond, Peter F.] UNSW Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,"Lovibond, PF (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",p.lovibond@unsw.edu.au,,,Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP160101907],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Preparation of this manuscript was supported by grant DP160101907 from the Australian Research Council.",,56,7,7,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-0218,1747-0226,,Q J EXP PSYCHOL,Q.

Understanding how wildlife balance these trade-offs in anthropogenic environments is crucial to develop effective strategies to reduce risks of negative interactions, including bi-directional aggression and disease transmission. For the first time, we use a landscape of fear framework with Bayesian spatiotemporal modelling to investigate anthropogenic risk-mitigation and optimal foraging trade-offs in Critically Endangered western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Using 12 months of camera trap data (21 camera traps, 6722 camera trap days) and phenology on wild and cultivated plant species collected at Caiquene-Cadique, Cantanhez National Park (Guinea-Bissau), we show that humans and chimpanzees broadly overlapped in their use of forest and anthropogenic parts of the habitat including villages and cultivated areas. The spatiotemporal model showed that chimpanzee use of space was predicted by the availability of naturalised oil-palm fruit. Chimpanzees used areas away from villages and agriculture more intensively, but optimised their foraging strategies by increasing their use of village areas with cultivated fruits when wild fruits were scarce. Our modelling approach generates fine-resolution space-time output maps, which can be scaled-up to identify human-wildlife interaction hotspots at the landscape level, informing coexistence strategy.","[Bersacola, Elena; Hockings, Kimberley J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Bersacola, Elena; Hill, Catherine M.] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Social Sci, Oxford, England; [Bersacola, Elena; Hockings, Kimberley J.] Ctr Res Anthropol CRIA, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Bersacola, E (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.; Bersacola, E (corresponding author), Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Social Sci, Oxford, England.; Bersacola, E (corresponding author), Ctr Res Anthropol CRIA, Lisbon, Portugal.",e.bersacola@exeter.ac.uk,,"Bersacola, Elena/0000-0003-3814-8687; Hockings, Kimberley/0000-0002-6187-644X",FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [IF/01128/2014/CP1233/CT0002]; Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [152510653]; Conservation International/Global Wildlife Conservation's Primate Action Fund; Primate Society of Great Britain; International Primatological Society; Darwin Initiative funding United Kingdom [26-018]; Primate Conservation Inc,"We thank the Instituto da Biodiversidade e das Areas Protegidas (IBAP) particularly Dr Alfredo Simao da Silva, Aissa Regalla, Queba Quecuta, Dr Justino Biai and Dr Abilio Rachid Said for their permission to conduct research in Guinea-Bissau and for logistical support.

In the context of the pediatric pain experience, parent distress:and behaviors can be highly influential. This study validated the Parent Fear of Pain Questionnaire (PFOPQ) to assess a parent's fears and avoidance behaviors associated with their child's pain. Using the,PFOPQ in conjunction with measures of parent and child pain-related variables, we tested the interpersonal fear-avoidance model (IFAM). The sample comprised 321 parents and their child with chronic or new-onset pain who presented to a multidisciplinary outpatient pain clinic. An exploratory factor analysis yielded a 4-factor structure for the PFOPQ consisting of Fear of Pain, Fear of Movement, Fear Of School, and Avoidance. As hypothesized, Fear of Pain was most closely related to parent pain catastrophizing and child fear of pain, whereas Avoidance was most closely related to parent protective behaviors and child avoidance of activities. In testing the rpm, parent behavior contributed directly and indirectly to child avoidance, whereas parent fear and catastrophizing contributed indirectly to child avoidance through parent behavior and child fear and catastrophizing, in turn, influencing child functional disability levels. This study provides the first measure of parent pain-related fears and avoidance behaviors and evaluates the theorized IFAM. These results underscore the important influence of parents on child pain-related outcomes and put forth a psychometrically Sound Measure to asses parent fear and avoidance in the context of their child's pain.","[Simons, Laura E.; Smith, Allison; Kaczynski, Karen; Basch, Molly] Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Div Pain Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simons, Laura E.; Smith, Allison; Kaczynski, Karen] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Simons, LE (corresponding author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Div Pain Med, 21 Autumn St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",laura.simons@childrens.harvard.edu,,"Simons, Laura E./0000-0002-3395-9483",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NICHD K23H0067202]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [K23HD067202] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This investigation was supported by NIH Grant to LS (NICHD K23H0067202) Sara Page Mayo Endowment for Pediatric Pain Research and Treatment.

Two alternative hypotheses were tested, namely a general negative evaluative state hypothesis and a discrete emotion hypothesis. These hypotheses suggest 2 distinctive data patterns for muscle activation and classification speed of facial expressions. The pattern of results that would support a discrete emotions perspective would be expected to reveal significantly increased activity in the medial frontalis (eyebrow raiser) and corrugator supercilii (frown) muscles associated with fear, and significantly decreased reaction times (RTs) to only fear faces in the fear odor condition. Conversely, a pattern of results characterized by only a significantly increased corrugator supercilii activity together with decreased RTs for fear, disgust, and anger faces in the fear odor condition would support an interpretation in line with a general negative evaluative state perspective.

This aversion appears to create refugia for deer, as deer more than doubled their relative activity near (<70 m) human development. In addition, deer more than quadrupled their consumption of woody vegetation at low-risk sites close to humans relative to comparable high-risk sites far from humans and consumed a greater percent of the forage available in sites near humans than in comparable sites farther away. Increased browsing by deer in near human, or low-risk, sites induced woody plants to become bushier (by removing apical dominance) than those away from humans, or high-risk sites. The cascading interactions from pumas avoiding people to changes in plant architecture appear to have increased available food to deer (i.e., bushier plants have more available branch ends providing potential bites of food than less bushy individuals) and may have other, as yet undocumented, ecological effects.","[Yovovich, Veronica; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Yovovich, Veronica] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 145 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thomsen, Meredith] Univ Wisconsin, Biol Dept, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Thomsen, Meredith] Univ Wisconsin, River Studies Ctr, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA",,"Yovovich, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.; Yovovich, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 145 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",vyovovich@gmail.com,,"Thomsen, Meredith/0000-0001-9843-5202","California Department of Fish and Wildlife; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913, 0963022]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; American Museum of Natural History; University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Department","We thank the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for their support of funding and staff; B.

However, empirical assessments of the effectiveness of fear appeals have yielded mixed results, leading IS security scholars and practitioners to question the validity of the conventional fear appeal framework and the manner in which fear appeal behavioral modeling theories, such as protection motivation theory (PMT), have been applied to the study of information security phenomena. We contend that the conventional fear appeal rhetorical framework is inadequate when used in the context of information security threat warnings and that its primary behavioral modeling theory, PMT, has been misspecified in the extant information security research. Based on these arguments, we propose an enhanced fear appeal rhetorical framework that leverages sanctioning rhetoric as a secondary vector of threats to the human asset, thereby adding the dimension of personal relevance, which is critically absent from previous fear appeal frameworks and PMT-grounded security studies. Following a hypothetical scenario research approach involving the employees of a Finnish city government, we validate the efficacy of the enhanced fear appeal framework and determine that informal sanction rhetoric effectively enhances conventional fear appeals, thus providing a significant positive influence on compliance intentions.","[Johnston, Allen C.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Collat Sch Business, Dept Management & Informat Syst, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Warkentin, Merrill] Mississippi State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Management & Informat Syst, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Siponen, Mikko] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland",,"Johnston, AC (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Collat Sch Business, Dept Management & Informat Syst, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",ajohnston@uab.edu; mwarkentin@acm.org; mikko.t.siponen@jyu.fi,"Warkentin, Merrill/E-4702-2015","Warkentin, Merrill/0000-0001-7435-7676",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland; Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES)Finnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES),"We thank the anonymous reviewer who provided the discerning perspective on our theoretical contributions and the role of our work in the context of the extant published literature on PMT and deterrence.

There appears to be a discrepancy between understanding systemic risk from a natural-science perspective and the unresolved challenges that arise when humans with their initiatives and interactions are included in systemic-risk considerations. It is therefore necessary to investigate possible fundamental differences and similarities of systemic risk with and without accounting for human involvement. Focusing on applied and implementation aspects of measuring, modeling, and managing systemic risks, we identify three important and distinct features characterizing such fundamental differences: indetermination, indecision, and responsibility. We contend that, first, including human initiatives and interactions in systemic-risk considerations must emphasize a type of variability that is especially relevant in this context, namely the role of free will as a fundamental source of essential indetermination in human agency. Second, we postulate that collective indecision generated by mutual uncertainty often leads to the suspension or alteration of rules, procedures, scripts, and norms. Consequently, the associated systemic risks cannot be incorporated into explanatory models, as the new causal rules cannot be predicted and accounted for. Third, analogies from biology and ecology, especially the idea of 'contagion,' downplay human agency, and therefore human responsibility, promoting the false belief that systemic risk is a merely technical problem. For each of these three features, we provide recommendations for future directions and suggest how measuring, modeling, and managing approaches from the natural-science domain can best be applied in light of human agency.","[Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan; Colon, Celian; Boza, Gergely; Braennstroem, Ake; Linnerooth-Bayer, Joanne; Pflug, Georg; Poledna, Sebastian; Rovenskaya, Elena; Dieckmann, Ulf] IIASA, Schlosspl 1A, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Boza, Gergely] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Evolutionary Syst Res Grp, Tihany, Hungary; [Braennstroem, Ake] Umea Univ, Umea, Sweden; [Pflug, Georg] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Rovenskaya, Elena] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Computat Math & Cybernet, Moscow, Russia; [Dieckmann, Ulf] Complex Sci Hub, Vienna, Austria; [Dieckmann, Ulf] Grad Univ Adv Studies Sokendai, Dept Evolutionary Studies Biosyst, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan",,"Hochrainer-Stigler, S (corresponding author), IIASA, Schlosspl 1A, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",hochrain@iiasa.ac.at,"Boza, Gergely/P-8895-2015","Boza, Gergely/0000-0001-6453-8254; Bayer, Joanne/0000-0003-3084-2471; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan/0000-0002-9929-8171; Brannstrom, Ake/0000-0001-9862-816X; Rovenskaya, Elena/0000-0002-2761-3443; Poledna, Sebastian/0000-0002-5838-6570; Colon, Celian/0000-0002-4132-4648",,,,118,3,3,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

This view obscures evolutionary dynamics because fear evolved to protect against myriad threats, not merely those in the political realm. We suggest prior work in this area has been biased by selection on the dependent variable, resulting from an examination of exclusively politically oriented fears that privilege conservative values. Because the adaptation regulating fear should be based upon both universal and ancestral-specific selection pressures combined with developmental and individual differences, the elicitation of it should prove variable across the ideological continuum dependent upon specific combinations of fear and value domains. In a sample of similar to 1,600 Australians assessed with a subset of the Fear Survey Schedule II, we find fears not infused with political content are differentially influential across the political spectrum. Specifically, those who are more fearful of sharp objects, graveyards, and urinating in public are more socially conservative and less supportive of gay rights. Those who are more fearful of death are more supportive of gay rights. Those who are more fearful of suffocating and swimming alone are more concerned about emissions controls and immigration, while those who are more fearful of thunderstorms are also more anti-immigration. Contrary to existing research, both liberals and conservatives are more fearful of different circumstances, and the role of dispositional fears are attitude-specific.","[Hatemi, Peter K.] Penn State Univ, State Coll, PA 16801 USA; [McDermott, Rose] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"McDermott, R (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",phatemi@gmail.com; Rose_McDermott@Brown.edu,,"Hatemi, Peter/0000-0001-6514-2614; McDermott, Rose/0000-0002-0920-1541","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0729493,0721707]","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (0729493,0721707).",,68,1,1,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1045-6767,1936-4776,,HUM NATURE-INT BIOS,Hum.

A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been identified in the human BDNF gene (BDNF Val66Met) that leads to decreased BDNF secretion and impairments in specific forms of fear learning in adult humans and genetically modified mice containing this SNP. As the emergence of anxiety and other fear-related disorders peaks during adolescence, we sought to better understand the impact of this BDNF SNP on fear learning during the transition through adolescence in BDNF Val66Met knock-in mice. Previously, we have shown that contextual fear expression is temporarily suppressed in wild-type mice during a distinct period in adolescence, but re-emerges at later, postadolescent ages. Until recently, it was unclear whether BDNF-TrkB signaling is involved in the modulation of hippocampal-dependent contextual fear learning and memory during this adolescent period. Here we show that in BDNF Val66Met mice, the presence of the Met allele does not alter contextual fear expression during adolescence, but when previously conditioned BDNFMet/Met mice are tested in adulthood, they fail to display the delayed expression of contextual fear compared to wild-type BDNFVal/Val controls, indicating that the Met allele may permanently alter hippocampal function, leading to persistent functioning that is indistinguishable from the adolescent state. Conversely, truncated TrkB receptor (TrkB.T1)-deficient (TrkB.T1(-/-)) mice, a genetic mouse model with increased BDNF-TrkB signaling through full-length TrkB receptors, exhibit an accelerated expression of contextual fear during adolescence compared to wild-type controls. Our results point to a critical function for BDNF-TrkB signaling in fear regulation in vivo, particularly during a potentially sensitive period in adolescence. (C) 2014 S.

Following a differential fear-conditioning task, participants in the first two groups underwent the discrimination training or placebo task. An assessment task was then administered. Finally, all participants completed a fear generalization test, consisting of 11 morphs ranging in perceptual similarity from the threat cue to the safety cue. Physiological and self-report measures were collected. Fear-conditioning was achieved in both physiological and self-report measures. Further, in the assessment task, the training group showed better perceptual discrimination than did the placebo group. Last, the training group exhibited less overgeneralization of affective stimuli as indicated by a physiological measure than did the two control conditions.

In the clinic, however, spreading of fear and avoidance is observed beyond movements/activities that were associated with pain during the original pain episode. One mechanism accounting for this spreading of fear is stimulus generalization. In a voluntary movement-conditioning paradigm, healthy participants received predictable pain (ie, one movement predicts pain, another does not) in one context, and unpredictable pain in another context. The former procedure is known to induce cued pain-related fear to the painful movement, whereas the latter procedure generates contextual pain-related fear. In both experimental pain contexts, we subsequently tested fear generalization to novel movements (having either proprioceptive features in common with the original painful movement or nonpainful movement). Results indicated that in the predictable pain context, pain-related fear spreads selectively to novel movements proprioceptively related to the original painful movement, and not to those resembling the original nonpainful movement. In the unpredictable context, nondifferential fear generalization was observed, suggesting persistent contextual pain-related fear and poor safety learning. These data illustrate that spreading of pain-related fear is fostered by previously acquired movement-pain contingencies. Based on recent advances in anxiety research, we proposed an innovative approach conceptualizing predictable pain as a laboratory model for fear of movement in regional musculoskeletal pain, and unpredictable pain generating contextual pain-related fear as a prototype of widespread musculoskeletal pain. Consequently, fear generalization might play an important role in spreading of pain-related fear and avoidance behavior in regional and widespread musculoskeletal pain.

METHODS: To facilitate development of a road map for this needed paradigm change in carcinogenicity testing, a workshop titled Genomics in Cancer Risk Assessment brought together toxicologists from academia and industry and government regulators and risk assessors from the United States and the European Union. Participants discussed the state-of-the-art in developing alternative testing strategies for carcinogenicity, with emphasis on potential contributions from omics technologies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The goal of human risk assessment is to decide whether a given exposure to an agent is acceptable to human health and to provide risk management measures based on evaluating and predicting the effects of exposures on human health. Although exciting progress is being made using genomics approaches, a new paradigm that uses these methods and human material when possible would provide mechanistic insights that may inform new predictive approaches (e. g., in vitro assays) and facilitate the development of genomics-derived biomarkers. Regulators appear to be willing to accept such approaches where use is clearly defined, evidence is strong, and approaches are qualified for regulatory use.","[Paules, Richard S.] NIEHS, Environm Stress & Canc Grp, Lab Toxicol & Pharmacol, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Aubrecht, Jiri] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Corvi, Raffaella] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Inst Hlth & Consumer Protect, European Ctr Validat Alternat Methods, In Vitro Methods Unit, Ispra, Italy; [Garthoff, Bernward] BIO NRW Cluster Biotechnol N Rhine Westphalia, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Kleinjans, Jos C.] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",,"Paules, RS (corresponding author), NIEHS, Environm Stress & Canc Grp, Lab Toxicol & Pharmacol, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 111 TW Alexander Dr,Room D-266B,Box 12233,Mail Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",paules@niehs.nih.gov,"Kleinjans, Jos C.S./E-7241-2015","Paules, Richard S/0000-0001-9106-7486",Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [ZIAES023026] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,42,23,23,0,6,US DEPT HEALTH HUMAN SCIENCES PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE,RES TRIANGLE PK,"NATL INST HEALTH, NATL INST ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES, PO BOX 12233, RES TRIANGLE PK, NC 27709-2233 USA",0091-6765,1552-9924,,ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP,Environ.

These disorders are characterized by deficits in fear extinction and dysfunction in underlying neural circuitry. Given the strong and pervasive link between childhood trauma and the development of psychopathology, fear extinction may be a key mechanism. The present study tests the impact of childhood trauma exposure on fear extinction and underlying neural circuitry. Children (N = 44, 45 % trauma-exposed; 6-11 yrs) completed a novel two-day virtual reality fear extinction experiment. On day one, participants underwent fear conditioning and extinction. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a test of extinction recall during fMRI. Conditioned fear was measured throughout the experiment using skin conductance and fear-related behavior, and activation in fear-related brain regions was estimated during recall. There were no group differences in conditioned fear during fear conditioning or extinction learning. During extinction recall, however, trauma-exposed children kept more distance from both the previously extinguished and the safety cue, suggesting poor differentiation between threat and safety cues. Trauma-exposed youth also failed to approach the previously extinguished cue over the course of extinction recall. The effects on fear-related behavior during extinction recall were accompanied by higher activation to the previously extinguished cue in fear-relevant brain regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, in trauma-exposed relative to control children. Alterations in fear-related brain regions and fear-related behavior may be a core mechanism through which childhood trauma confers heightened vulnerability to psychopathology.","[Marusak, Hilary A.; Hehr, Aneesh; Bhogal, Amanpreet; Rabinak, Christine A.] Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Detroit, MI USA; [Marusak, Hilary A.; Rabinak, Christine A.] Wayne State Univ, Merrill Palmer Skillman Inst Child & Family Dev, Detroit, MI USA; [Peters, Craig; Iadipaolo, Allesandra; Rabinak, Christine A.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Pharm Practice, Eugene Applebaum Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Detroit, MI USA; [Rabinak, Christine A.] Wayne State Univ, Eugene Applebaum Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Detroit, MI USA; [Rabinak, Christine A.] Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Translat Neurosci Program, Detroit, MI USA",,"Marusak, HA (corresponding author), 3901 Chrysler Serv Dr,Suite 2B, Detroit, MI 48201 USA.",hmarusak@med.wayne.edu,"Rabinak, Christine/M-9990-2017","Rabinak, Christine/0000-0001-9810-4024","Wayne State University Department of Pharmacy Practice; American Cancer SocietyAmerican Cancer Society [14-238-04-IRG]; NIH National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K01 MH119241, R61 MH111935]","The authors would like to thank Shelley Paulisin, Sajah Fakhoury, Limi Sharif, Xhenis Brahimi, Farah Sheikh, Suzanne Brown, Ph.D., Laura M.

Individuals can also acquire fear from a social context, such as through observing the fear expression of a conspecific. In the current study, we examined the influence of kinship/familiarity on social transmission of fear in female rats. Rats were housed in triads with either sisters or non-related females. One rat from each cage was fear conditioned to a tone CS+ shock US. On day two, the conditioned rat was returned to the chamber accompanied by one of her cage mates. Both rats were allowed to behave freely, while the tone was played in the absence of the foot-shock. The previously untrained rat is referred to as the fear-conditioned by-proxy (FCbP) animal, as she would freeze based on observations of her cage-mate's response rather than due to direct personal experience with the foot-shock. The third rat served as a cage-mate control. The third day, long-term memory tests to the CS were performed. Consistent with our previous application of this paradigm in male rats (Bruchey et al. in Behav Brain Res 214(1):80-84, 2010), our results revealed that social interactions between the fear conditioned and FCbP rats on day two contribute to freezing displayed by the FCbP rats on day three. In this experiment, prosocial behavior occurring at the termination of the cue on day two was significantly greater between sisters than their non-sister counterparts, and this behavior resulted in increased freezing on day three. Our results suggest that familiarity and/or kinship influences the social transmission of fear in female rats.","[Jones, Carolyn E.; Monfils, Marie-H] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Riha, Penny D.; Gore, Andrea C.] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Pharm, Div Pharmacol & Toxicol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Monfils, Marie-H] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Monfils, MH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Ctr Learning & Memory, 108 E Dean Keeton,A8000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",marie.monfils@utexas.edu,,"Monfils, Marie-H./0000-0001-8971-6651"," [1R21MH086805];  [1R01MH091147]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH091147, R21MH086805] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This study was supported by 1R21MH086805 and 1R01MH091147 to MHM.,,35,46,46,2,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-9448,1435-9456,,ANIM COGN,Anim.

It is a core process in the choice of specific defenses, such as flight, freezing, defensive threat and defensive attack, that counter the threat and minimize the danger it poses. This highly adaptive process takes into account important characteristics, such as type and location (including distance from the subject) of the threat, as well as those (e.g. presence of an escape route or hiding place) of the situation, combining them to predict which specific defense is optimal with that particular combination of threat and situation. Risk assessment is particularly associated with ambiguity either of the threat stimulus or of the outcome of available defensive behaviors. It is also crucial in determining that threat is no longer present, permitting a return to normal, nondefensive behavior. Although risk assessment has been described in detail in rodents, it is also a feature of human defensive behavior, particularly in association with ambiguity. Rumination may be a specifically human form of risk assessment, more often expressed by women, and highly associated with anxiety. Risk assessment behaviors respond to drugs effective against generalized anxiety disorder; however, flight, a dominant specific defense in many common situations, shows a pharmacological response profile closer to that of panic disorder. Risk assessment and flight also appear to show some consistent differences in terms of brain regional activation patterns, suggesting a potential biological differentiation of anxiety and fear/panic systems. An especially intriguing possibility is that mirror neurons may respond to some of the same types of situational differences that are analyzed during risk assessment, suggesting an additional functional role for these neurons.

The present study examined some of the factors that may influence the commercial laying hen's fear of humans. In Part 1 of this study extensive behavioural data from a previous study at commercial farms were re-examined to study the effects of tier level on the behavioural responses of commercial laying hens to humans. Significant effects of tier level were found in multi-tier (three- or four-tier) battery-cage systems on the behavioural responses of commercial birds to humans. On the basis of the withdrawal responses of birds to an approaching experimenter, fear of humans may decline from moderate levels among birds housed in Tier 1 (bottom) to Tier 3, in both systems and then sharply increase from Tier 3 to Tier 4, in the four-tier system, reaching the highest level recorded. For example, birds in Tier 3 (top tier) in the three-tier system were more frequently (P<0.01) observed in the front 20 cm of the cage as the experimenter approached than birds in Tier 1 (bottom tier), however in the four-tier system birds in Tier 4 (top) were observed less frequently (P<0.05) in this area as the experimenter approached than birds in Tier 1. In a series of paired comparisons in Part 2 of the study, a number of aspects of human approach were classified within the paired comparisons as more or less threatening to birds on the basis of the birds' withdrawal responses. The most striking effect was the marked withdrawal (P<0.01) of birds when the experimenter stood 30 rather than 60 cm from the cage. Furthermore, there was more withdrawal (P<0.05) when the experimenter positioned himself so that his eyes were 30 cm below rather than 30 cm above the height of the bird's eyes. A greater (P<0.05) number of bouts of crouching or escape attempts were observed when the experimenter placed his hands rather than his face 30 cm in front of the cage. The determination of stimulus-response relationships in Part 2 of this study, will be useful in identifying those features of human-approach behaviour which may regulate the bird's fear of humans. With this type of information, it may be possible to reduce the commercial bird's fear of humans in order to improve bird productivity and welfare by manipulating these human factors.","INST ANIM PHYSIOL & GENET RES,ROSLIN,SCOTLAND",,"HEMSWORTH, PH (corresponding author), VICTORIAN INST ANIM SCI,475 MICKLEHAM RD,ATTWOOD,VIC 3049,AUSTRALIA.",,,"Hemsworth, Paul/0000-0002-0211-0751",,,,39,25,26,1,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1591,,,APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI,Appl.

This study linked probabilistic risk assessment to the interactive hazard index (HIINT) approach to assess the human mixture risk posed by the dietary intake of iAs, Cd, Pb, and MeHg from seafood for different age populations, and joint toxic actions and toxic interactions among metals were also considered in the assessment. We found that, in combination, an iAs-Cd-Pb-MeHg mixture synergistically causes neurological toxicity. Furthermore, an iAs-Cd-Pb mixture antagonistically causes renal and hematological effects and additively causes cardiovascular effect. Our results demonstrated that if toxic interactions are not considered, the health risk may be overestimated or underestimated. The 50th percentile HIINT estimates in all age populations for neurological, renal, cardiovascular, and hematological effects were lower than 1; however, the 97.5th percentile HIINT estimates might exceed 1. In particular, toddlers and preschoolers had the highest neurological risk, with 0.16 and 0.19 probabilities, respectively, of neurological HIINT exceeding 1. Saltwater fish consumption was the principal contributor to the health risk. We suggest that regular monitoring of metal levels in seafood, more precise dietary surveys, further toxicological data, and risk-benefit analysis of seafood consumption are warranted to improve the accuracy of human mixture risk assessment and determine optimal consumption.","[Lin, Yi-Jun; Lin, Pinpin] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Food Safety & Hlth Risk Assessment, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Pinpin] Natl Hlth Res Inst, Natl Inst Environm Hlth Sci, Zhunan Township, Miaoli County, Taiwan",,"Lin, PP (corresponding author), Natl Hlth Res Inst, Natl Inst Environm Hlth Sci, Zhunan Township, Miaoli County, Taiwan.",pplin@nhri.org.tw,"Lin, PinPin/A-2006-2019; Lin, Pinpin/B-2668-2010","Lin, PinPin/0000-0001-5459-907X; Lin, Pinpin/0000-0001-5459-907X",National Health Research Institutes of TaiwanNational Health Research Institutes - Taiwan [NHRI-EM-107-SP-01],We thank the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan and the Taiwan National Food Consumption Database for the valuable data set of age-specific food ingestion rates.

Activation during conditioning training was compared to habituation and extinction sessions. Conditioned stimuli (CS) were visually presented geometric figures, and unconditioned stimuli (US) were aversive white-noise bursts. The CS+ was paired with the US on 50% of presentations and the CS- was never paired. The precise temporal resolution of MEG allowed us to address the issue of whether the amygdala responds to the onset or offset of the CS+, and/or the expectation of the initiation or offset of the an omitted auditory US. Fear conditioning elicited differential amygdala activation for the unpaired CS+ compared to the CS-, extinction and habituation. This was especially robust in the right hemisphere at CS onset. The strongest peaks of amygdala activity occurred at an average of 270 ms in the right and 306 ms in the left hemisphere following unpaired CS+ onset, and following offset at 21 ms in the left and 161 ms in the right (corresponding to an interval of 108 ms and 248 ms after the anticipated onset of the US, respectively). However, the earliest peaks in this epoch preceded US onset in most subjects. Thus, the activity dynamics suggest that the amygdala both differentially responds to stimuli and anticipates the arrival of stimuli based on prior learning of contingencies. The amygdala also shows stimulus omission-related activation that could potentially provide feedback about experienced stimulus contingencies to modify future responding during learning and extinction.

One of the most common and effective UCSs is an electric shock, which is inappropriate for certain populations (e.g., children). To address this need, a novel fear learning paradigm was recently developed that uses a fearful female face and scream as the UCS. The present study directly compared the efficacy of the screaming female UCS and a traditional shock UCS in two fear learning paradigms. Thirty-six young adults completed two fear learning tasks and a measure of trait anxiety; fear learning was indexed with fear-potentiated startle (FPS) and self-reported fear ratings. Results indicated comparable FPS across the two tasks. However, larger overall startle responses were exhibited in the shock task, and participants rated the shock UCS and overall task as more aversive than the screaming female. In addition, trait anxiety was only related to FPS in the fear learning task that employed a shock as the UCS. Taken together, results indicate that, although both UCS paradigms can be used for fear conditioning (i.e., to produce differences between CS+ and CS-). the shock UCS paradigm is more aversive and potentially more sensitive to individual differences in anxiety.

The current study utilized a previously validated fear acquisition and extinction paradigm in a sample of 75 undergraduate women who were exposed to a campus mass shooting that occurred in 2008. We used a protocol in which conditioned fear was first acquired through the presentation of one colored shape (reinforced conditioned stimulus, CS+) that was paired with an aversive airblast to the larynx (unconditioned stimulus, US) and a different colored shape that was not paired with the airblast (non-reinforced conditioned stimulus, CS-). Fear was extinguished 10 min later through repeated presentations of the CSs without reinforcement. Number of clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) immediately following the mass shooting were positively associated with fear-potentiated startle (FPS) to the CS+ and CS- during late periods of acquisition. During early periods of fear extinction, PTSS was positively associated with FPS to the CS+. Results from the current study suggest that PTSS is related to altered fear inhibition and extinction during an FPS paradigm. In line with similar research, women with greater PTSS demonstrated a greater fear load, suggesting that these women experienced elevated fear to the CS+ during extinction after conditioned fear was acquired","[Orcutt, Holly K.; Hannan, Susan M.; Seligowski, AntoniaV.; McCanne, Thomas] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Psychol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Jovanovic, Tanja; Norrholm, Seth D.; Ressler, Kerry J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.] Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Trauma Recovery Program, Decatur, GA USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA USA",,"Orcutt, HK (corresponding author), Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Psychol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",horcutt@niu.edu,"Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022","Orcutt, Holly/0000-0002-0197-0784","Joyce Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1R15HD049907-01A1, 5R21MH085436-02, 1R15MH099521-01]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH &HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R15HD049907] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH085436, R15MH099521] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was funded by grants from the Joyce Foundation and the National Institutes of Health (1R15HD049907-01A1, 5R21MH085436-02, 1R15MH099521-01).",,31,9,9,0,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Participants were 1,292 mother-infant pairs prospectively assessed at three times when infants were 6, 15, and 24 months old. Infant high-intensity fear and fear regulation (avoidance, orienting to mother, attention regulation, and self-soothing) were observed during the Mask Task at each of these time points. Likewise, mothers reported their depressive symptoms, and their sensitivity was observed in a separate mother-child interaction task at each time point. Conditional multilevel growth models revealed that highly avoidant infants exhibited less initial high-intensity fear, but faster growth in high-intensity fear over time. Furthermore, highly avoidant infants exhibited more concurrent high-intensity fear when their mothers demonstrated low sensitivity. Unexpectedly, when their mothers were highly depressed, infants who used more attention regulation demonstrated more rapid growth of high-intensity fear over time. Finally, when their mothers were not depressed, infants exhibiting more high-intensity fear oriented more to their mothers concurrently. When their mothers reported high depressive symptoms over time, infants with more high-intensity fear initially oriented less to their mothers but more rapidly increased orienting to their mothers over time. Findings reveal the interplay between infant and maternal factors over time in development of infant high-intensity fear. In particular, maternal sensitivity protected highly fearful infants by rapidly reducing fear reactivity despite infant avoidance. In contrast, high maternal depressive symptoms introduced both immediate and enduring risks for infant fear development. Clinical implications are discussed.","[Wu, Qiong; Gazelle, Heidi] Florida State Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Sci, Dept Human Dev & Family Sci, Sandels 225,120 Convocat Way, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",,"Wu, Q (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Sci, Dept Human Dev & Family Sci, Sandels 225,120 Convocat Way, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",qwu3@fsu.edu,"Gazelle, Heidi/I-2890-2019","Gazelle, Heidi/0000-0002-8071-1691; Wu, Qiong/0000-0002-4812-1181",,,,50,1,1,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2730-7166,2730-7174,,RES CHILD ADOLES PSY,Res.

Managing aviation requires high awareness on human factor risk which includes organizational behavior-related topics. The greatest risk to an enterprise's ability to achieve its strategic goals and objectives is the human factor. Both organizational behavior and corporate culture behavior with social psychology are the most vital aspects of management and strategy in terms of human resources. Related risks, including organizational behavior and culture, have the potential to directly impact on both business performance and corporate sustainability. Therefore, in this paper, the most prominent risks were determined in accordance with social psychology, and after identification of human factor-based risks, these have prioritized and prepared risk mapping with fresh approach. For this reason, this study aims to develop risk mapping model for human factors that takes into account interrelations among risk factors three dimensional based new approach. This approach includes both identification of human factor based risks, prioritization them and setting risk mapping according to corporate based qualifications via tailoring risk list. Developed risk map in this paper will help to manage corporate risks to achieve improved performance and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This new organizational behavior- and culture-focused risk mapping model developed in this study has the potential to make significant contribution to the management of the human factor for modern management and strategy. In enterprise risk management system, risk mapping is both strong and effective strategic methodology to manage ergonomics issue with strategic approach. Human factor is both determinative and also strategic element to both continuity and performance of business operations with safely and sound. In view of management and strategy, vitally, the human factor determines the outcome in both every business and every decision-making. Findings It is assumed that, if managers manage human risk you may get advantages to achieving corporate strategies in timely manner. Aviation is sensitive sector for its ingredients: airports, airlines, air traffic management, aircraft maintenance, pilotage and ground handling. Aim of this paper is to present risk management approach to optimize human performance while minimizing both failures and errors by aircraft maintenance technician (AMT). This model may apply all human factors in other departments of aviation such as pilots and traffic controllers. AMT is key component of aircraft maintenance. Thus, errors made by AMTs will cause aircraft accidents or incidents or near miss incidents. In this study, new taxonomy model for human risk factors in aircraft maintenance organizations has been designed, and also new qualitative risk assessment as three dimensions is carried out by considering the factors affecting the AMT's error obtained from extensive literature review and expert opinions in the field of aviation. Human error risks are first categorized into two main groups and sub three groups and then prioritized using the risk matrix via triple dimension as probability, severity and interrelations ratio between risks. Practical implications Risk mapping is established to decide which risk management option they will apply for managers when they will look at this map. Managers may use risk map to both identify their managerial priorities and share sources to managing risks, and make decisions on risk handling options. This new model may be a useful new tool to manage ergonomic human factor-based risks in developing strategy in aviation business management. In addition, this paper will contribute to department of management and strategy and related literature. Originality/value This study has originality via new modeling of risk matrix. In this study, dimension of risk analysis has been improved as three dimensions. This study has new approach and new assessment of risk with likelihood (probability), impact (severity) and interrelations ratio. This new model may be a useful new tool to both assess and prioritize mapping of ergonomic-based risks in business management. In addition, this research will contribute to aviation management and strategy literature and also enterprise risk management literature.","[Yilmaz, Ayse Kucuk] Anadolu Univ, Fac Aeronaut & Astronaut, Eskisehir, Turkey",,"Yilmaz, AK (corresponding author), Anadolu Univ, Fac Aeronaut & Astronaut, Eskisehir, Turkey.",akucukyilmaz@anadolu.edu.tr,"YILMAZ, AYSE KUCUK/E-3693-2015; Yilmaz, Ayse Kucuk/F-1270-2019","Yilmaz, Ayse Kucuk/0000-0001-5240-1023",,,,35,3,3,9,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-8842,1758-4213,,AIRCR ENG AEROSP TEC,Aircr.

Amygdala lesions impair the ability to seek out and make use of the eye region of faces, resulting in impaired fear perception. Other studies in rats and humans revive earlier proposals that the amygdala is important not only for fear perception as such, but also for detecting saliency and biological relevance. Debates about some features of this processing now suggest that while the amygdala can process fearful facial expressions in the absence of conscious perception, and while there is some degree of preattentive processing, this depends on the context and is not necessarily more rapid than cortical processing routes. A large current research effort extends the amygdala's putative role to a number of psychiatric illnesses.","CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,"Adolphs, R (corresponding author), CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",radolphs@hss.caltech.edu,,,"NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Simons Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH080721, R01MH067681] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This paper was supported by grants from NIMH, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Simons Foundation.",,72,309,315,1,70,CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0959-4388,1873-6882,,CURR OPIN NEUROBIOL,Curr.

In particular, stress that is administered immediately before learning enhances long-term memory, while stress that is temporally separated from learning impairs long-term memory. We have extended these findings by examining the impact of immediate, pre-learning stress on an amygdala-dependent fear conditioning task. One hundred and forty-one healthy participants underwent a stress (socially evaluated cold pressor test) or control manipulation immediately before completing differential fear conditioning in a fear-potentiated startle paradigm. Participants then completed extinction and extinction memory testing sessions 24 and 48 h later, respectively. Stress administered immediately before acquisition increased baseline startle responses and enhanced fear learning, as evidenced by greater fear-potentiated startle to the CS +. Although no group differences were observed during extinction training on Day 2, stressed participants exhibited evidence of impaired extinction processes on Day 3, an effect that was driven by group differences in acquisition. Importantly, stressed participants' cortisol responses to the stressor on Day 1 were positively associated with CS discrimination on Days 2 and 3. These findings suggest that stress immediately before fear conditioning strengthens fear memory formation and produces a more enduring fear memory, perhaps via corticosteroid activity. Such a paradigm could be useful for understanding factors that influence traumatic memory formation.","[Riggenbach, Mackenzie R.; Weiser, Jordan N.; Mosley, Brianne E.; Hipskind, Jennifer J.; Wireman, Leighton E.; Hess, Kelsey L.; Duffy, Tessa J.; Handel, Julie K.; Kaschalk, MacKenzie G.; Reneau, Kassidy E.; Zoladz, Phillip R.] Ohio Northern Univ, Dept Psychol Sociol & Criminal Justice, 525 S Main St,Hill 013, Ada, OH 45810 USA; [Rorabaugh, Boyd R.] Ohio Northern Univ, Raabe Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut & Biomed Sci, Ada, OH 45810 USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.] Atlanta VA Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line, Decatur, GA USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja] Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Zoladz, PR (corresponding author), Ohio Northern Univ, Dept Psychol Sociol & Criminal Justice, 525 S Main St,Hill 013, Ada, OH 45810 USA.",p-zoladz@onu.edu,"Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022","Riggenbach, Mackenzie R./0000-0003-1114-0079; Zoladz, Phillip/0000-0001-9967-9145",National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R15MH104836],"The research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under award number R15MH104836.

While fear extinction is generally thought to be a form of new learning, several lines of evidence suggest that neuronal changes associated with fear conditioning could be reversed after fear extinction. To better understand how fear conditioning and extinction modify synaptic circuits, we examined changes of postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse auditory cortex over time using transcranial two-photon microscopy. We found that auditory-cued fear conditioning induced the formation of new dendritic spines within 2 days. The survived new spines induced by fear conditioning with one auditory cue were clustered within dendritic branch segments and spatially segregated from new spines induced by fear conditioning with a different auditory cue. Importantly, fear extinction preferentially caused the elimination of newly formed spines induced by fear conditioning in an auditory cue-specific manner. Furthermore, after fear extinction, fear reconditioning induced reformation of new dendritic spines in close proximity to the sites of new spine formation induced by previous fear conditioning. These results show that fear conditioning, extinction, and reconditioning induce cue- and location specific dendritic spine remodeling in the auditory cortex. They also suggest that changes of synaptic connections induced by fear conditioning are reversed after fear extinction.","[Lai, Cora Sau Wan] Univ Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Fac Med, Sch Biomed Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lai, Cora Sau Wan] Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Brain & Cognit Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Adler, Avital; Gan, Wen-Biao] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci & Physiol, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA",,"Lai, CSW (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Fac Med, Sch Biomed Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Lai, CSW (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Brain & Cognit Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Gan, WB (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci & Physiol, Skirball Inst, New York, NY 10016 USA.",cora.swlai@hku.hk; Wenbiao.Gan@med.nyu.edu,", 0000-0002-5721-4259/K-3037-2019",", 0000-0002-5721-4259/0000-0002-5721-4259",Research Grants Council (RGC)/Early Career Scheme [27103715]; RGC/General Research Fund [17128816]; Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF) [03143096]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31571031];  [5R01NS047325]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R01NS047325] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by 5R01NS047325 (to W.-B.G.), Research Grants Council (RGC)/Early Career Scheme (27103715), RGC/General Research Fund (17128816), Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF) (03143096), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (31571031) (to C.S.W.L.).",,46,24,25,6,19,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

A 40-year time course of dioxin accumulation via food ingestion was simulated using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. In richly perfused tissue, the concentration estimated by the PBPK model showed better agreement with measured concentrations than that calculated by the one-compartment model. Fetal dioxin concentration was simulated based on the assumption that the fetal concentration was almost equal to the concentration in the mother's richly perfused tissue. To assess the reproductive risk, the estimated concentration in human fetus was compared with that in rat fetus in which reproductive function showed signs of alteration by 2,3,7,8-TCDD in previous reports [Toxicol.

The present daily intake of 2,3,7,8-TCDD is approximately 1/50 of the amount that leads to possible reproductive toxicity in the next generation. However, when 29 kinds of dioxin congeners are considered, the present level is 115 of the hazardous levels. For species extrapolation of dioxin risk, further study on tissue concentration versus toxicity is required. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we summarise the recent work in this area, focusing on the unique behavioural and neural characteristics of fear extinction in adolescent rodents, and humans where relevant. A prominent hypothesis posits that anxiety disorders peak during late childhood/adolescence due to the non-linear maturation of the fear inhibition neural circuitry. We discuss evidence that impaired extinction retention in adolescence is due to subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala mediating fear inhibition being underactive while other subregions that mediate fear expression are overactive. We also review work on various interventions and surprising circumstances which enhance fear extinction in adolescence. This latter work revealed that the neural correlates of extinction in adolescence are different to that in younger and older animals even when extinction retention is not impaired. This growing body of work highlights that adolescence is a unique period of development for fear inhibition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that early adversity impairs the use of learning signals -negative, aversive prediction errors to reduce fear in uncertainty. To test this hypothesis, we gave adolescent rats a battery of adverse experiences then assessed adult performance in probabilistic Pavlovian fear conditioning and fear extinction. Rats were confronted with three cues associated with different probabilities of foot shock: one cue never predicted shock, another cue predicted shock with uncertainty, and a final cue always predicted shock. Control rats initially acquired fear to all cues, but rapidly reduced fear to the non-predictive and uncertain cues. Early adversity rats were slower to reduce fear to the non-predictive cue and never fully reduced fear to the uncertain cue. In extinction, all cues were presented in the absence of shock. Fear to the uncertain cue in discrimination, but not early adversity itself, predicted the reduction of fear in extinction. These results demonstrate early adversity impairs the use of negative aversive prediction errors to reduce fear, especially in situations of uncertainty.","[Wright, Kristina M.; DiLeo, Alyssa; McDannald, Michael A.] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, McDannald Lab, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",,"McDannald, MA (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, 140 Commonwealth Ave,514 McGuinn Hall, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",michael.mcdannald@bc.edu,,"DiLeo, Alyssa/0000-0002-4626-4437; Wright, Kristina/0000-0003-1446-3009",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DA034010]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R00DA034010] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant DA034010 (MM).,,46,18,18,0,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Most of what is known about the neurobiology of extinction is based on standard delay fear conditioning, in which awareness is not required for learning. Little is known about how complex, explicit associations extinguish, however. Trace conditioning is considered to be a rodent model of explicit fear because it relies on both the cortex and hippocampus and requires explicit contingency awareness in humans. Here, we explore the neural circuit supporting trace fear extinction in order to better understand how complex memories extinguish. We first show that the amygdala is selectively involved in delay fear extinction; blocking intra-amygdala glutamate receptors disrupted delay, but not trace extinction. Further, ERK phosphorylation was increased in the amygdala after delay, but not trace extinction. We then identify the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) as a key structure supporting trace extinction. ERK phosphorylation was selectively increased in the RSC following trace extinction and blocking intra-RSC NMDA receptors impaired trace, but not delay extinction. These findings indicate that delay and trace extinction require different neural circuits; delay extinction requires plasticity in the amygdala whereas trace extinction requires the RSC. Anxiety disorders linked to explicit memory may therefore depend on cortical processes that have not been traditionally targeted by extinction studies based on delay fear. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Fear is often not restricted to movements (conditioned stimulus [CS+]) originally associated with pain (unconditioned stimulus), but expands to similar movements (generalization stimuli [GSs]). This spreading of fear becomes dysfunctional when overgeneralization to safe stimuli occurs. More importantly, persistence of pain-related fear to GSs despite corrective feedback might even be more debilitating and maintain long-term chronic pain disability. Yet, research on this topic is lacking. Using a voluntary joystick movement paradigm, we examined (extinction of) pain-related fear generalization in fibromyalgia patients (FM) and healthy control participants (HC). During acquisition, one movement (CS+) predicted pain; another did not (CS-). We tested (extinction of) fear generalization to 5 GSs varying in similarity with the CS+ and CS-. Results revealed flatter pain expectancy generalization gradients in FM than in HC due to elevated responses to GSs more similar to the CS-; the fear generalization gradients did not differ. Although pain-related fear and expectancy to the GSs decreased during extinction, responses to the GSs remained higher for FM than HC, suggesting that extinction of generalization is impaired in chronic pain patients. Persistence of excessive protective responses may contribute to maintaining long-term chronic pain disability. Perspective: Pain-related fear and expectancy to movements-varying in similarity with the original painful and nonpainful movement-decrease during extinction in HC and FM. Yet, conditioned responses remain elevated in patients despite corrective feedback, indicating impaired extinction of generalization. Persistent excessive protective responses may contribute to preserving pain disability. (C) 2016 by the American Pain Society","[Meulders, Ann; Stouten, Iris; Vlaeyen, Johan W.

We compared activation of fear and extinction networks between insomnia disorder (ID) without comorbidity and good sleepers (GS). Methods: Twenty-three ID participants age-and sex-matched to 23 GS participants completed 14 days of actigraphy and diaries, three nights of ambulatory polysomnography and a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Fear conditioning and extinction learning occurred on the first day, followed 24 hours later by extinction recall. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal and skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded. Nineteen participants per group produced usable fMRI data. Beta weights from areas where activation differed between groups were regressed against sleep and psychophysiological measures. SCR was compared between groups at various stages of the paradigm. Results: During fear conditioning, both ID (N = 19) and GS (N = 19) activated fear-related structures. Across extinction learning, ID (N = 19) demonstrated little change, whereas GS (N = 16) activated both fear and extinction-related areas, including the hippocampus, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), and ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) cortices. During extinction recall, while GS (N = 17) demonstrated limited activation, ID (N = 16) activated regions similar to those previously activated in GS (vmPFC, dACC, insula). Sleep quality was predictive of activations seen at various stages of the paradigm. SCR data suggested ID were more physiologically reactive than GS. Conclusions: Across extinction learning, GS but not ID activated both fear and extinction-related networks. At extinction recall, ID engaged similar regions whereas GS no longer did so. Individuals with ID may show a delayed acquisition of fear extinction memories.","[Seo, Jeehye; Moore, Kylie N.; Gazecki, Samuel; Bottary, Ryan M.; Pace-Schott, Edward F.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA USA; [Seo, Jeehye; Pace-Schott, Edward F.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, CNY 149 13th St,Room 2605, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Seo, Jeehye; Moore, Kylie N.; Gazecki, Samuel; Bottary, Ryan M.; Pace-Schott, Edward F.] Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA USA; [Milad, Mohammed R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Song, Huijin] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Inst Biomed Engn Res, Daegu, South Korea",,"Pace-Schott, EF (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp East, CNY 149 13th St,Room 2605, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",epace-schott@mgh.harvard.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH101567, MH 109638]; 2016 Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior Interfaculty Initiative; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH109638] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This project was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants MH101567 and MH 109638 to E.F.P-S. and the 2016 Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior Interfaculty Initiative (E.F.P-S., Co-PI).",,86,18,18,2,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0161-8105,1550-9109,,SLEEP,Sleep,AUG,2018,41,8,,,,,,,zsy095,10.1093/sleep/zsy095,,,18,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,GQ6HW,WOS:000441809500008,29860407,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2022-04-16,

We critically reviewed and assessed all relevant full-text publications based on a variety of data quality attributes. Two categories of data, environmental monitoring and biomonitoring from exposed individuals, were used to estimate human exposure to NP. Environmental monitoring data included the measurement of NP in food, water, air, and dust. From these data and estimates of human intake rates for the sources, exposures were estimated from each source and source-specific Margins of Exposure (MOEs) calculated. However, the nature of the populations studied prevented the calculation of aggregate exposure calculations from these data. Rather, the most reliable estimates of aggregate exposure to NP were those derived from biomonitoring studies in exposed individuals.

The SOS attempts to merge ecological models that define a repertoire of contextually relevant threat induced survival behaviors with contemporary approaches to human affective science. We first propose that the goal of the nervous system is to reduce surprise and optimize actions by (i) predicting the sensory landscape by simulating possible encounters with threat and selecting the appropriate pre-encounter action and (ii) prevention strategies in which the organism manufactures safe environments. When a potential threat is encountered the (iii) threat orienting system is engaged to determine whether the organism ignores the stimulus or switches into a process of (iv) threat assessment, where the organism monitors the stimulus, weighs the threat value, predicts the actions of the threat, searches for safety, and guides behavioral actions crucial to directed escape. When under imminent attack, (v) defensive systems evoke fast reflexive indirect escape behaviors (i.e., fight or flight). This cascade of responses to threat of increasing magnitude are underwritten by an interconnected neural architecture that extends from cortical and hippocampal circuits, to attention, action and threat systems including the amygdala, striatum, and hard wired defensive systems in the midbrain. The SOS also includes a modulatory feature consisting of cognitive appraisal systems that flexibly guide perception, risk and action. Moreover, personal and vicarious threat encounters fine-tune avoidance behaviors via model-based learning, with higher organisms bridging data to reduce face-to-face encounters with predators. Our model attempts to unify the divergent field of human affective science, proposing a highly integrated nervous system that has evolved to increase the organism's chances of survival.","[Mobbs, Dean; Hagan, Cindy C.; Silston, Brian; Prevost, Charlotte] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dalgleish, Tim] MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge, England",,"Mobbs, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, Fear Anxiety & Biosocial Behav Lab, 406 Schermertorn Hall,1190 Amsterdam Ave,MC 5501, New York, NY 10027 USA.",dmobbs@psych.columbia.edu,"Dalgleish, Tim/E-8341-2010","Dalgleish, Tim/0000-0002-7304-2231; Hagan, Cindy/0000-0002-4576-7120; Silston, Brian/0000-0002-3365-0013",Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MC_U105579215] Funding Source: Medline,,,223,146,150,3,60,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-453X,,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

Given the importance of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in mediating both learned and innate fear, we investigated how BLA neurons may respond to high-place exposure in freely behaving male mice. We found that a discrete set of BLA neurons exhibited robust firing increases when the mouse was either exploring or placed on a high place, accompanied by increased heart rate and freezing. Importantly, these high-place fear neurons were only activated under height threats, but not looming, acoustic startle, predatory odor, or mild anxiogenic conditions. Furthermore, after a fear-conditioning procedure, these high-place fear neurons developed conditioned responses to the context, but not the cue, indicating a convergence in processing of dangerous/risky contextual information. Our results provide insights into the neuronal representation of the fear of heights and may have implications for the treatment of excessive fear disorders.","[Liu, Jun; Wang, Dong, V] Drexel Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Coll Med, Philadelphia, PA 19129 USA; [Liu, Jun; Lin, Longnian] East China Normal Univ, NYU ECNU Inst Brain & Cognit Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Minist Educ,Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",,"Wang, DV (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Anat, Coll Med, Philadelphia, PA 19129 USA.; Lin, LN (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, NYU ECNU Inst Brain & Cognit Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Minist Educ,Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",lnlin@brain.ecnu.edu.or; dw657@drexel.edu,,"Wang, Dong/0000-0001-8537-5677",National Institute of Mental Health/National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01-MH-119102]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31661143038],This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health/National Institutes of Health (Grant R01-MH-119102 to D.V.

A region-of-interest analysis demonstrated differential change in BOLD signal in the right but not left amygdala across CS+ versus CS- viewing. The amygdala is engaged by pairing of a light with an air puff.

Counterconditioning and novelty-facilitated extinction have been shown to interfere with fear expression without erasing it. Because of the similarity between the two extinction paradigms, we extended the standard extinction, which merely omitted the expected threat outcomes after exposure to original threat cues. The modified paradigm provided a stimulus (neutral picture or positive picture) to replace the omitted threat outcomes during extinction. Sixty-four healthy volunteers were randomized into three groups for a three-day procedure: fear acquisition (day 1), fear extinction (day 2), and fear recall and generalization test (day 3). Our results showed the modified extinction paradigm failed to prevent fear expression in spontaneous recovery and reinstatement tests. However, novelty-facilitated extinction showed powerful effects in preventing fear generalization. Besides, there was a negative correlation between spontaneous recovery index and emotion regulation scores. We speculated that emotion and prediction error may be important factors influencing fear extinction and affect fear recall and generalization. Overall, this study suggests that novelty-facilitated extinction had a superior effect in preventing fear generalization, providing new perspectives for enhancing the effect of exposure therapy.","[Chen, Yu; Sun, Yan; Meng, Shiqiu; Lu, Lin; Shi, Jie] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, 38 Xue Yuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yu; Lin, Xiao; Shi, Le; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Univ Hosp 6, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Peking Univ Inst Mental Hlth,NHC Key Lab Mental H, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ai, Sizhi] Xinxiang Med Univ, Heart Ctr, Dept Cardiol, Henan Key Lab Neurorestoratol,Affiliated Hosp 1, Weihui, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin; Shi, Jie] Beijing Key Lab Drug Dependence Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin; Shi, Jie] State Key Lab Nat & Biomimet Drugs, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jie] Peking Univ Shenzhen Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Shi, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, 38 Xue Yuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",shijie@bjmu.edu.cn,,"Chen, Yu/0000-0002-4768-9269","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U180220091, U1904159]; Beijing Municipal Science & Technology CommissionBeijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z181100001518005]","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U180220091, U1904159) , and the Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission (Z181100001518005) .

How the stress hormone cortisol affects brain regions involved in fear extinction in humans is unknown. For this reason, we tested 32 men randomly assigned to receive either 30mg hydrocortisone or placebo 45 min before fear extinction. In fear acquisition, a picture of a geometrical figure was either partially paired (conditioned stimulus; CS+) or not paired (CS-) with an electrical stimulation (unconditioned stimulus; UCS). In fear extinction, each CS was presented again, but no UCS occurred. Cortisol increased conditioned skin conductance responses in early and late extinction. In early extinction, higher activation towards the CS- than to the CS+ was found in the amygdala, hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal gyrus. This pattern might be associated with the establishment of a new memory trace. In late extinction, the placebo compared with the cortisol group displayed enhanced CS+/CS- differentiation in the amygdala, medial frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. A change from early deactivation to late activation of the extinction circuit as seen in the placebo group seems to be needed to enhance extinction and to reduce fear. Cortisol appears to interfere with this process thereby impairing extinction of recently acquired conditioned fear.","[Merz, Christian Josef; Wolf, Oliver Tobias] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Merz, Christian Josef; Hermann, Andrea; Stark, Rudolf] Univ Giessen, Bender Inst Neuroimaging, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Hermann, Andrea; Stark, Rudolf] Univ Giessen, Dept Psychotherapy & Syst Neurosci, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",,"Merz, CJ (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",Christian.J.Merz@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,"Merz, Christian J/I-7635-2019","Merz, Christian J/0000-0001-5679-6595; Wolf, Oliver T./0000-0002-9320-2124","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) (part of the DFG Research Unit FOR 1581, Extinction Learning)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WO 733/13-1]","Funding for this study was provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) to O.T.W.

These ambiguous findings may be due to differential actions of ovarian steroids on anxiety versus fear. To investigate such a role, we used the open field test (OFT) and fear-potentiated startle (FPS). We examined these behaviors between cycling female rats in proestrus (high E and rising P) or diestrus (low E and P), as well as between ovariectomized rats treated for 2 weeks with placebo, E, or E plus P (OVX, OVX/E, OVX/EP, respectively). We found no differences in anxiety-like or fear behaviors in OFT or FPS between proestrus and diestrus rats, perhaps due to the opposing effects of E and P. In contrast, we found that the OVX/E rats spent more time in the center of the OFT compared to the OVX and OVX/EP rats with no difference in overall activity level, suggesting that E reduced anxiety and this was opposed by P. With FPS, the OVX/E rats showed increased startle in the first third of the testing session, followed by a rapid decline in startle magnitude in subsequent trials. The addition of P to E treatment counteracted this effect. In conclusion, E may have differential effects on specific components of anxiety and fear; E may decrease anxiety in a naturalistic environment, but intensify both fear learning and extinction processes. P antagonizes these E effects on anxiety and fear. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the surprise effect test, multiparous and primiparous ewes were both significantly less fearful than the nulliparous ewes.

Pet-1 (FEV-1) is an ETS-domain transcription factor essential for differentiation and forebrain targeting of serotonin neurons. Constitutive P knockout (KO) causes major loss of serotonin neurons and forebrain serotonin availability, and behavioral abnormalities. We phenotyped Pet-1 KO mice for fear conditioning and extinction, and on a battery of assays for anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Morphology of Golgi-stained neurons in basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prelimbic cortex was examined. Using human imaging genetics, a common variant (rs860573) in the PET-1 (FEY) gene was tested for effects on threat-related amygdala reactivity and psychopathology in 88 Asian-ancestry subjects. Pet-1 KO mice exhibited increased acquisition and expression of fear, and elevated fear recovery following extinction, relative to wild-type (WT). BLA dendrites of Pet-1 KO mice were significantly longer than in WT. Human PET-1 variation associated with differences in amygdala threat processing and psychopathology. This novel evidence for the role of Pet-1 in fear processing and dendritic organization of amygdala neurons and in human amygdala threat processing extends a growing literature demonstrating the influence of genetic variation in the serotonin system on emotional regulation via effects on structure and function of underlying corticolimbic circuitry.

Women, middle-aged and older adults were more likely to fear dogs than men and younger adults, while older people were more likely than younger ones to fear dog attacks. Reported encounters with canine aggression, particularly threatening behavior, were relatively common, but having been attacked by a dog was less strongly related to fear of dogs than having been threatened by a dog. Logistic regression analyses revealed that being female, having been threatened by a dog, and being older were strong predictors of dog-related fear while being older and obtaining higher scores on a measure of trait anxiety predicted fear of dog attacks.

There are growing concerns that performance-based fire engineering designs underestimate safety risk levels in high-rise residential buildings. Existing fire risk models account for failures of technical systems but ignore human and organizational errors (HOEs) and the complex interactions among these variables. Probabilistic models in other applications, such as offshore platforms and nuclear plants, demonstrate the importance of HOE inclusion in risk models and the resulting impacts on overall risk. This paper proposes a comprehensive technical-human-organizational risk (T-H-O-Risk) methodology to enhance the PRA approach by quantifying human and organizational risks in a probabilistic model using Bayesian Network (BN) analysis of HOEs and System Dynamics (SD) modelling for dynamic characterization of risk variations over time. While risk modelling itself is not novel, the current research develops unique and specific enhancements to existing risk approaches by integrating HOE risks with technical risks in a comprehensive dynamic and probabilistic model for high-rise residential buildings. Three case studies are conducted to demonstrate the application of this comprehensive approach to the designs of various high-rise residential buildings ranging from 18 to 24 storeys. Societal risks are represented in F-N curves. Results show that in general, fire safety designs that do not consider HOEs underestimate overall risks generally by similar to 20%-and can reach up to 42% in an extreme case. Furthermore, risks over time due to HOEs vary by as much as 30% over a 10-year period. A sensitivity analysis indicates that deficient training, poor safety culture and ineffective emergency plans have significant impact on overall risk.","[Tan, Samson; Weinert, Darryl; Joseph, Paul; Moinuddin, Khalid A.

Despite a well-established relationship between alcohol and risky behavior in the natural environment, laboratory investigations have not reliably shown acute alcohol effects on human risk-taking. Objectives. The present study was designed to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between acute alcohol administration and human risk taking. Further, this investigation sought to delineate behavioral mechanisms that may be involved in alcohol-induced changes in the probability of risky behavior. Methods. Using a laboratory measure of risk taking designed to address acute drug effects, 16 adults were administered placebo, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg alcohol in a within-subject repeated measures experimental design. The risk-taking task presented subjects with a choice between two response options operationally defined as risky and non-risky. Data analyses examined: breath alcohol level (BAL), subjective effects, response rates, distribution of choices between the risky and non-risky option, and trial-by-trial probabilities of making losing and winning risky responses. Results. The alcohol administration produced the expected changes in BAL, subjective effects, and response rate. Alcohol dose-dependently increased selection of the risky response option, and at the 0.8 g/kg dose, increased the probability of making consecutive losing risky responses following a gain on the risky response option. Conclusions. Acute alcohol administration can produce measurable changes in human risk-taking under laboratory conditions. Shifts in trial-by-trial response probabilities suggest insensitivity to past rewards and more recent losses when intoxicated, an outcome consistent with previous studies. This shift in sensitivity to consequences is a possible mechanism in alcohol-induced changes in risk taking.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,"Lane, SD (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, 1300 Moursund St, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",scott.d.lane@uth.tmc.edu,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA015392] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [DA R01 15392] Funding Source: Medline,,,74,94,95,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,FEB,2004,172,1,,,,,68,77,,10.1007/s00213-003-1628-2,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,777WL,WOS:000189206800009,14647967,,,,2022-04-16,

Mere presence has been found to reduce vigilance. However, animal research has also shown that chemosignals (e.g., sweat) produced during fear-inducing situations modulate individuals' threat detection strategies. In the case of humans, little is known about how exposure to conspecifics' fear chemosignals modulates vigilance and threat detection effectiveness. This study (N = 59) examined how human fear chemosignals affect vigilance strategies and threat avoidance in its receivers. We relied on a paradigm that simulates a foraging under threat situation in the lab, integrated with an eye-tracker to examine the attention allocation. Our results showed that the exposure to fear chemosignals (vs. rest chemosignals and a no-sweat condition) while not changing vigilance behavior leads to faster answers to threatening events. In conclusion, fear chemosignals seem to constitute an important warning signal for human beings, possibly leading their receiver to a readiness state that allows faster reactions to threat-related events.","[Gomes, Nuno; Semin, Gun R.] ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Semin, Gun R.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Semin, GR (corresponding author), ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal.",gun.r.semin@gmail.com,"Semin, Gun/J-4046-2013","Semin, Gun/0000-0002-5304-5566; Gomes, Nuno/0000-0002-0545-607X","Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/116653/2016, IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001]; European UnionEuropean Commission [824153]","This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [grant number: SFRH/BD/116653/2016 to NG, and grant number: IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001 to GRS].

A higher proportion of birds that had received minimal human contact withdrew as an experimenter approached in a standard test than birds that had received regular human contact (0.77 vs. 0.46, P < 0.05). Furthermore, these birds that had received minimal human contact had higher plasma corticosterone concentrations after 12 min of handling than birds in the latter treatment (12.61 vs. 5.40 nmol l(-1), P < 0.05). The usefulness of behavioural measures as indicators of the bird's fear of humans is demonstrated by these results in which handling treatments, designed to affect differentially fear of humans, caused divergence in the behavioural and adrenocortical responses of birds to humans. The major objective of the present study was addressed in Experiment 2, in which the between-farm relationships between the behavioural responses to humans and the productivity of broiler chickens were examined at 22 commercial farms. Some of the behavioural variables were significantly correlated with feed conversion (feed to gain ratio). For example, the average number of birds that approached or remained within 750 mm of an experimenter in a standard test (variable BIRDS(s)) and the number of birds that remained forward and oriented forward or to the side when an experimenter closely approached in another standard test (REMAIN(FS)) were significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) and negatively correlated with feed to gain ratio (FC) at the farm. The direction of these significant correlations indicate that feed conversion was poor at farms in which birds avoided the experimenter in the two standard tests. The variable BIRDS(s) was found to predict FC significantly (P < 0.02), and this variable accounted for 28% of the variance in feed conversion at the farms. These significant relationships between the behavioural responses of birds to an experimenter and feed conversion suggest that fear of humans may be an important factor limiting the productivity of commercial broiler chickens. The precise mechanism(s) responsible for this inverse fear-productivity relationship in broiler chickens is unclear. However, attention is drawn to the potential for improving the productivity and welfare of commercial broiler chickens by identifying and manipulating those human factors which are influential in commercial units.","LA TROBE UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,BUNDOORA,VIC 3068,AUSTRALIA; AFRC,ROSLIN INST EDINBURGH,ROSLIN EH25 9PS,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND",,"HEMSWORTH, PH (corresponding author), DEPT AGR,VICTORIAN INST ANIM SCI,475 MICKLEHAM RD,ATTWOOD,VIC 3049,AUSTRALIA.",,"Coleman, Grahame J/C-7282-2019","Coleman, Grahame/0000-0002-9558-789X; Hemsworth, Paul/0000-0002-0211-0751",,,,51,76,76,2,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1591,,,APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI,Appl.

Methods: Fear conditioning was measured. in human binge drinkers as the increased startle response in the presence of a CS + conditioned to aversive white noise. Secondly, the ability of tone CSs, paired with footshock, to induce c-fos expression, a marker of neuronal activity, in limbic structures subserving emotion was studied in rats. Additionally, consequences of RWD on subsequent induction of long term potentiation (LTP) in external capsule/lateral amygdala and Schaffer collateral/hippocampus CA1 pathways were studied in rat brain slices. Results: Fear conditioning was impaired in young human binge drinkers. The ability of fear-conditioned CSs to increase c-fos expression in limbic brain arc-as was reduced following RWD, as was LTP induction. Rats conditioned prior to RWD, following RWD showed generalization of conditioned/carfrom the tone CS+ to a neutral control stimulus, and a novel tone. Conclusions: Binge-like drinking impairs fear conditioning, reduces LTP, and results in inappropriate generalization of learned fear responses. We propose a mechanism whereby RWD-induced synaptic plasticity reduces capacity for future learning, while allowing unconditioned stimuli access to neuronal pathways underlying conditioned fear.","Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England; Humboldt Univ, Charite, Inst Psychol, Berlin, Germany",,"Stephens, DN (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",d.stephens@sussex.ac.uk,"Stephens, David/G-2384-2012; Hogarth, Lee/J-7823-2019; Borlikova, Gilyana/E-8245-2012; Schubert, Manja/AAJ-9575-2021","Hogarth, Lee/0000-0002-0299-5748; Schubert, Manja/0000-0003-3592-2470",,,,45,89,90,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

A great number of studies suggest that OT plays a role in learning and memory processes in animals and humans. Fear memories are rendered labile and prone to modification after reactivation and a restabilization and reconsolidation process is necessary for future memory conservation. This process is crucial for modulation of an existing memory and forms a promising therapeutic target for pathological memory disorders. In this study, we investigated whether a single systemic injection of OT has effects on reconsolidation of fear memories. We found post-reactivation administration of OT impairs reconsolidation of these memories and the impairment effect is reactivation-dependent. Postreactivation short-term fear memories and the learning of new fear memory were unaffected by OT. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of OT in persistently impairing fear memory retention by blocking reconsolidation in rats. OT administration after retrieval of fear memories may open a new avenue to treat pathological memory-related disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, conventional studies either separately analyze risks without considering the interaction and relationship between humans or teams, or only form a qualitative framework for team analysis. These methods cannot be directly applied for the fracturing operators due to complex operation procedures and diversified human errors. An improved methodology, therefore, is proposed to assess human holistic risk during the whole cycle of fracturing operation. First, D-S evidence theory is introduced to obtain the individual risk, and team performance shaping factor is also presented to establish risk assessment model for fracturing teams. Second, individual and team risks are integrated to calculate the quantitative value of human holistic risk. A scatter diagram of human risk is finally designed, where the high-risk fracturing stages and human types can be clearly revealed. Results from a study of one shale gas well indicate that human holistic risk is more objective and practical, and improves accuracy of human reliability analysis.","[Hu, Jinqiu; Zhang, Laibin; Wang, Qianlin; Tian, Bin] China Univ Petr, Lab Oil & Gas Prod Safety & Accid Prevent & Contr, Coll Mech & Transportat Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China",,"Wang, QL (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Lab Oil & Gas Prod Safety & Accid Prevent & Contr, Coll Mech & Transportat Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",tslinlin@126.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51574263]; Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing [2462015YQ0403, C201602]","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51574263 and Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing under Grant No. 2462015YQ0403 and No. C201602.",,33,2,2,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Previous studies conducted in brain-lesioned patients have shown that while the acquisition of autonomic fear responses requires an intact amygdala, a spared hippocampus is necessary for the development of the CS-US contingency awareness. Although these data have been supported by studies using functional neuroimaging techniques in healthy people, attempts to extend these findings to the morphological aspects of amygdala and hippocampus are missing. Here we tested the hypothesis that amygdalar and hippocampal volumes play dissociable roles in determining autonomic responses and contingency awareness during fear conditioning. Fifty-two healthy individuals (mean age 21.83) underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. We used a differential delay fear conditioning paradigm while assessing skin conductance responses (SCRs), subjective ratings of CS-US contingency, as well as emotional valence and perceived arousal. Left amygdalar volume significantly predicted the magnitude of differential SCRs during fear acquisition, but had no impact on contingency learning. Conversely, bilateral hippocampal volumes were significantly related to contingency ratings, but not to SCRs. Moreover, left amygdalar volume predicted SCRs to the reinforced CS alone, but not those elicited by the US. Our findings bridge the gap between previous lesion and functional imaging studies, by showing that amygdalar and hippocampal volumes differentially modulate the acquisition of conditioned fear. Further, our results reveal that the morphology of these limbic structures moderate learning and memory already in healthy persons.","[Cacciaglia, Raffaele; Pohlack, Sebastian T.; Flor, Herta; Nees, Frauke] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Cognit & Clin Neurosci, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Med Fac Mannheim, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany",,"Nees, F (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Dept Cognit & Clin Neurosci, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Med Fac Mannheim, Sq J5, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",frauke.nees@zi-mannheim.de,"Cacciaglia, Raffaele/X-1939-2019; Nees, Frauke/AAZ-2150-2020; Cacciaglia, Raffaele/K-9318-2019","Cacciaglia, Raffaele/0000-0002-9216-949X; Nees, Frauke/0000-0002-7796-8234; Flor, Herta/0000-0003-4809-5398",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB636/C1],The authors would like to thank R.

To address this question, we measured human brain activity following fear reminder using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and investigated whether the extinction effect can be predicted by resting-state functional connectivity ( RSFC). Behaviorally, we found no significant differences of fear ratings between the reminder group and the no reminder group at the fear acquisition and extinction stages, but spontaneous recovery during re-extinction stage appeared only in the no reminder group. Imaging data showed that functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC) and amygdala in the reminder group was greater than that in the no reminder group after fear memory reactivation. More importantly, the functional connectivity between amygdala and vmPFC of the reminder group after fear memory reactivation was positively correlated with extinction effect. These results suggest RSFC between amygdala and the vmPFC following fear reminder can predict fear extinction, which provide important insight into the neural mechanisms of fear memory after fear memory reactivation.","[Feng, Pan; Zheng, Yong; Feng, Tingyong] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yong; Feng, Tingyong] Minist Educ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China",,"Feng, TY (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Sch Psychol, 1 Tian Sheng RD, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",fengty0@swu.edu.cn,,"Feng, Tingyong/0000-0001-9278-6474","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31571128, 31271117]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU1509392]; General project of Chongqing frontier and applied basic research [cstc2015jcyjA10127]",This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31571128; 31271117) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SWU1509392) and the General project of Chongqing frontier and applied basic research (cstc2015jcyjA10127).,,54,17,19,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1749-5016,1749-5024,,SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR,Soc.

Previous research has shown that perceptual similarity with a pain-associated movement fosters the generalization of fear to novel movements. Perceptual generalization of pain-related fear is adaptive as it enables individuals to extrapolate the threat value of one movement to another without the necessity to learn anew. However, excessive spreading of fear to safe movements may become maladaptive and may lead to sustained anxiety, dysfunctional avoidance behaviors, and severe disability. A hallmark of human cognition is the ability to extract conceptual knowledge from a learning episode as well. Although this conceptual pathway may be important to understand fear generalization in chronic pain, research on this topic is lacking. We investigated acquisition and generalization of concept-based pain-related fear. During acquisition, unique exemplars of one action category (CS+; e.g., opening boxes) were followed by pain, whereas exemplars of another action category (CS-; e.g., closing boxes) were not. Subsequently, spreading of pain-related fear to novel exemplars of both action categories was tested. Participants learned to expect the pain to occur and reported more pain-related fear to the exemplars of the CS+ category compared with those of the CS- category. During generalization, fear and expectancy generalized to novel exemplars of the CS+ category, but not to the CS- category. This pattern was not corroborated in the eyeblink startle measures. This is the first study that demonstrates that pain-related fear can be acquired and generalized based on conceptual knowledge.","[Meulders, Ann; Vandael, Kristof; Vlaeyen, Johan W.

Omission of an expected outcome results in a negative PE signal, which is the initial step towards successful extinction. In order to visualize negative PE signaling during fear conditioning, we employed combined functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and skin conductance response (SCR) measurements in a Conditioning task with visual stimuli and mild electrical shocks. Positive PE signaling was associated with increased activation in the bilateral insula, supplementary motor area, brainstem, and visual cortices. Negative PE signaling was associated with increased activation in the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, the left lateral orbital gyrus, the middle temporal gyri, angular gyri, and visual cortices. The involvement of the ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex in extinction learning has been well documented, and this study provides evidence for the notion that these regions are already involved in negative PE signaling during fear conditioning.

Extinction, the laboratory analog of behavior therapy, does not erase conditioned fear memories but generates competing, fear-inhibitory extinction memories that, however, are tied to the context in which extinction occurred. Accordingly, a dominance of fear over extinction memory expression-and, thus, return of fear-is often observed if extinguished fear stimuli are encountered outside the extinction (therapy) context. We show that postextinction administration of the dopamine precursor L-dopa makes extinction memories context-independent, thus strongly reducing the return of fear in both mice and humans. Reduced fear is accompanied by decreased amygdala and enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation in both species. In humans, ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity is predicted by enhanced resting-state functional coupling of the area with the dopaminergic midbrain during the postextinction consolidation phase. Our data suggest that dopamine-dependent boosting of extinction memory consolidation is a promising avenue to improving anxiety therapy.","[Haaker, Jan; Gartmann, Nina; Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Kalisch, Raffael] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf UKE, Inst Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Gaburro, Stefano; Pape, Hans-Christian] Univ Munster, Inst Physiol Neurophysiol 1, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Sah, Anupam; Singewald, Nicolas] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Inst Pharm, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Sah, Anupam; Singewald, Nicolas] Univ Innsbruck, Ctr Mol Biosci CMBI, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Meier, Kolja; Morellini, Fabio] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Ctr Mol Neurobiol Hamburg ZNMH, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany; [Kalisch, Raffael] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Med Ctr, Neuroimaging Ctr Mainz NIC, Focus Program Translat Neurosci, D-55131 Mainz, Germany",,"Kalisch, R (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf UKE, Inst Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",raffael.kalisch@unimedizin-mainz.de,"Sah, Anupam/P-6927-2014; Lonsdorf, Tina/K-8657-2017; Gaburro, Stefano/AAN-3752-2020; Kalisch, Raffael/A-9863-2018; Kalisch, Raffael/H-6624-2016","Gaburro, Stefano/0000-0001-9297-3472; Singewald, Nicolas/0000-0002-0166-3370; Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KA1623/3-1, KA1623/4-1, SFB-TR58 A03]; State of Hamburg excellence initiative (neurodapt! consortium); Austrian Science Fund (Fonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung)Austrian Science Fund (FWF); Signal Processing in Neurons [W1206-B18];  [Sonderforschungsbereich F4410]","We thank S.

Previous studies have shown that exogenous oxytocin motivates a tend and defend pattern in inter-group conflict in which oxytocin stimulates in-group cooperation and out-group defense. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design combined with a modified Prisoner's dilemma game (PDG), we examined the effect of oxytocin on social motivations in inter-individual conflict in men. Results showed that compared with the placebo group, oxytocin-exposed participants were less cooperative in general. Specifically, oxytocin amplified the effect of fear on defection but did not influence the effect of greed. Another non-social control study confirmed participants' decisions were sensitive to social factors.

Methods We performed a randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, four-arm clinical trial in 60 healthy adults. Visual cues and electric shocks were used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US), respectively. Results The extinction or acquisition effect was not observed in the simple recall after the extinction or acquisition of coupled CS-US; however, the extinction and habituation effects but not the acquisition effects were presented after the unexpected re-exposure of coupled CS-US (reinstatement stimuli). Extinction and habituation effects were facilitated by either a single dose of DCS or VPA or a combination of DCS and VPA. However, we did not observe the expected synergistic effect of the combined treatment on the extinction or habituation of fear conditioning. Conclusion A single dose of DCS or VPA might enhance exposure-based cognitive therapy of anxiety disorders by reducing the vulnerability to reinstatement and preventing relapses of fear-conditioned responses.","[Kuriyama, Kenichi; Honma, Motoyasu; Soshi, Takahiro; Fujii, Takeshi; Kim, Yoshiharu] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Adult Mental Hlth, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan",,"Kuriyama, K (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Adult Mental Hlth, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, 4-1-1 Ogawa Higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan.",kenichik@ncnp.go.jp,"Honma, Motoyasu/M-7124-2018","Honma, Motoyasu/0000-0003-4612-0115; Soshi, Takahiro/0000-0003-1924-936X",Japan Science and Technology (JST) CorporationJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Mitsubishi Pharma Research Foundation,This work was funded by a grant from the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program from the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Corporation and a grant from Mitsubishi Pharma Research Foundation.,,49,38,38,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,DEC,2011,218,3,,,,,589,597,,10.1007/s00213-011-2353-x,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,844EM,WOS:000296730500013,21594560,,,,2022-04-16,

Memory retrieval is involved in symptom expression and maintenance of these disorders, while memory extinction is believed to be the underlying mechanism of behavioral exposure therapy of anxiety disorders. There is abundant evidence that stress and stress hormones can reduce memory retrieval of emotional information, whereas they enhance memory consolidation of extinction training. In this study we aimed at investigating if stress affects these memory processes in a fear conditioning paradigm in healthy human subjects. On day 1, fear memory was acquired through a standard differential fear conditioning procedure. On day 2 (24 h after fear acquisition), participants either underwent a stressful cold pressor test (CPT) or a control condition, 20 min before memory retrieval testing and extinction training. Possible prolonged effects of the stress manipulation were investigated on day 3 (48 h after fear acquisition), when memory retrieval and extinction were tested again. On day 2, men in the stress group showed a robust cortisol response to stress and showed lower unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings than men in the control group. This reduction in fear memory retrieval was maintained on day 3. In women, who showed a significantly smaller cortisol response to stress than men, no stress effects on fear memory retrieval were observed. No group differences were observed with respect to extinction. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that stress can reduce memory retrieval of conditioned fear in men. Our findings may contribute to the understanding of the effects of stress and glucocorticoids on fear symptoms in anxiety disorders and suggest that such effects may be sex-specific.

For conditioned fear, animal models postulate that consolidation involves reactivations of neuronal assemblies supporting fear learning during postlearning offline periods. However, no human studies to date have investigated such processes, particularly in relation to long-term expression of fear. We tested 24 participants using functional MRI on 2 consecutive days in a fear conditioning paradigm involving 1 habituation block, 2 acquisition blocks, and 2 extinction blocks on day 1, and 2 re-extinction blocks on day 2. Conditioning blocks were preceded and followed by 4.5-min rest blocks. Strength of spontaneous recovery of fear on day 2 served as a measure of long-term expression of fear. Amygdala connectivity primarily with hippocampus increased progressively during postacquisition and postextinction rest on day 1. Intraregional multi-voxel correlation structures within amygdala and hippocampus sampled during a block of differential fear conditioning furthermore persisted after fear learning. Critically, both these main findings were stronger in participants who exhibited spontaneous recovery 24 h later. Our findings indicate that neural circuits activated during fear conditioning exhibit persistent postlearning activity that may be functionally relevant in promoting consolidation of the fear memory.","[Hermans, Erno J.; Kanen, Jonathan W.; Davachi, Lila; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Tambini, Arielle; Davachi, Lila; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Hermans, Erno J.; Fernandez, Guillen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 EN Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Hermans, Erno J.; Fernandez, Guillen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6525 EN Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Kanen, Jonathan W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Tambini, Arielle] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Phelps, Elizabeth A.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA",,"Hermans, EJ (corresponding author), Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, POB 9101, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands.",Erno.Hermans@donders.ru.nl,"Tambini, Arielle/I-3895-2019; Fernandez, Guillen/B-3771-2009; Hermans, Erno J./B-1610-2010; Kanen, Jonathan/AAD-8339-2021","Fernandez, Guillen/0000-0002-5522-0604; Davachi, Lila/0000-0003-4317-0889; Kanen, Jonathan/0000-0002-4095-5405; Tambini, Arielle/0000-0001-9200-9165",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific ResearchNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [451.07.019]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH080756]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH097085] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This work was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (grant number 451.07.019 to E.J.H.) and the National Institutes of Health (grant number MH080756 to E.A.P.).,,86,37,38,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1047-3211,1460-2199,,CEREB CORTEX,Cereb.

Phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are characterized by abnormal and persistent memories of fear-related contexts and cues. The effects of psychological treatments such as exposure therapy are often only temporary and medications can be ineffective and have adverse side effects. Growing evidence from human and animal studies indicates that cannabidiol, the main non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid present in Cannabis sativa, alleviates anxiety in paradigms assessing innate fear. More recently, the effects of cannabidiol on learned fear have been investigated in preclinical studies with translational relevance for phobias and PTSD. Here we review the findings from these studies, with an emphasis on cannabidiol regulation of contextual fear. The evidence indicates that cannabidiol reduces learned fear in different ways: (1) cannabidiol decreases fear expression acutely, (2) cannabidiol disrupts memory reconsolidation, leading to sustained fear attenuation upon memory retrieval, and (3) cannabidiol enhances extinction, the psychological process by which exposure therapy inhibits learned fear. We also present novel data on cannabidiol regulation of learned fear related to explicit cues, which indicates that auditory fear expression is also reduced acutely by cannabidiol. We conclude by outlining future directions for research to elucidate the neural circuit, psychological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of fear memory processing by cannabidiol. This line of investigation may lead to the development of cannabidiol as a novel therapeutic approach for treating anxiety and trauma-related disorders such as phobias and PTSD in the future.","[Jurkus, Regimantas] Univ Nottingham, Sch Math Sci, Univ Pk, Nottingham, England; [Day, Harriet L.

Electrophysiology also has provided insight into these mechanisms through the examination of event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the P100 and LPP. It remains unclear, however, whether the P100 and LPP may be related to fear learning processes within the FPS paradigm. To this end, we tested differences in ERP amplitudes for conditioned stimuli associated (CS +) and not associated (CS-) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear acquisition. Participants included 54 female undergraduate students (mean age = 20.26). The FPS response was measured via electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscle. EEG data were collected during the FPS paradigm. While the difference between CS + and CS- P100 amplitude was not significant, LPP amplitudes were significantly enhanced following the CS + relative to CS-. Furthermore, the LPP difference wave (CS + minus CS-) was associated with FPS scores for the CS- during the later portion of fear acquisition. These findings suggest that conditioned stimuli may have altered emotional encoding (LPP) during the FPS paradigm. Thus, the LPP may be a promising neurophysiological marker that is related to fear learning processes.","[Seligowski, Antonia, V; Singleton, Paris; Ressler, Kerry J.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA USA; [Seligowski, Antonia, V; Singleton, Paris; Ressler, Kerry J.; Auerbach, Randy P.] McLean Hosp, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02178 USA; [Bondy, Erin] Washington Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, St Louis, MO USA; [Orcutt, Holly K.] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Psychol, De Kalb, IL USA; [Auerbach, Randy P.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Auerbach, Randy P.] Div Clin Dev Neurosci, New York, NY USA",,"Seligowski, AV (corresponding author), McLean Hosp, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02178 USA.",aseligowski@mclean.harvard.edu,"Auerbach, Randy Patrick/V-8079-2019","Orcutt, Holly/0000-0002-0197-0784; Bondy, Erin/0000-0002-1839-2378",National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K23MH097786]; Tommy Fuss Fund,The project was supported through funding from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) K23MH097786 (RPA) and Tommy Fuss Fund (RPA).

Classical conditioning models elegantly describe how animals learn which stimuli in the environment signal danger, but understanding how this learning is generalized to other stimuli that resemble aspects of a learned threat remains a challenge. Critically, the overgeneralization of fear to harmless stimuli or situations is a burden to daily life and characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders. Here, we review emerging evidence on behavioral and neural mechanisms of generalization of emotional learning with the goal of encouraging further research on generalization in anxiety disorders. We begin by placing research on fear generalization in a rich historical context of stimulus generalization dating back to Pavlov, which lays the foundation for theoretical and experimental approaches used today. We then transition to contemporary behavioral and neurobiological research on generalization of emotional learning in humans and nonhuman animals and discuss the factors that promote generalization on the one hand from discrimination on the other hand.","[Dunsmoor, Joseph E.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Dunsmoor, Joseph E.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Paz, Rony] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,"Dunsmoor, JE (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",joseph.dunsmoor@nyu.edu,"Dunsmoor, Joseph/U-9183-2019",,ISFIsrael Science Foundation [26613]; I-CORE [51/11]; ERC-FP7-StG [281171],"This work was supported by ISF 26613, I-CORE 51/11, and ERC-FP7-StG 281171 Grants to R.

Fear conditioning paradigms can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying the neurobiological ontogeny of anxiety. A small number of studies have focused on the effects of age and anxiety separately in school age children. The present study aimed to investigate these effects in 8-13 year old children with higher and lower trait anxiety. We examined differential fear conditioning and extinction using skin conductance responses and fear-potentiated startle in 60 children recruited from a low-income urban population. The results indicated that children under 10 years of age show poor discrimination of conditioned stimuli, and that anxiety increases fear responses during fear acquisition. After controlling for age and trauma exposure, fear-potentiated startle to the safety cue predicted child anxiety levels suggesting that impaired safety signal learning may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders in adulthood. Identifying risk phenotypes in children may provide opportunities for early intervention and prevention of illness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This test measures conditioned fear by an increase in the amplitude of a simple reflex (the acoustic startle reflex) in the presence of a cue previously paired with a shock. Fear-potentiated startle is sensitive to a variety of drugs such as diazepam, morphine, and buspirone that reduce anxiety in people and can be measured reliably in humans when the eyeblink component of startle is elicited at a time when they are anticipating a shock. Electrical stimulation techniques suggest that a visual conditioned stimulus ultimately alters acoustic startle at a specific point along the acoustic startle pathway. The lateral, basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei and the caudal branch of the ventral amygdalofugal pathway projecting to the brainstem are necessary for potentiated startle to occur. The central nucleus of the amygdala projects directly to one of the brainstem nuclei critical for startle and electrical stimulation of this nucleus increases startle amplitude. Chemical or electrolytic lesions of either the central nucleus or the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala block the expression of fear-potentiated startle. The perirhinal cortex, which projects directly to the lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei, plays a critical role in the expression of fear-potentiated startle using either visual or auditory conditioned stimuli. These latter amygdaloid nuclei may actually be the site of plasticity for fear conditioning, because local infusion of the NMDA antagonist AP5 into these nuclei blocks the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle. On the other hand, the expression of fear-potentiated startle is blocked by local infusion of the non-NMDA ionotropic antagonist CNQX or the G-protein inactivating toxin, pertussis toxin, but not by AP5. Finally, we have begun to investigate brain systems that might be involved in the inhibition of fear. Local infusion of AP5 into the amygdala was found to block the acquisition of experimental extinction, a prototypical method for reducing fear. We have also established a reliable procedure for producing both external and conditioned inhibition of fear-potentiated startle and hope to eventually understand the neural systems involved in these phenomena.",,,"DAVIS, M (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH MED,CONNECTICUT MENTAL HLTH CTR,RIBICOFF RES FACILITIES,DEPT PSYCHIAT,NEW HAVEN,CT 06508, USA.",,"Falls, William/D-1208-2013","Falls, William/0000-0002-9246-1474","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [NIMH MH-25642, NIMH MH-00004, NIMH MH-47840] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P01MH025642, R01MH047840, R37MH047840] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,159,556,558,2,45,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4328,,,BEHAV BRAIN RES,Behav.

Our aim was to develop a general questionnaire based on relevant previous studies in order to facilitate the standardization of measurements of fear-related behaviour in dogs (social fear, non-social fear, separation problems, anxiety/destructiveness and neuroticism). We investigated which aspects of fear do emerge as distinct factors when measuring fear in dogs with our consensus questionnaire. We developed the questionnaire by piercing together seven discrete fear-related factors from six previous studies representing different aspects of fear. Our final questionnaire consisted of 56 items and was filled out by 833 Hungarian pet dog owners. Principal component analysis was applied to explore the factorial structure of the questionnaire scores. The original seven factors used in developing the questionnaire did not emerged as discrete factors. Instead, we found four factors (33 questionnaire items) labeled as neuroticism (CAA = 0.87), dog-directed fear (CRA = 0.84), human-directed fear (CRA = 0.90) and separation-related behavior (CRA = 0.83). The effects of demographic and dog keeping characteristics on these factors were also tested by generalized linear models (GLMs). For example, toy dogs had a higher risk to show neuroticism and dog-directed fear. Female owners were more frequently reporting human-directed fear in their dogs. Female dogs showed higher level of dog-directed fear. Older dogs score was higher on neuroticism and neuroticism correlated with the time of acquisition. The standardization of specific trait measures provides an advantage to the researchers in constructing further, more specific tools and offers a greater comparability of research across dog and human populations.

Therefore, we examined differences between individuals with panic attacks (PA; N = 21) and healthy controls (HC, N = 22) in contextual learning and context generalization using a virtual reality (VR) paradigm. Successful context conditioning was indicated in both groups by higher arousal, anxiety and contingency ratings, and increased startle responses and skin conductance levels (SCLs) in an anxiety context (CTX+) where an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) occurred unpredictably vs. a safety context (CTX-). PA compared to HC exhibited increased differential responding to CTX+ vs. CTX- and overgeneralization of contextual anxiety on an evaluative verbal level, but not on a physiological level. We conclude that increased contextual conditioning and contextual generalization may constitute risk factors for PD or agoraphobia contributing to the characteristic avoidance of anxiety contexts and withdrawal to safety contexts and that evaluative cognitive process may play a major role.","[Neueder, Dorothea; Andreatta, Marta; Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany; [Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Med Fac, Ctr Mental Hlth, Wurzburg, Germany",,"Pauli, P (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany.; Pauli, P (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Med Fac, Ctr Mental Hlth, Wurzburg, Germany.",pauli@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Andreatta, Marta/Y-6551-2019","Andreatta, Marta/0000-0002-1217-8266","Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders [SFB-TRR 58]; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [44541416]; University of Wuerzburg (Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg)","The work was supported by the Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders,'' SFB-TRR 58 project B01.

This review focuses on how fear conditioning research, mainly using exteroceptive conditioned stimuli (CSs) and aversive, non-noxious stimuli as unconditioned stimuli (USs), has been extended and translated to chronic pain research. We describe the different pain-related fear conditioning paradigms using proprioceptive and interoceptive CSs and painful stimuli as USs that have been developed to study specific forms of pain-related fear (i.e. fear of movement, fear of touch, fear of visceral sensations, and fear of penetration) that are relevant for different chronic pain conditions (i.e. musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain, and genital pain). We present evidence that patients with chronic pain demonstrate impaired safety learning and excessive fear generalization; learning anomalies that have also been observed in anxiety disorders. Extinction-based protocols (exposure in vivo) have been developed to reduce pain-related fear and increase daily functioning in various chronic pain disorders. Finally, we outline some challenges and future directions to further our understanding of learning mechanisms underlying the development, persistence, and treatment of chronic pain disability.","[Meulders, Ann] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Grp Hlth Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Meulders, Ann] Maastricht Univ, Dept Clin Psychol Sci, Expt Hlth Psychol, Maastricht, Netherlands",,"Meulders, A (corresponding author), Fac Psychol & Neurosci, Expt Hlth Psychol, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",ann.meulders@kuleuven.be,,"Meulders, Ann/0000-0003-4250-3928","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen), BelgiumFWO [12E3717N]; Vidi grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), The Netherlands [452-17-002]","Ann Meulders is supported by a Senior Research Fellowship of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen), Belgium, (grant ID 12E3717N) and a Vidi grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), The Netherlands (grant ID 452-17-002).",,205,26,26,8,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

Here, we used Pavlovian fear conditioning to systematically investigate whether threat intensity widens behavioral generalization gradients to stimuli that decreasingly resemble a learned threat cue. Using a between-subjects design, volunteers underwent fear conditioning with a tone paired with either a high-intensity or low-intensity aversive stimulus prior to a test of fear generalization to novel tones. Results showed no effect of threat intensity on initial acquisition of conditioned fear. However, volunteers who underwent fear conditioning with a high-intensity aversive stimulus exhibited widespread generalization of autonomic arousal (skin conductance responses) as compared to volunteers who received a low-intensity aversive stimulus. These results show a transition from normal (selective) to overgeneralized fear as threat intensity increases, and have implications for understanding overgeneralization characteristic of trauma-and stress-related disorders.","[Dunsmoor, Joseph E.; Kroes, Marijn C.

Expressions were presented in pseudo-random order on a computer monitor. For half of the participants, the fear expression was paired with an aversive electric stimulation (UCS), whereas the happy expression was unpaired. The other participants had the opposite pairing. To assess the influence of conditioned fear on pain, expressions were shown again in the absence of the UCS and pain threshold was assessed during each expression. The latency of finger withdrawal from a radiant heat device was used to index pain threshold. Skin conductance response (SCR) and self-reported emotion were measured to assess fear conditioning. Consistent with preparedness theory, differential fear conditioning was only present when the fear expression was paired with the UCS. Moreover, pain threshold was only influenced by fear conditioning in persons for whom the fear expression was paired with the UCS. Specifically, finger withdrawal latencies were lower (suggesting hyperalgesia) during the fear expression than during the happy expression; an effect that was not present before CS-UCS pairing. This work suggests that some stimuli are more readily associated with an aversive event and can lead to pain enhancement. Perspective: Although preliminary, these results suggest that fear-relevant environmental stimuli (including facial expressions) may provide important environmental cues during aversive events that influence the level of pain experienced.","Univ Tulsa, Dept Psychol, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA",,"Rhudy, JL (corresponding author), Univ Tulsa, Dept Psychol, 600 S Coll, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.",jamie-rhudy@utulsa.edu,,,,,,33,41,42,0,5,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",1526-5900,,,J PAIN,J.

His line of inquiry has stood the test of time. In late 2012, the nationally representative South African Social Attitudes Survey replicated Cantril's 1960s questions and methodology to elicit South Africans' hopes and aspirations and worries and fears for self and country and their ratings of where self and country stood-past, present and will stand in future. Although Cantril's 'ladder-of life' scale is still regularly used as a measure of subjective well-being, to our knowledge his full line of preliminary questioning has not been fielded again to date. Our study found that South African aspirations for self were mainly material ones for a decent standard of living and the means to achieve this goal. Hopes for the nation concentrated on economic and political progress to consolidate South Africa's democracy. A large number of personal and national hopes were mirrored in fears that these aspirations might not be met. Cantril's method also allowed us to review the main concerns and ratings across the diverse groups of citizens that make up the 'rainbow nation'. There was a substantial degree of consensus on top hopes and fears but levels of standing on the Cantril ladder of life were still graded according to apartheidera inequalities with black South Africans scoring lower than other race groups. Nonetheless, the majority of South Africans rated their present life better than 5 years ago and projected life to get better in future. Such optimism may place considerable pressure on the state to deliver on personal and societal hopes as the country enters its third decade of democracy.","[Moller, Valerie] Rhodes Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Prof Emeritus, Qual Life Studies, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Roberts, Benjamin J.] Human Sci Res Council, Democracy Governance & Serv Delivery Res Programm, Durban, South Africa",,"Moller, V (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Prof Emeritus, Qual Life Studies, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",v.moller@ru.ac.za; broberts@hsrc.ac.za,"Mller, Valerie/R-2339-2016","Mller, Valerie/0000-0003-1463-1914; Roberts, Benjamin/0000-0002-0607-5447",National Research Foundation (NRF) of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [UID 77926],"The idea of replicating Cantril's line of questioning was sparked by Richard Easterlin. In the book to mark his winning the prestigious IZA Prize in Labour Economics in 2009, Easterlin (2010, p. 254) notes that: Analysts sometimes try to infer time series change by comparing the responses to ladder-of-life questions of the type asked in the recent Gallup World Poll to Cantril's (1965) results. To assume the recent responses are comparable to Cantril's is questionable. Before presenting respondents with the ladder-of-life question, Cantril's interviewers conducted a lengthy in-depth interview probing the respondents' concerns about the best and worst of all possible worlds (Chapter 1 and Cantril 1965, pp. 22-24). The recent ladder-of-life questions have no counterpart to this lengthy preamble.

An earlier experiment indicated that reactions to humans and novelty had some repeatability between the ages of 8 and 24 weeks, thus reflecting personality traits. The present experiment therefore tested for predicted negative relationships between behaviour related to fear and anxiety measured at 8 weeks of age and later reproduction in 30 sows. Factor analysis of behaviour in a voluntary human approach test performed in the home cage and a novel object test performed in a novel arena indicated that behavioural measures related to investigation of these stimuli loaded on separate factors and may therefore reflect independent underlying dimensions. One factor related to investigation of the human was interpreted as reflecting the level of fear of humans, while another was correlated to investigation of the novel object and interpreted as indicating novelty-induced anxiety. Factor scores were generated for 'fear' and 'anxiety' and used in regression analysis as predictors of maternal behaviour and reproductive parameters. Higher levels of fear of humans were associated with longer durations of farrowing, larger variation in inter-birth intervals, and a higher number of piglets dying without milk in their stomachs. The duration of farrowing was positively correlated to the number of live born piglets dying within 3 weeks of age. Higher fear also tended to associate with a higher number of stillborn and a higher number of live born piglets dying within 3 weeks of age. High anxiety only tended to be associated with a higher number of stillborn. These results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that there are negative associations between fear of humans and maternal ability in sows. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The cues differed with respect to the strength of their shock association (L < P < H) and the uncertainty of their prediction (L < P > H). During conditioning we measured pupil dilation and ocular fixations to index differences in the attentional processing of the cues. After conditioning, the shock-associated colors were introduced as irrelevant distracters during visual search for a shape target while shocks were no longer administered and we analyzed the cues' potential to capture and hold overt attention automatically. Our findings suggest that fear conditioning creates an automatic attention bias for the conditioned cues that depends on their correlation with the aversive outcome. This bias was exclusively linked to the strength of the cues' shock association for the early attentional processing of cues in the visual periphery, but additionally was influenced by the uncertainty of the shock prediction after participants fixated on the cues. These findings are in accord with attentional learning theories that formalize how associative learning shapes automatic attention.","[Koenig, Stephan; Uengoer, Metin; Lachnit, Harald] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Psychol, Marburg, Germany",,"Koenig, S (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Psychol, Marburg, Germany.",koenigst@uni-marburg.de,"Lachnit, Harald/A-9640-2008","Lachnit, Harald/0000-0003-0182-838X; Uengoer, Metin/0000-0001-5453-2860; Koenig, Stephan/0000-0001-8083-4184",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TRR 135],"The research was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG), collaborative research center SFB/TRR 135 Cardinal mechanisms of perception.",,67,20,20,1,20,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,,,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

These compounds generally have low water solubility, do not degrade readily in the environment, bioaccumulate in food chains, and have been linked to adverse health effects in both humans and wildlife. The presence of such compounds in terrestrial and aquatic food chains is relevant to those concerned with both human health and environmental protection because of the many common exposure pathways and biological effects among different species. In the past, some chemicals with health risks for humans have been identified following reports of adverse effects in wildlife. Integrating human and ecological risk assessments may improve society's ability to manage the design, manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals in a safe and efficient manner. This can be demonstrated with this case study, which summarizes approaches to evaluating the sources, transport and fate of certain POPs, used largely in the past, and their associated health risks to humans and biota.","Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Studies, Marine Environm Qual Sect, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada; US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA",,"Ross, PS (corresponding author), Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Studies, Marine Environm Qual Sect, POB 6000, Sidney, BC V8L 4B2, Canada.",rosspe@pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca,,,,,,92,52,55,3,58,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Animal and human studies have demonstrated fear processing abilities are moderated by circadian rhythms, however, the influence of circadian disruption on fear inhibition is not well understood. Here, we examined the effects of circadian disruption on fear inhibition processes (i.e., fear extinction and safety learning) in a pre-clinical model. Adult male C57Bl/6 J mice completed cued fear and safety conditioning in the active phase before undergoing acute shifts in the Light-Dark (LD) cycle. Specifically, the light-phase was advanced by eight-hours across a one-day period (Experiment 1) or a two-day period (Experiment 2), before returning to original timing. Fear and safety recall were assessed over two days following LD shifts. Control groups maintained one LD cycle throughout both experiments. In both experiments, mice allocated to LD shifted groups revealed misaligned patterns of previously circadian locomotor activity. In the second recall session of Experiment 1, LD shifted mice demonstrated reduced retention of conditioned safety memory. However, in Experiment 2, LD shifted mice displayed heightened fear across conditioned fear cues in both recall sessions, therefore demonstrating consistent fear extinction impairment. Moreover, in recall session two, these mice revealed impaired ability to suppress fear during initial presentations of fear and safety cues. Overall, our data suggest maintaining a consistent LD cycle may be crucially important to individuals at high-risk of trauma-exposure and subsequent development of posttraumatic stress disorder.","[Clark, Jacob W.; Cain, Sean W.; Phillips, Andrew; Drummond, Sean P.

In contrast, the generalization of fear responses toward nonthreatening cues is a maladaptive and debilitating dimension of trauma-and anxiety-related disorders. Expressing fear to appropriate stimuli and suppressing fear generalization require integration of relevant sensory information and motor output. While thalamic and subthalamic brain regions play important roles in sensorimotor integration, very little is known about the contribution of these regions to the phenomenon of fear generalization. In this study, we sought to determine whether fear generalization could be modulated by the zona incerta (ZI), a subthalamic brain region that influences sensory discrimination, defensive responses, and retrieval of fear memories. To do so, we combined differential intensity-based auditory fear conditioning protocols in mice with C-FOS immunohistochemistry and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)-based manipulation of neuronal activity in the ZI. C-FOS immunohistochemistry revealed an inverse relationship between ZI activation and fear generalization: The ZI was less active in animals that generalized fear. In agreement with this relationship, chemogenetic inhibition of the ZI resulted in fear generalization, while chemogenetic activation of the ZI suppressed fear generalization. Furthermore, targeted stimulation of GABAergic cells in the ZI reduced fear generalization. To conclude, our data suggest that stimulation of the ZI could be used to treat fear generalization in the context of trauma-and anxiety-related disorders.","[Venkataraman, Archana; Dias, Brian George] Emory Univ, Neurosci Grad Program, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Venkataraman, Archana; Brody, Natalia; Reddi, Preethi; Guo, Jidong; Rainnie, Donald Gordon; Dias, Brian George] Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Behav Neurosci & Psychiat Disorders, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Rainnie, Donald Gordon; Dias, Brian George] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA",,"Dias, BG (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Neurosci Grad Program, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.; Dias, BG (corresponding author), Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Behav Neurosci & Psychiat Disorders, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.; Dias, BG (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",bdias@emory.edu,,"Venkataraman, Archana/0000-0002-2991-7395; Dias, Brian/0000-0001-9727-4873","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; Brain Health Center; Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC); Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) Azrieli Global Scholar AwardCanadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Catherine Shopshire Hardman Fund; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [ODP51OD11132]; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P51OD011132] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the Yerkes Veterinary and Animal Care staff for animal husbandry.

Whether materials are present in the environment naturally (mercury, radon, nitrogen, phosphorous) and enhanced by human activities or are man-made (DDT and PCBs), the complexity of contaminant distributions and sources requires careful design and implementation of studies to characterize background. Before collection or analyses of data are initiated, an explicit definition of background appropriate to specific risk assessments is needed. Problems associated with determining background levels of contaminants in fish and seafood illustrate some challenges faced by risk assessors. Major differences in estimates of background may result from differences in sampling and analytical methods including selection of sampling locations, approaches to data analysis and synthesis, and tissues selected for analysis. Different approaches may yield background exposure or risk estimates that differ by 50% or more. Methodological transparency is essential in data collection and analysis to establish background and to ensure that data are used appropriately in both human and ecological risk assessments.","Univ Washington, Inst Risk Anal & Risk Commun, Seattle, WA 98105 USA",,"Faustman, EM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Inst Risk Anal & Risk Commun, 4225 Roosevelt Way NE 100, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",faustman@u.washington.edu,"Karr, James Richard/AAD-5995-2022","Karr, James Richard/0000-0001-5973-1121",,,,26,3,3,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

When Reference Doses (RfDs) or Reference Concentrations (RfCs) are based upon no-effect levels from human rather than animal data, an animal-to-human uncertainty factor (usually 10) is not required, which could conceivably result in a higher safe exposure limit. There has been little in the way of study of the effect of using human vs. animal data on the development of RfDs and RfCs to lend empirical support to this argument. We have recently completed an analysis comparing RfDs and RfCs derived from human data with toxicity values for the same chemicals based on animal data. The results, published in detail elsewhere, are summarized here. We found that the use of human data did not always result in higher RfDs or RfCs. In 36% of the comparisons, human-based RfDs or RfCs were lower than the corresponding animal-based toxicity values, and were more than 3-fold lower in 23% of the comparisons. In 10 out of 43 possible comparisons (23%), insufficient experimental animal data are readily available or data are inappropriate to estimate either RfDs or RfCs. Although there are practical limitations in conducting this type of analysis, it nonetheless suggests that the use of human data does not routinely lead to higher toxicity values. Given the inherent ability of human data to reduce uncertainty regarding risks from human exposures, its use in conjunction with data gathered from experimental animals is a public health protective policy that should be encouraged.","Toxicol Excellence Risk Assessment, Cincinnati, OH 45223 USA; Exponent, New York, NY USA",,"Dourson, ML (corresponding author), Toxicol Excellence Risk Assessment, 1757 Chase Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45223 USA.",dourson@tera.org,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

However, when fear occurs in inappropriate circumstances, it can lead to pathological conditions including an increased vulnerability for developing anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients with PTSD generalize fear to contexts or to environments that are not associated with the trauma. We sought to explore if increasing the level of dissimilarity relative to the context in which mice learn fear results in changes in the level of fear responding to the new context. We also determined with this procedure if the number of cells expressing the immediate early gene cfos changes with the corresponding level of expressed fear within brain regions known to be important in modulating fear, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and hippocampus. Our results indicate that mice that were tested in increasingly different contexts showed significantly different levels of fear responses. Freezing level was higher in the context most similar to the acquisition context than the one that was highly different. The level of cfos within the BLA, but not hippocampus, was also significantly different between the test contexts, with higher levels in the somewhat similar compared with the most different context. Overall, these results highlight the BLA as a critical region in the node of fear circuitry for modulating fear generalization.

Mouse lines selectively bred for high (HAP) or low (LAP) alcohol preference may be a relevant model of genetic risk for co-morbid alcoholism and PTSD in humans. HAP mice show greater fear-potentiated startle (FPS), a model used to study PTSD, than LAP mice. The relation between corticosterone (CORT) and FPS behavior was explored in four experiments. Naive male and female HAP2 and LAP2 mice received fear-conditioning or control treatments, and CORT levels were measured before and immediately after fear-conditioning or FPS testing. In two other experiments, HAP2 mice received CORT (1.0, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) or a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (mifepristone; 25.0 and 50.0 mg/kg) 30 minutes before fear conditioning. HAP2 mice exposed to fear conditioning and to control foot shock exposures showed lower CORT after the fear-conditioning and FPS testing sessions than LAP2 mice. A trend toward higher FPS was seen in HAP2 mice pretreated with 10.0 mg/kg CORT, and CORT levels were the lowest in this group, suggesting negative feedback inhibition of CORT release. Mifepristone did not alter FPS. Overall, these results are consistent with data in humans and rodents indicating that lower cortisol/CORT levels after stress are associated with PTSD/PTSD-like behavior. These findings in HAP2 and LAP2 mice suggest that a blunted CORT response to stress may be a biological marker for greater susceptibility to develop PTSD in individuals with increased genetic risk for alcoholism.","[Chester, Julia A.; Kirchhoff, Aaron M.; Barrenha, Gustavo D.] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Chester, JA (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, 703 Third St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jchester@psych.purdue.edu,,," [AA016843];  [AA015512]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R24AA015512, R01AA016843, P60AA007611, U24AA015512] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Supported by AA016843 (J.A.C.).

Design: During the Conditioning phase, a mild, 0.5-sec shock followed conditioned stimuli (CS+s), which consisted of 2 differently colored lamps. A third lamp color was interspersed but never reinforced (CS-). Immediately after Conditioning, one CS+ was extinguished (CS+E) by presentation without shocks (Extinction phase). The other CS+ went unextinguished (CS+U). Twelve hours later, following continuous normal daytime waking (Wake group, N = 27) or an equal interval containing a normal night's sleep (Sleep group, N = 26), conditioned responses (CRs) to all CSs were measured (Extinction Recall phase). It was hypothesized that the Sleep versus Wake group would show greater extinction recall and/or generalization of extinction recall from the CS+E to the CS+U. Setting: Academic medical center. Subjects: Paid normal volunteers. Measurements and Results: Square-root transformed skin conductance response (SCR) measured conditioned responding. During Extinction Recall, the Group (Wake or Sleep) x CS+ Type (CS+E or CS+U) interaction was significant (P = 0.04). SCRs to the CS+E did not differ between groups, whereas SCRs to the CS+U were significantly smaller in the Sleep group. Additionally, SCRs were significantly larger to the CS+U than CS+E in the Wake but not the Sleep group. Conclusions: After sleep, extinction memory generalized from an extinguished conditioned stimulus to a similarly conditioned but unextinguished stimulus. Clinically, adequate sleep may promote generalization of extinction memory from specific stimuli treated during exposure therapy to similar stimuli later encountered in vivo.","[Pace-Schott, Edward F.; Stickgold, Robert] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat,Ctr Sleep & Cognit, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Pace-Schott, Edward F.; Milad, Mohammed R.; Orr, Scott P.; Pitman, Roger K.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Massachusetts Gen Hosp,Psychophysiol Lab, Charlestown, MA USA; [Orr, Scott P.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, Manchester, NH USA; [Rauch, Scott L.] Harvard Univ, McLean Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Belmont, MA 02178 USA",,"Pace-Schott, EF (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat,Ctr Sleep & Cognit, Feldberg 864,E Campus,330 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",epacesch@bidmc.harvard.edu,"Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018",,NIDAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [RO IDA 11744]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH048832] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA011744] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Work was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA.

This study aimed at investigating brain alterations in a rodent model of depression when innate fear was induced in the form of the predator odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT). Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats, a genetic animal model of depression, and their control counterpart Flinders resistant line (FRL), were used in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessment. Compared to FRL, FSL rats exhibited greater BOLD activation in the cortical amygdala and hypoactivation in the prefrontal cortex in response to TMT, suggesting cortico-amygdalar dysfunction in the depressed strain. In addition, the hyperactivation in the insular cortex in FSL rats may be the basis for enhanced neuronal responses to fear and aversion in depression.

This circuitry is evolutionarily crucial for survival, but its dysregulation is thought to play a major role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions in humans. The amygdala is a key player in the processing of fear. This brain area is prominently modulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). The 5-HT input to the amygdala has drawn particular interest because genetic and pharmacological alterations of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) affect amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli. Nonetheless, the impact of 5-HT on fear processing remains poorly understood. The aim of this review is to elucidate the physiological role of 5-HT in fear learning via its action on the neuronal circuits of the amygdala. Since 5-HT release increases in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during both fear memory acquisition and expression, we examine whether and how 5-HT neurons encode aversive stimuli and aversive cues. Next, we describe pharmacological and genetic alterations of 5-HT neurotransmission that, in both rodents and humans, lead to altered fear learning. To explore the mechanisms through which 5-HT could modulate conditioned fear, we focus on the rodent BLA. We propose that a circuit-based approach taking into account the localization of specific 5-HT receptors on neurochemically-defined neurons in the BLA may be essential to decipher the role of 5-HT in emotional behavior. In keeping with a 5-HT control of fear learning, we review electrophysiological data suggesting that 5-HT regulates synaptic plasticity, spike synchrony and theta oscillations in the BLA via actions on different subcellular compartments of principal neurons and distinct GABAergic interneuron populations. Finally, we discuss how recently developed optogenetic tools combined with electrophysiological recordings and behavior could progress the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying 5-HT modulation of fear learning via action on amygdala circuits. Such advancement could pave the way for a deeper understanding of 5-HT in emotional behavior in both health and disease.","[Bocchio, Marco; Capogna, Marco] Univ Oxford, Dept Pharmacol, MRS Brain Network Dynam Unit, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QT, England; [McHugh, Stephen B.; Bannerman, David M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3UD, England; [Sharp, Trevor] Univ Oxford, Dept Pharmacol, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QT, England",,"Bocchio, M; Capogna, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Pharmacol, MRS Brain Network Dynam Unit, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QT, England.",marco.bocchio@gmail.com; marco.capogna@pharm.ox.ac.uk,"McHugh, Stephen/X-7240-2019; Bocchio, Marco/B-7844-2018","McHugh, Stephen/0000-0003-4739-453X; Bocchio, Marco/0000-0002-7005-3453; Sharp, Trevor/0000-0001-7434-9713; Capogna, Marco/0000-0002-2742-5485; Bannerman, David/0000-0002-3024-7595","Medical Research Council, UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [U138197106]; Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship awardWellcome Trust [087736]; LundbeckLundbeck Corporation; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_UU_12020/2] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [1221547, MC_UU_12020/2] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was supported by the Medical Research Council, UK (award U138197106) and a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship award (Grant No. 087736).

While previous research has provided much evidence for the repercussions of social exclusion on mental health, how social exclusion affects fear acquisition and generalization has received scant attention. In our study, participants were divided into two groups according to two Cyberball paradigm conditions (exclusion/ inclusion). Both groups underwent a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and skin conductance response (SCR) assessments. We aimed to determine the effects of social exclusion on fear acquisition and generalization and whether modulation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates this relationship. Our results showed that socially excluded participants featured significantly higher and lower shock risk scores to safety stimuli (conditioned stimulus, CS-) and threatening stimuli (CS+), respectively, than did socially included subjects during fear acquisition. The exclusion group had increased skin conductance re-sponses (SCRs) to CS and exhibited heightened shock risk and increased SCRs to generalized stimuli compared with the inclusion group. The fNIRS results demonstrated that the CS + evoked larger oxy-Hb changes in the mPFC in the inclusion group than in the exclusion group during fear acquisition. Furthermore, the oxy-Hb of left mPFC of CS + mediated the effect on the association between social exclusion and perceived risk of CS+ in the fear acquisition. Our results indicate that social exclusion impairs fear acquisition and generalization via the mediation of the mPFC and that social exclusion increases susceptibility to anxiety disorders through bias pro-cessing of fear discrimination in fear acquisition and generalization. By studying the role of social relationship in fear acquisition and generalization, our research provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of anxiety disorder.","[Dou, H.; Lei, Y.] Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Brain & Psychol Sci, 5 Jingan Rd, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Dou, H.; Lei, Y.; Cheng, X.; Wang, J.] Univ Shenzhen, Coll Psychol & Soc, Shenzhen 518067, Peoples R China; [Dou, H.; Wang, J.; Leppanen, P.

These tests involved situations classically reported to induce fear in sheep: isolation from conspecifics, surprise effect and presence of a human. Twenty five behavioural items related to fear were recorded. Furthermore, synthetic fearfulness scores based upon those items were calculated; the higher the score, the more fearful the animal, It was shown that wethers were more fearful than rams in the various test situations. Their overall fearfulness scores were respectively 12.3 +/- 1.1 and 8.7 +/- 2.1 in the surprise test (P = 0.001), and 11.7 +/- 0.7 and 9.3 +/- 2.7 in the human test (P = 0.03). In the isolation test, although non-significant (P = 0.06), the scores also indicate a higher level of fearfulness for wethers (11.7 +/- 2.7 vs, 9.3 +/- 2.2). Androgens may be responsible for such differences and this is in line with previous results showing that male sheep are less fearful than females, and that androgen-treated ewes are less fearful than untreated controls.","INRA,CTR TOURS NOUZILLY,LAB ETUD COMPORTEMENT ANIM,F-37380 NOUZILLY,FRANCE",,,,,,,,,67,21,21,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1591,,,APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI,Appl.

Participants first underwent fear conditioning during which they were exposed to a large and a small circle. One of these was repeatedly paired with an electric shock (making it the CS +), whereas the other circle was never paired with the shock (the CS-). After a delay interval containing either a nap or wake, participants again viewed the CS + and the CS- intermixed with eight novel circles that varied in size between the two stimuli seen before, as well as a blue triangle that served as a novel stimulus without prior fear relevance. We examined both fear retention (the difference between the CS + and the CS-) and fear generalization (responses to the novel stimuli based on their similarity to the original CS +). Contrary to previous studies, results from the participants who acquired a differentiated fear response during the acquisition phase revealed that the wake group showed significantly larger skin conductance responses to the CS + compared to the CS-, whereas no such difference was present in the sleep group. These results were not driven by differences in explicit memory or by differences in general reactivity. Analyzing responses to the novel stimuli revealed a tendency towards a more generalized response in the sleep group, with no differences between the CS + and any other stimulus, whereas the wake group showed increased responses to the stimuli depending on their similarity to the original CS +. This effect was however only present when controlling for baseline differences in worry.","[Davidson, Per; Carlsson, Ingegerd; Johansson, Mikael] Lund Univ, Dept Psychol, Box 213, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Jonsson, Peter] Kristianstad Univ, Ctr Psychol, Sch Educ & Environm, Kristianstad, Sweden",,"Davidson, P (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Psychol, Box 213, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",per.davidson@psy.lu.se,"Jnsson, Peter/I-2059-2014; Davidson, Per/AFE-2915-2022; Johansson, Mikael/A-5338-2008","Jnsson, Peter/0000-0002-2921-3945; Davidson, Per/0000-0001-9943-9862; Johansson, Mikael/0000-0002-2903-6301",Helge Ax:son Johnson foundation,"This work was supported by a grant from the Helge Ax:son Johnson foundation.

Neural models of fear generalization suggest the involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, conflicting empirical findings complicate our understanding of the role of the mPFC in pathological anxiety. To address important unanswered questions in this area, a detailed review and synthesis of results from human and nonhuman animal investigations of conditioned fear generalization was conducted. Method: Empirical articles were identified through March 2017 and selected if they used fear conditioning, measured fear generalization, and included a measure of activity in the mPFC or manipulation of mPFC functioning. Results: In human cued fear conditioning, the ventral mPFC plays an important role in the inhibition of fear generalization, whereas dorsal mPFC is important for the activation of generalized fear. This pattern remains to be further investigated in nonhuman animal models. Nonhuman animal research suggests an interaction between the neural correlates of contextual fear generalization and timing, such that the mPFC appears to increase fear generalization at remote time points and reduce generalization at recent time points following acquisition. Conclusions: The literature suggests a key role for the mPFC in fear generalization, but empirical details vary depending on specific regions within the mPFC, the animal model used, and the timing of the generalization test. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of the mPFC in fear generalization, which could in turn facilitate more effective pharmacological interventions for pathological anxiety.","[Spalding, Kelsey N.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",,"Spalding, KN (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, E11 Seashore Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",kelsey-spalding@uiowa.edu,,,,,,95,11,11,11,24,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0894-4105,1931-1559,,NEUROPSYCHOLOGY,Neuropsychology,JAN,2018,32,1,,,,,1,17,,10.1037/neu0000384,,,17,"Psychology, Clinical; Neurosciences; Psychology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology,FW1ZY,WOS:000425101200001,28857602,,,,2022-04-16,

Some of these effects involve observational learning and result in lasting changes of fear-motivated behavior. While most evidence reveals increased fearfulness after observation of fearful demonstrators (models) in a number of species, a few reports from human and non-human primates indicate that observational learning can also attenuate some forms of fear. In the present study, we set out to determine the effects of social modeling and observational learning on fear conditioning in the mouse. Observers were pre-exposed to a novel context in the presence of fearful (F group) or non-fearful (NF group) demonstrators. Mice of the F group acquired control levels of conditioned fear. On the other hand, mice of the NF group exhibited profound and persistent reduction of fear. The decrease of fear in NF observers was most likely due to context-specific impairments of fear conditioning, as revealed by selective effects on long- but not short-term contextual fear memory, and normal fear conditioning in response to a novel context or cue. The effect was lasting, but constrained by the shock intensity. Attenuation of fear conditioning resulting from interactions with non-fearful conspecifics was largely, but not entirely, mediated by vicarious learning. These findings identify an important social buffering process serving to prevent a lasting induction of fear in response to isolated, moderately intense stressful events. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, extinction does not erase fear, as an extinguished cue presented in a context distinct from that of extinction results in renewed fear of that cue. The hippocampus, which is involved in the formation of contextual representations, is a natural candidate structure for investigations into the neural circuitry underlying fear renewal. Thus far, studies examining the necessity of the hippocampus for fear renewal have produced mixed results. We isolated the conditions under which the hippocampus may be required for renewal. Rats received lesions of the dorsal hippocampus either prior to tone fear conditioning or following extinction. Fear renewal was measured using discrete tone presentations or a long, continuous tone. The topography of fear responding at test was assessed by comparing early and sustained renewal, where early fear was determined by freezing to the first discrete tone or the equivalent initial segment of a continuous tone and sustained fear was determined by freezing averaged across all discrete tones or the entire continuous tone. We found that following pretraining damage of the hippocampus, early renewal remained intact regardless of lesion condition. However, sustained renewal only persisted in discrete, but not continuous, tone-tested animals. A more extensive analysis of the topography of fear responding revealed that the disruption of renewal was generated when the tone duration at test began to violate that used during extinction, suggesting that the hippocampus is sensitive to mismatches in CS-duration. Postextinction lesions resulted in an overall reduction of fear renewal. This pattern of results is consistent with those observed for contextual fear conditioning, wherein animals display a resistance to anterograde amnesia despite the presence of a strong retrograde amnesia for the same contextual information. Furthermore, the data support a role for the hippocampus in sustaining renewal when the CS duration at test does not match that used during extinction.

Researchers have identified demographic factors associated with poorer fear learning and explored the use of different fear conditioning paradigms across various populations. However, few studies have strategically aimed to enhance acquisition by manipulating the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In the current manuscript, we examined whether demographic factors predicted failure to condition (n = 274) and explored whether modifications to the UCS enhanced fear learning (n = 143). Results indicated that race, but not age, education, or gender, predicted failure to condition. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that race was the most influential of these predictors; African Americans were less likely to acquire a conditioned SCR, compared to non-African Americans. Also, use of a compound UCS (i.e., electric shock combined with a scream noise) led to nearly double the rate of acquisition of a conditioned SCR. Hence, use of a compound UCS may provide a way to reduce the number of excluded individuals in studies of fear conditioned SCR and thereby improve the representativeness of research samples.","[Kredlow, M.

Studies indicate that cat odor and trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a synthetic compound isolated from fox feces, are often presented to rodents to induce fear-related responses including freezing, avoidance, stress hormone and, in some tests, risk assessment behavior. Furthermore, we report that different amounts of cat odor impregnated on small-, medium-, or large-sized cloths impact the display of fear-related behavior when presented to rats. That is, rats exposed to a large cat odor containing cloth exhibit an increase in fear behavior, particularly freezing, which remains at high levels in habituation tests administered over a period of 7 days. The large cloth also induces a long-lasting increase in avoidance behavior during repeated habituation and extinction tests. A review of the brain regions involved in predator odor-induced fear behavior indicates a modulatory role of the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and dorsal premammillary nucleus. In addition, the basolateral amygdala is involved in fear behavior induced by cat odor but not TMT, and the central amygdala does not appear to play a major behavioral role in predator odor-induced fear. Future research involving the use of predator odor is likely to rapidly expand knowledge on the neurobiology of fear, which has implications for understanding fear-related psychopathology.

However, the relationship between orexin A and extinction memory remains unclear. To investigate the effect of orexin A on extinction memory in humans, we recruited 43 male subjects and divided them into a recent group and remote group. After acquiring Pavlovian fear conditioning, individuals in recent group experienced fear extinction 24 h after acquisition, and remote group underwent extinction 2 weeks later. Meanwhile, plasma orexin A levels before extinction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both groups received memory test 24 h after fear extinction. The results showed that both recent and remote groups successfully acquired fear conditioning and had spontaneous recovery at test. In particular, the correlational analysis indicated that orexin A levels before extinction were negatively associated with fear responses during test only in recent group, but not in remote group. Moreover, individuals with high orexin A levels still kept low fear responses after extinction in recent group by subgroup analyses. The results suggest that orexin A could influence the retention of recent fear memory extinction, without affecting remote fear extinction. These findings remind us the orexin system can be a potential treatment target for fear-related disorders, and the mechanisms of recent and remote fear extinction may be different.","[Shi, Le; Khan, Muhammad Z.; Liu, Jiajia] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Le; Han, Ying; Khan, Muhammad Z.; Liu, Jiajia; Bao, Yanping; Lu, Lin; Shi, Jie] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Le; Han, Ying; Khan, Muhammad Z.; Liu, Jiajia; Bao, Yanping; Lu, Lin; Shi, Jie] Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Drug Dependence Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenhao; Deng, Jiahui; Chen, Sijing; Que, Jianyu; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Hosp 6, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Minist Hlth,Key Lab Mental Hlth,Inst Mental Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Lu, L; Shi, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lu, L; Shi, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Drug Dependence Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Hosp 6, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Minist Hlth,Key Lab Mental Hlth,Inst Mental Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",linlu@bjmu.edu.cn; shijie@bjmu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230033, 91432303, 81521063, 8160050380]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31230033, 91432303, 81521063, and 8160050380).",,45,7,8,2,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-453X,,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

People reported the most fear of the two largest and most dangerous carnivores, brown bears and wolves, and less fear of lynx and wolverines. Women expressed significantly more fear of these species than did men, and expressed fear increased with age in both sexes. Human population density had very little effect on the degree of self-reported fear of large carnivores, but people living in rural areas with one carnivore species in their vicinity expressed less fear of this species than people from rural areas where this carnivore species was absent. Activities related to experience with, or knowledge of, the large carnivores also effected fear patterns. People with higher education and those who expressed interest in outdoor activities like small game hunting and mountain hiking generally reported less fear than did respondents with lower education and no interest in outdoor activities, respectively. We argue that a good management strategy is to develop educational programs where people learn about the biology and habits of the large carnivores and are encouraged to gain first-hand outdoor experience in areas with large carnivores (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

This phenomenon, called occasion setting, is central to modulation-based Pavlovian learning. We conducted two experiments with humans in fear and appetitive conditioning paradigms, training stimuli in differential conditioning, feature-positive discriminations, and feature-negative discriminations. We also investigated the effects of trait anxiety and trait depression on these forms of learning. Results from both experiments showed that participants were able to successfully learn which stimuli predicted the electric shock and monetary reward outcomes. Additionally, as hypothesized, the stimuli trained as occasion setters had little-to-no effect on simple reinforced or non-reinforced stimuli, suggesting the former were indeed occasion setters. Lastly, in fear conditioning, trait anxiety was associated with increases in fear of occasion setter/conditional stimulus compounds; in appetitive conditioning, trait depression was associated with lower expectations of monetary reward for the trained negative occasion setting compound and transfer of the negative occasion setter to the simple reinforced stimulus. These results suggest that clinically anxious individuals may have enhanced fear of occasion setting compounds, and clinically depressed individuals may expect less reward with compounds involving the negative occasion setter.","[Zbozinek, Tomislav D.; Wise, Toby; Perez, Omar D.; Mobbs, Dean] CALTECH, Humanities & Social Sci, 1200 E Calif Blvd,MC 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Perez, Omar D.] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Fac Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Qi, Song] NIMH, 6001 Execut Blvd,Room 6200,MSC 9663, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 502 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA",,"Zbozinek, TD (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, 1200 E Calif Blvd,MC 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",zbozinek@caltech.edu,,"Qi, Song/0000-0002-5886-849X; Perez Riveros, Omar David/0000-0002-4168-5435",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1911441],"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1911441 granted to Tomislav Zbozinek, PhD under the supervision of Dean Mobbs, PhD and Michael Fanselow, PhD.

At first glance this view appears to be inconsistent with one based on biological significance, in which fear is regarded as an adaptive state with fear behaviour functioning to protect the animal from injury. Fear is often adaptive in ideal circumstances but neither we nor the animals in our care live in an ideal world. In reality, many farming systems prevent the animals from responding in an adaptive fashion to potentially threatening stimuli. In these circumstances, fear can be a powerful and potentially damaging stressor, particularly if it is intense or persistent. Both acute and chronic fear can seriously harm the welfare and performance of poultry. Certain fear responses, such as violent escape or panic, are inappropriate in intensive systems and can cause injury, pain or even the death of birds. High levels of underlying fearfulness have also been negatively associated with plumage condition, egg production, egg shell quality, growth, and food conversion efficiency. Furthermore, because fear inhibits all other motivational systems, its elicitation is likely to impair the ability of birds to adapt to environmental change, to interact successfully with each other or with the stock person, and to utilize new resources. Therefore, high fear is clearly undesirable from the bird's and the farmer's viewpoint and its reduction is of major importance. This objective had been hampered because of the complexity of the concept of fear and the controversy over its measurement. However, operational definitions of fear and its components are given in this review and a number of tests which have been used to measure fear in poultry are described. Strong intra-individual correlations found between the fear scores afforded in many of these tests suggested that they are measuring the same intervening variable, presumably underlying fearfulness, rather than purely stimulus-specific responses. Two of the commonest and potentially most frightening events encountered by poultry are sudden changes in their physical or social environment and exposure to humans. Other more specific types of alarming stimuli are also listed. Hitherto, the most promising ways of reducing underlying fearfulness and increasing adaptability, at least in the laboratory, involve one or more of the following approaches: environmental enrichment, regular handling or related treatments, vitamin C supplementation of the diet or drinking water, and genetic selection. The potential benefits and shortcomings of these remedial measures are discussed, with attention to their practical relevance as well as to their more fundamental implications. Other measures to mask and/or minimize the incidence of frightening events are also briefly mentioned. Our objective should be not only to achieve a balance between maintaining an emotional state that facilitates the avoidance of danger while reducing the likelihood of overreaction and the expression of inappropriate responses, but also to provide a stimulating, safe but economically viable environment. Continued investigation should enable recommendations to be made concerning the most effective programme, in terms of environmental modification, human-animal interaction, nutritive manipulation, and selective breeding, in order to achieve the optimal levels of fear in poultry, whatever the future trends in the industry.",,,"Jones, RB (corresponding author), ROSLIN INST, DIV ENVIRONM & WELFARE, ROSLIN EH25 9PS, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,278,344,349,2,138,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0043-9339,1743-4777,,WORLD POULTRY SCI J,Worlds Poult.

However, extinction memories are prone to relapse. For example, fear is likely to return when a prolonged time period intervenes between extinction and a subsequent encounter with the fear provoking stimulus (spontaneous recovery). Therefore there is considerable interest in the development of procedures that strengthen extinction and to prevent such recovery of fear. We contrasted two procedures in rats that have been reported to cause such deepened extinction. One where extinction begins before the initial consolidation of fear memory begins (immediate extinction) and another where extinction begins after a brief exposure to the consolidated fear stimulus. The latter is thought to open a period of memory vulnerability similar to that which occurs during initial consolidation (reconsolidation update). We also included a standard extinction treatment and a control procedure that reversed the brief exposure and extinction phases. Spontaneous recovery was only found with the standard extinction treatment. In a separate experiment we tested fear shortly after extinction (i.e., within 6 h). All extinction procedures, except reconsolidation update reduced fear at this short-term test. The findings suggest that strengthened extinction can result from alteration in both retrieval and consolidation processes.","[Ponnusamy, Ravikumar; Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",,"Ponnusamy, R; Fanselow, MS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA.",rponnusamy@gmail.com; fanselow@ucla.edu,,,NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [RO1-MH62122]; Staglin Center for Brain and Behavioral Health; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062122] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Supported by NIMH Grant RO1-MH62122 and the Staglin Center for Brain and Behavioral Health to MSF.,,35,18,18,1,24,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Concentration data from multiple exposure scenarios tested in a study by Stabler et al. (2008) were compared to human toxicity benchmarks to calculate hazard quotients. For the no clean-up scenario, hazard quotients were generally less than 1, suggesting an unlikely health risk. When the room was ventilated and the broken CFL was cleaned-up, mercury concentrations were generally lower. A review of release scenarios, along with duration-adjusted toxicity benchmarks, indicated that few releases produced levels of concern, but some scenarios resulted in exceedance of risk targets and require further study. Uncertainties in this screening characterization include assumptions about room size, ventilation, age of lamp, the distribution of mercury in the room, and also the choice of the toxicity benchmarks used to develop the hazard quotients.

Here, we investigated the role of sleep and sleep deprivation on the consolidation of fear memories and underlying neuronal mechanisms. We employed a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm either followed by a night of polysomnographically monitored sleep, or wakefulness in forty healthy participants. Recall of learned fear was better after sleep, as indicated by stronger explicitly perceived anxiety and autonomous nervous responses. These effects were positively correlated with the preceding time spent in REM sleep and paralleled by activation of the basolateral amygdala. These findings suggest REM sleep-associated consolidation of fear memory in the human amygdala. In view of the critical participation of fear learning mechanisms in the etiology of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, deprivation of REM sleep after exposure to distressing events is an interesting target for further investigation.

Here we assessed return of fear of public speaking, and whether either of two types of ECs can attenuate it. Participants gave speeches of increasing difficulty during an exposure practice session and were tested 2 days later in a different context. Testing occurred in the presence of physical ECs, after mentally rehearsing the exposure session, or without either reminder. Practice reduced fear of public speaking, but fear partially returned at test. Neither physical nor mental ECs reduced partial return of fear of public speaking.

Arguments for restricting research typically have a slippery-slope structure: Researching A will lead to deployment; we have decisive moral reasons against deployment; therefore, we should not research A. However, scientific uncertainty makes it difficult to prove or disprove the conclusion of slippery-slope arguments. This article accepts this indeterminacy and asks whether and when it would be permissible to restrict research under empirical and normative uncertainty. The argument starts from the ethical framework for the regulation of scientific research with human subjects and offers modifications to adapt it to the purpose of restricting new technologies. Two main questions arise in the process: whether it is permissible to impose restrictions at the research stage to prevent harms that will arise from the use of a technology and whether it is permissible to restrict research preemptively on the grounds of public fear and anxiety, before there is sufficient evidence establishing the risk of harm. I answer both questions in the affirmative and defend this position against objections.","[Pamuk, Zeynep] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Pamuk, Z (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",zpamuk@ucsd.edu,,"Pamuk, Zeynep/0000-0003-0057-0495",,,,59,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0264-3758,1468-5930,,J APPL PHILOS,J.

This experiment examines variation in US expectancy (i.e., expectancy violation) as a predictor of long-term extinction retention. It also examines within-session habituation of fear-potentiated startle (electromyography, EMG) and fear of conditioned stimuli (CS) throughout extinction training as predictors of extinction retention. Participants (n=63) underwent fear conditioning, extinction and retention and provided continuous ratings of US expectancy and EMG, as well as CS fear ratings before and after each phase. Variation in US expectancy throughout extinction and habituation of EMG and fear was entered into a regression as predictors of retention and reinstatement of levels of expectancy and fear. Greater variation in US expectancy throughout extinction training was significantly predictive of enhanced extinction performance measured at retention test, although not after reinstatement test. Slope of EMG and CS fear during extinction did not predict retention of extinction. Within-session habituation of EMG and self-reported fear is not sufficient for long-term retention of extinction learning, and models emphasizing expectation violation may result in enhanced outcomes.","[Brown, Lily A.; LeBeau, Richard T.; Craske, Michelle G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [LeBeau, Richard T.] VA West Los Angeles Med Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Chat, Ka Yi] Boston Univ, Dept Psychol, 64 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Craske, MG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",craske@psych.ucla.edu,"LeBeau, Richard/R-2354-2017","LeBeau, Richard/0000-0002-6866-9793; Chat, Ka-Yi/0000-0003-2448-5877",,,,42,15,15,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

In many studies the CS and UCS are paired on every trial, whereas in others the CS and UCS are paired intermittently. To better understand the influence of the CS-UCS pairing rate on brain activity, the experimenters presented continuously, intermittently, and non-paired CSs during fear conditioning. Amygdala, anterior cingulate, and fusiform gyrus activity increased linearly with the CS-UCS pairing rate. In contrast, insula and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses were larger during intermittently paired CS presentations relative to continuously and non-paired CSs. These results demonstrate two distinct patterns of activity in disparate brain regions. Amygdala, anterior cingulate, and fusiform gyros activity paralleled the CS-UCS pairing rate, whereas the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex appeared to respond to the uncertainty inherent in intermittent CS-UCS pairing procedures.

However, due to ethical and methodological limitations, few studies have examined these learning processes across development, particularly among anxious individuals. The present study examined differences in fear conditioning and extinction in anxious and nonanxious youth and adults using a novel task designed to be more tolerable for children than existing paradigms. MethodsTwenty-two anxious adults, 15 anxious youth, 30 healthy adults, and 17 healthy youth completed two discriminative fear-conditioning tasks. A well-validated task paired a woman's fearful face with a scream as the unconditioned stimulus. The novel task paired a bell with an aversive alarm as the unconditioned stimulus. Self-reported fear, skin conductance response, and fear-potentiated startle eye blink were measured. ResultsBoth tasks were well tolerated and elicited fear responses with moderate stability. Anxious youth and adults reported overall greater fear than healthy participants during the tasks, although no group differences occurred in discriminative fear conditioning or extinction, as assessed by self-report or physiology. ConclusionThe novel bell-conditioning task is potent in eliciting fear responses but tolerable for pediatric and anxious populations. Our findings are consistent with prior studies that have shown comparable fear learning processes in anxious and nonanxious youth, but dissimilar from studies exhibiting between-group differences in extinction. Given the limited research on fear conditioning in youth, methodological issues and suggestions for future work are discussed.","[Shechner, Tomer] Univ Haifa, Dept Psychol, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Britton, Jennifer C.] Univ Miami, Dept Psychol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Ronkin, Emily G.; Jarcho, Johanna M.; Mash, Jamie A.; Michalska, Kalina J.; Pine, Daniel S.] NIMH, Sect Dev & Affect Neurosci, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Leibenluft, Ellen] NIMH, Sect Bipolar Disorder, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Shechner, T (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Psychol, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.",tshechner@psy.haifa.ac.il,"Jarcho, Johanna/N-8862-2017; Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019","Jarcho, Johanna/0000-0001-9075-6968; ","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Marie Curie Career Integration Grant; Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [ISF-1377/14]; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R00-091183]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R00MH091183, ZIAMH002781] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Contract grant sponsor: Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health; Contract grant sponsor: Marie Curie Career Integration Grant and Israel Science Foundation ISF-1377/14 (TS); Contract grant sponsor: National Institute of Mental Health R00-091183 (JCB).",,27,49,48,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1091-4269,1520-6394,,DEPRESS ANXIETY,Depress.

During reconsolidation, stored information is rendered labile after being retrieved. Pharmacological manipulations at this stage result in an inability to retrieve the memories at later times, suggesting that they are erased or persistently inhibited. Unfortunately, the use of these pharmacological manipulations in humans can be problematic. Here we introduce a non-invasive technique to target the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans. We provide evidence that old fear memories can be updated with non-fearful information provided during the reconsolidation window. As a consequence, fear responses are no longer expressed, an effect that lasted at least a year and was selective only to reactivated memories without affecting others. These findings demonstrate the adaptive role of reconsolidation as a window of opportunity to rewrite emotional memories, and suggest a non-invasive technique that can be used safely in humans to prevent the return of fear.","[Schiller, Daniela; Monfils, Marie-H.; LeDoux, Joseph E.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Schiller, Daniela; Raio, Candace M.; Johnson, David C.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Monfils, Marie-H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Phelps, EA (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",liz.phelps@nyu.edu,"Monfils, Marie/F-1282-2013; Schiller, Daniela/Q-2431-2018","Schiller, Daniela/0000-0002-0357-7724; Monfils, Marie-H./0000-0001-8971-6651","James S.

Propranolol administration during CS retrieval-induced reconsolidation can impair fear memory that is specific to the reactivated CS. However, from a practical perspective, the US is often associated with multiple CSs, and each CS can induce a fear response. The present study sought to develop and test a US-based memory retrieval interference procedure with propranolol to disrupt the original fear memory and eliminate all CS-associated fear responses in humans. We recruited 127 young healthy volunteers and conducted three experiments. All of the subjects acquired fear conditioning, after which they received the beta -adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (40mg) or placebo (vitamin C) and were exposed to the US or CS to reactivate the original fear memory. Fear responses were measured. Oral propranolol administration 1h before US retrieval significantly decreased subsequent fear responses and disrupted associations between all CSs and the US. However, propranolol administration before CS retrieval only inhibited the fear memory that was related to the reactivated CS. Moreover, the propranolol-induced inhibition of fear memory reconsolidation that was retrieved by the US had a relatively long-lasting effect (at least 2 weeks) and was also effective for remote fear memory. These findings indicate that the US-based memory retrieval interference procedure with propranolol can permanently decrease the fear response and prevent the return of fear for all CSs in humans. This procedure may open new avenues for treating fear-related disorders.","[Deng, Jiahui; Shi, Le; Yuan, Kai; Que, Jianyu; Gong, Yimiao; Sun, Hongqiang; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Chinese Acad Med Sci, Hosp 6,NHC Key Lab Mental Hlth,Res Unit 2018RU006, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders,Inst Mental Hl, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Ping] Inner Mongolia Med Univ, Basic Med Coll, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Chen, Sijing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Bao, Yanping; Shi, Jie; Han, Ying; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bao, Yanping; Shi, Jie; Han, Ying; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Drug Dependence Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Sun, HQ; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Chinese Acad Med Sci, Hosp 6,NHC Key Lab Mental Hlth,Res Unit 2018RU006, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders,Inst Mental Hl, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Han, Y; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Han, Y; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Drug Dependence Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yinghan@bjmu.edu.cn; sunhq@bjmu.edu.cn; linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,,,"Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [7194336]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology CommissionBeijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z181100001718051]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0706204]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81600925, 81821092, 81701312]","This work was supported in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (no. 7194336), Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (no.

Post-training lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala completely blocked both contextual freezing and fear-potentiated startle. Post-training lesions of the dorsal hippocampus attenuated contextual freezing, consistent with previous reports in the literature; however, these same lesions had no effect on fear-potentiated startle, suggesting preserved contextual fear.

Fear conditioning involves the amygdala as the main neural structure for learning fear responses whereas fear extinction mainly activates the inhibitory prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study we investigated whether individual differences in trait anxiety affect amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during fear conditioning and extinction. Method. Thirty-two healthy subjects were investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 T while performing a cued fear-conditioning task. All participants completed the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T). Activations of the amygdala and the dACC were examined with respect to the effects of trait anxiety. Results. Analysis of the fMRI data demonstrated enhanced activation in fear-related brain areas, such as the insula and the ACC, during both fear conditioning and extinction. Activation of the amygdala appeared only during the late acquisition phase whereas deactivation was observed during extinction. Regression analyses revealed that highly trait-anxious subjects exhibited sustained amygdala activation and reduced dACC involvement during the extinction of conditioned responses. Conclusions. This study reveals that high levels of trait anxiety are associated with both increased amygdala activation and reduced dACC recruitment during the extinction of conditioned fear. This hyper-responsitivity of the amygdala and the deficient cognitive control during the extinction of conditioned fear in anxious subjects reflect an increased resistance to extinct fear responses and may thereby enhance the vulnerability to developing anxiety disorders.","[Sehlmeyer, C.; Dannlowski, U.; Schoening, S.; Pyka, M.; Arolt, V.; Konrad, C.] Univ Hosp Muenster, Dept Psychiat, Munster, Germany; [Schoening, S.; Konrad, C.] Univ Hosp Muenster, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res, Munster, Germany; [Kugel, H.; Pfleiderer, B.; Schiffbauer, H.; Heindel, W.] Univ Hosp Muenster, Dept Clin Radiol, Munster, Germany; [Zwitserlood, P.] Univ Munster, Dept Psychol, Munster, Germany; [Schiffbauer, H.] Univ Hosp Bonn, Dept Radiol, Bonn, Germany; [Konrad, C.] Univ Marburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-35039 Marburg, Germany",,"Konrad, C (corresponding author), Univ Marburg, Dept Psychiat, Rudolf Bultmann Str 8, D-35039 Marburg, Germany.",Carsten.Konrad@med.uni-marburg.de,"Kugel, Harald/A-4963-2013","Kugel, Harald/0000-0002-4349-1984; Dannlowski, Udo/0000-0002-0623-3759","Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research of the University of Muenster, Germany (IZKF); German Ministry of Science (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, BMBF Paniknetz); University of Muenster","This work was supported by a young investigator grant to C.K. by the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research of the University of Muenster, Germany (IZKF).

The present study sought to confirm whether the MMN is affected by classical fear conditioning in healthy participants. MMN amplitude, N1 amplitude, and skin conductance level (SCL) in 20 healthy volunteers during a fear-conditioning paradigm consisting of three phases (habituation, fear acquisition, and fear extinction) were recorded. Red and blue light signals were presented as the conditioned stimuli CS+ (threat cue) and CS- (safety cue), respectively. In addition, an aversive electrical stimulus was delivered as the unconditioned stimulus with CS+ in the fear-acquisition phase. No MMN amplitude changes were observed between the CS types during the three phases. In the acquisition phase, the mean SCL during CS+ was significantly higher than that during CS-. The MMN amplitude and deviant N1 amplitude in the extinction phase were significantly lower than those in the other phases regardless of the CS type. Despite the clear alteration of SCL between CS types in the acquisition phase, no significant differences in MMN were observed. Decreased MMN and deviant N1 in the fear-extinction phase were considered to be mainly due to decreased arousal or attention level. Results indicate that the auditory MMN amplitude was not affected by the cognitive process of fear recognized by other sense modalities.","[Kurayama, Taichi] Uekusa Gakuen Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Therapy, Chiba, Japan; [Matsuzawa, Daisuke; Shimizu, Eiji] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cognit Behav Physiol, Chiba, Japan; [Matsuzawa, Daisuke; Hirano, Yoshiyuki; Shimizu, Eiji] Chiba Univ, Res Ctr Child Mental Dev, Chiba, Japan",,"Kurayama, T (corresponding author), 1639-3 Oguracho,Wakabaku, Chiba 2640007, Japan.",t-kurayama@uekusa.ac.jp,"HIRANO, YOSHIYUKI/L-1234-2017; Kurayama, Taichi/V-8171-2019","HIRANO, YOSHIYUKI/0000-0003-3844-3061; ",,,,25,0,0,1,11,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0959-4965,1473-558X,,NEUROREPORT,Neuroreport,MAY 1,2019,30,7,,,,,468,472,,10.1097/WNR.0000000000001221,,,5,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,HV5BL,WOS:000465999300002,30817683,,,,2022-04-16,

Study design and outcome measures: A total of 235 women (69.21 +/- 7.56 years) participated in this study. Body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis), hand-grip strength, and physical performance (gait speed) were evaluated for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, obesity, and SO. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) and the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) were employed to assess FoF and balance confidence, respectively. Scores of >26 on the FES-I and <67% on the ABC were used to identify women at risk of falling. The independent associations of sarcopenia, obesity and SO with FoF, balance confidence, and fall risk were evaluated by multivariate linear and logistic regressions, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results: 27.23% and 18.72% of women presented with sarcopenia and SO, respectively. Gait speed, body mass index (BMI), and fall history were independently associated with ABC score (adjusted-R-2 = 0.152) and fall risk (ABC) (adjusted-R-2 = 0.115). FES-I score was independently associated (adjusted-R-2 = 0.193) with fall history, gait speed, BMI, and depression, which, together with obesity (BMI) and SO, remained independent factors for fall risk measured as FES-I score (adjusted-R-2 = 0.243). Conclusion: In community-dwelling middle-aged and older Spanish women, BMI, gait speed, and fall history were independently associated with FoF, balance confidence, and fall risk. Depression was related only to FoF, and, together with obesity (BMI) and SO, was an independent predictor of fall risk as assessed by the FES-I.","[Aibar-Almazan, Agustin; Martinez-Amat, Antonio; Cruz-Diaz, David; Jimenez-Garcia, Jose D.; Achalandabaso, Alexander; Hita-Contreras, Fidel] Univ Jaen, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Sci, E-23071 Jaen, Spain; [Sanchez-Montesinos, Indalecio] Univ Granada, Dept Human Anat & Embryol, Sch Med, Granada, Spain; [de la Torre-Cruz, Manuel] Univ Jaen, Dept Psychol, Jaen, Spain",,"Hita-Contreras, F (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Sci, E-23071 Jaen, Spain.",fhita@ujaen.es,"Martnez-Amat, Antonio/S-2156-2019; De la Torre Cruz, Manuel Jess/G-6130-2011; Cruz-Diaz, David/AAI-5893-2020; Achalandabaso, Alexander/K-7337-2018; ALMAZAN, AGUSTIN AIBAR/AAM-9109-2020; Martnez-Amat, Antonio/M-6062-2015; GARCA, JOS DANIEL JIMNEZ/AAB-4059-2020; Contreras, Fidel Hita/H-8170-2015","Martnez-Amat, Antonio/0000-0002-9652-791X; De la Torre Cruz, Manuel Jess/0000-0002-8355-7239; Cruz-Diaz, David/0000-0001-5070-0679; Achalandabaso, Alexander/0000-0003-1989-2988; Martnez-Amat, Antonio/0000-0002-9652-791X; GARCA, JOS DANIEL JIMNEZ/0000-0002-4219-3993; Contreras, Fidel Hita/0000-0001-7215-5456; Aibar Almazan, Agustin/0000-0002-9386-9199",,,,48,27,29,0,18,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0378-5122,1873-4111,,MATURITAS,Maturitas,JAN,2018,107,,,,,,26,32,,10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.10.001,,,7,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Obstetrics & Gynecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geriatrics & Gerontology; Obstetrics & Gynecology,FR3RC,WOS:000418982900007,29169576,,,,2022-04-16,

The enrichment factor, coefficient variation, and potential ecological risk index were used to assess the pollution and eco-risk level of heavy metals, among which, Cd and Hg showed higher pollution levels and potential risks than the others in the studied area. Moreover, multivariate geostatistical analysis suggested that Hg originated mainly from point sources such as industrial emissions, while agricultural activity is the predominant factor for Cd. The human health risk assessment indicated that non-carcinogenic values were below the threshold values. The total carcinogenic risks due to As, Cr, and Ni were within the acceptable range for adults, while for children, they were higher than the threshold value (1.0E-04), indicating that children are facing higher threat to heavy metals in soils.

Recent experimental data show that associative learning processes are involved in the acquisition of pain-related fear. An intriguing yet underinvestigated question entails how spreading of pain-related fear in chronic pain occurs. In a voluntary movement paradigm in which one arm movement (CS+) was followed by a painful stimulus and another was not (CS-) in the predictable group and painful stimuli were delivered during the intertrial interval (context alone) in the unpredictable group, we tested generalization of fear to six novel generalization movements (GSs) with varying levels of similarity between the original CS+ movement and CS- movement. Healthy participants (N = 58) were randomly assigned to the predictable or unpredictable group. Fear was measured via verbal ratings and eyeblink startle responses. Results indicated that cued pain-related fear spreads selectively to novel movements that are proprioceptively more similar to the CS+ than to those similar to the CS- in the predictable group, but not in the unpredictable group. This is the first study to demonstrate a generalization gradient of cued pain-related fear. However, this effect was only present in the startle eyeblink responses, but not in the verbal ratings. Taken together, this paradigm represents a novel tool to scrutinize the largely understudied phenomenon of the spreading of fear and avoidance in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and mapping possible pathological differences in generalization gradients and the spreading of pain in patients as compared with healthy controls.","[Meulders, Ann; Vandebroek, Nele; Vervliet, Bram; Vlaeyen, Johan W.

Learned fear responses are acquired either through direct experiences or indirectly through social transmission. Social fear learning (SFL), also known as vicarious fear learning, is a paradigm successfully used for studying the transmission of threat information between individuals. Animal and human studies have begun to elucidate the behavioral, neural and molecular mechanisms of SFL. Recent research suggests that social learning mechanisms underlie a wide range of adaptive and maladaptive phenomena, from supporting flexible avoidance in dynamic environments to intergenerational transmission of trauma and anxiety disorders. This review discusses recent advances in SFL studies and their implications for basic, social and clinical sciences.","[Debiec, Jacek] Univ Michigan, Mol & Behav Neurosci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Debiec, Jacek] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Olsson, Andreas] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Debiec, J (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Mol & Behav Neurosci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Debiec, J (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Olsson, A (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden.",jdebiec@umich.edu; andreas.olsson@ki.se,,,NARSAD Young Investigator Award from the Brain & Behavior Research FoundationNARSAD [K08 MH104743-01A1]; Todd Ouida Clinical Scholar Award in Childhood Anxiety Depression; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [KAW 2014.0237]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [284366]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K08MH104743] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by K08 MH104743-01A1, NARSAD Young Investigator Award from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation and Todd Ouida Clinical Scholar Award in Childhood Anxiety & Depression to JD, and Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW 2014.0237) and an Independent Starting Grant (284366; Emotional Learning in Social Interaction project) from the European Research Council to AO.",,93,65,67,3,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",1364-6613,1879-307X,,TRENDS COGN SCI,TRENDS COGN.

However, HCTs for COVID-19 pose ethical and practical challenges, in part due to the unclear and developing risks. In this article , we introduce an interactive model for exploring some risks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) dosing study, a prerequisite for any COVID-19 challenge trials. The risk estimates we use are based on a Bayesian evidence synthesis model which can incorporate new data on infection fatality risks (IFRs) to patients, and infer rates of hospitalization. The model estimates individual risk, which we then extrapolate to overall mortality and hospitalization risk in a dosing study. We provide a web tool to explore risk under different study designs. Based on the Bayesian model, IFR for someone between 20 and 30 years of age is 15.1 in 100,000, with a 95% uncertainty interval from 11.8 to 19.2, while risk of hospitalization is 130 per 100,000 (100-160). However, risk will be reduced in an HCT via screening for comorbidities, selecting lower-risk population, and providing treatment. Accounting for this with stronger assumptions, we project the fatality risk to be as low as 2.5 per 100,000 (1.6-3.9) and the hospitalization risk to be 22.0 per 100,000 (14.0-33.7). We therefore find a 50-person dosing trial has a 99.74% (99.8-99.9%) chance of no fatalities, and a 98.9% (98.3-99.3%) probability of no cases requiring hospitalization.","[Manheim, David; Wiecek, Witold; Schmit, Virginia; Morrison, Josh] 1DaySooner, Wilmington, DE USA; [Manheim, David] Univ Haifa, Hlth & Risk Commun Res Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Haifa, Israel; [Wiecek, Witold] WAW Stat Consulting Ltd, London, England",,"Manheim, D (corresponding author), 1DaySooner, Wilmington, DE USA.; Manheim, D (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Hlth & Risk Commun Res Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Haifa, Israel.; Manheim, D (corresponding author), 8734 First Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",davidmanheim@gmail.com,,"Schmit, Virginia/0000-0002-9894-0505; Manheim, David/0000-0001-8599-8380",,,,49,4,4,4,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,MAY,2021,41,5,,,SI,,710,720,,10.1111/risa.13726,,MAY 2021,11,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",SD2OW,WOS:000646467700001,33942351,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2022-04-16,

One approach to improving existing psychological treatments for anxiety has been to develop pharmacological agents that can be used to enhance the processes underlying exposure therapy, which is the most commonly used and empirically validated psychological treatment for anxiety during which individuals are taught to appropriately inhibit fear. Animal models of exposure therapy, particularly fear extinction, have proved to be a very useful way of examining the neural and molecular correlates of fear inhibition, which has in turn led to the identification of numerous drugs that enhance these processes in rats. Several of these drugs have subsequently been tested as novel pharmacological adjuncts to exposure therapy in humans with a range of anxiety disorders. The purpose of this review is to outline the key animal models of exposure therapy and to describe how these have been used to develop potential pharmacological adjuncts for anxiety disorders.

For instance, according to Luke's Gospel, Jesus commanded fear of God, but he also evidently commanded 'Do not be afraid' in relation to God. To block inconsistency, this article clarifies two kinds of motivational fear of God: conforming fear and nonconforming fear relative to God's will. It explains why conforming, obedient fear of God, even when combined with felt abandonment by God, need not yield despair about God's reality or goodness. The article avoids two influential extremes: treating fear of God as experiencing an 'ineffable' object that is 'wholly other' (Otto and others) and treating it as mere obedience to God (von Rad and others). It identifies a central but widely neglected role for affective distress experiences in fear of God, which indicate moral or cognitive shortcomings before God but can be empowering for obeying God and for reconciliation with God.","[Moser, Paul K.] Loyola Univ, Philosophy, Chicago, IL 60660 USA",,"Moser, PK (corresponding author), Loyola Univ, Crown Ctr, 3rd Floor,1032 West Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL 60660 USA.",pmoser@luc.edu,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0021-1400,1752-4989,,IR THEOL Q,Ir.

In this task, the conditioned stimuli (CS+/CS-) are two neutral female faces, and the unconditioned stimulus is a fearful, screaming face. The second phase of the study also included a generalization stimulus (GS): a 50% blend of the CS +/- faces. The eye-blink startle reflex was utilized to measure defensive responding. Patterns of fear learning and generalization were qualified by child age. Older children demonstrated greater fear learning (i.e., larger startle during CS+ than CS-) than younger children. In addition, older children exhibited the typical pattern of generalization observed in adults, whereas younger children did not. Finally, fear learning also related to contingency awareness; only children who correctly identified the CS+ demonstrated fear-potentiated startle to the CS+.

To date few studies have assessed the spatiotemporal trade-off between resource acquisition and avoidance of risks and human disturbance in small protected areas embedded in an urban matrix. A better understanding of the forage-safety trade-off in urban protected areas (UPA) is key to the design of evidence based approaches to deal with the ever-increasing human-wildlife impacts typical of UPA. Herein, we analyzed camera trap data to evaluate how two ungulate species trade fear for food in a 60 km(2) human-dominated UPA without natural predators. We found that wild boar (Sus scrofa) were predominantly active at night, while roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) showed a typical bimodal crepuscular activity pattern. Occupancy analysis indicated that deciduous forest and the presence of high seats for hunting played an important role in determining the space use of wild boar. For roe deer, we found indications that the presence of forest influenced space use, although the null model was retained among the top ranked models. Our results confirm that wild boar and roe deer are able to thrive in heavily human dominated landscapes characterized by intensive recreational use and hunting, such as protected areas embedded in an urban matrix.

In order to explore this issue we performed a pooled analysis of six of our studies in remitted patients with a fear/anxiety disorder who were exposed to syndrome-specific aversive stimulation under acute tryptophan depletion. We based our analysis on the hypothesis that the inconsistencies observed in the studies could be predicted by Deakin and Graeff's theory about the dual role of serotonin in responses to threats, whereby serotonin is critical to prevent fear (panic) but not anxiety. In accordance with this view, our results give support to a dissociation of the disorders traditionally grouped under fear and anxiety-related disorders in terms of different roles of serotonin in modulation of responses to aversive stimulation.

Humans may have evolved specialized neural systems for responding to fear in the absence of conscious stimulus detection. We used functional neuroimaging to establish whether the amygdala and the medial prefrontal regions to which it projects are engaged by subliminal fearful faces and whether responses to subliminal fear are distinguished from those to supraliminal fear. We also examined the time course of amygdala-medial prefrontal responses to supraliminal and subliminal fear. Stimuli were fearful and neutral baseline faces, presented under subliminal (16.7 ms and masked) or supraliminal (500 ms) conditions. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) were recorded simultaneously as an objective index of fear perception. SPM2 was used to undertake search region-of-interest (ROI) analyses for the amygdala and medial prefrontal (including anterior cingulate) cortex, and complementary whole-brain analyses. Time series data were extracted from ROIs to examine activity across early versus late phases of the experiment. SCRs and amygdala activity were enhanced in response to both subliminal and supraliminal fear perception. Time series analysis showed a trend toward greater right amygdala responses to subliminal fear, but left-sided responses to supraliminal fear. Cortically, subliminal fear was distinguished by right ventral anterior cingulate activity and supraliminal fear by dorsal anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal activity. Although subcortical amygdala activity was relatively persistent for subliminal fear, supraliminal fear showed more sustained cortical activity. The findings suggest that preverbal processing of fear may occur via a direct rostral-ventral amygdala pathway without the need for conscious surveillance, whereas elaboration of consciously attended signals of fear may rely on higher-order processing within a dorsal cortico-amygdala pathway.","Westmead Hosp, Brain Dynam Ctr, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ New S Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Westmead Hosp, Dept Radiol, MRI Unit, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia; Brain Resource Co, Brain Resource Int Database, Ultimo, NSW, Australia",,"Williams, LM (corresponding author), Westmead Hosp, Brain Dynam Ctr, Acacia House, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia.",lea@psych.usyd.edu.au,"Bryant, Richard/AAA-6479-2019; Kemp, Andrew/C-7984-2012; Williams, Leanne M/B-4095-2012; anand, amit/A-7222-2009","Bryant, Richard/0000-0002-9607-819X; Kemp, Andrew/0000-0003-1146-3791; Liddell, Belinda/0000-0002-8036-5864",,,,51,160,166,3,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1065-9471,1097-0193,,HUM BRAIN MAPP,Hum.

As previous research suggests a prominent role of dopamine for the retention of conditioned and extinguished fear, dopaminergic gene polymorphisms may also relate to individual differences in fear stability. While the COMT Val158Met polymorphism causes individual differences in prefrontal dopamine, its associations with human long-term fear extinction are currently unknown. Here, n = 30/29/28 healthy male Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met carriers, respectively, underwent a two-day differential conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition and extinction on Day 1 and a recall test on Day 2 with recordings of EEG and ECG. Fearfulness but not neuroticism/anxiety predicted fear bradycardia (i.e., heart period slowing) during Day 1 fear acquisition while it did not affect extinction or Day 2 fear recall. In contrast, COMT Val158Met significantly modulated Day 2 fear recall as evident in fear bradycardia and Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes while it did not affect Day 1 fear or extinction learning. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that individual differences in fear bradycardia during Day 2 extinction recall depended on Day 1 extinction success. Importantly, this contingency was (a) modulated by COMT Val158Met and (b) significantly reduced in high vs. low neuroticism/anxiety. The present study indicates that (a) individual differences in dopaminergic genotypes may affect the long-term stability of fear memories and (b) fearfulness vs. neuroticism/anxiety might play distinct roles in initial fear reactions vs. long-term stability of fear memories, respectively.","[Panitz, Christian; Sperl, Matthias F.

Here, we determined whether chronic intermittent access (CIA) to alcohol during adolescence/early adulthood or during adulthood would alter or be associated with auditory-cued conditioned fear levels using an extended training fear incubation procedure. This training procedure leads to low fear soon after training that grows over one month. Rats received 6 weeks of CIA to 20% alcohol or water from PND 26-66. Ten or eleven days later, the rats began behavioral testing that included 10 sessions of tone-shock pairings. Rats then received 4 weeks of CIA exposure during the 1-month fear incubation period and were tested for conditioned fear 6 days after the end of alcohol access. We found no evidence that voluntary alcohol consumption during adolescence/early adulthood or adulthood altered fear expression. However, we found that rats that consumed more alcohol during early adulthood (PND 54-66) had lower fear than low-consumption rats on day 1 of conditioned fear training and in the day 2 and 1-month tests. This extends associations we previously found between individual differences in alcohol consumption and conditioned fear to a different fear conditioning procedure. Combined with our previous data that show that the rate of instrumental extinction is associated with both alcohol consumption and conditioned fear, these data provide further support for the generality and reliability of a pair of phenotypes that encompass a wide variety of learning traits.","[Pajser, Alisa; Limoges, Aaron; Long, Charday; Pickens, Charles L.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, 469 Bluemt Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",,"Pickens, CL (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, 469 Bluemt Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",pickens@ksu.edu,,"Pajser, Alisa/0000-0001-8439-7997",National Institute of General Medical Science of the National Institutes of Health [GM113109]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P20GM113109] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This project was supported by grant GM113109 from the National Institute of General Medical Science of the National Institutes of Health.,,67,5,5,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4328,1872-7549,,BEHAV BRAIN RES,Behav.

Overgeneralized fear is a typical symptom of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous research demonstrated that fear discrimination learning is mediated by prefrontal mechanisms. While the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subdivisions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are recognized for their excitatory and inhibitory effects on the fear circuit, respectively, the mechanisms driving fear discrimination are unidentified. To obtain insight into the mechanisms underlying context-specific fear discrimination, we investigated prefrontal neuronal ensembles representing distinct experiences associated with learning to disambiguate between dangerous and similar, but not identical, harmless stimuli. Here, we show distinct quantitative activation differences in response to conditioned and generalized fear experiences, as well as modulation of the neuronal ensembles associated with successful acquisition of context-safety contingencies. These findings suggest that prefrontal neuronal ensembles patterns code functional context-danger and context-safety relationships. The PL subdivision of the mPFC monitors context-danger associations to conditioned fear, whereas differential conditioning sparks additional ensembles associated with the inhibition of generalized fear in both the PL and IL subdivisions of the mPFC. Our data suggest that fear discrimination learning is associated with the modulation of prefrontal subpopulations in a subregion- and experience-specific fashion, and the learning of appropriate responses to conditioned and initially generalized fear experiences is driven by gradual updating and rebalancing of the prefrontal memory representations.","[Corches, Alex; Korzus, Edward] Univ Calif Riverside, Div Biomed Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Hiroto, Alex; Bailey, Tyler W.; Speigel, John H., III; Pastore, Justin; Korzus, Edward] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Psychol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Hiroto, Alex; Bailey, Tyler W.; Speigel, John H., III; Pastore, Justin; Korzus, Edward] Univ Calif Riverside, Program Neurosci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Mayford, Mark] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Korzus, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Psychol, Program Neurosci, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Korzus, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Program Biomed Sci, Dept Psychol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",edkorzus@ucr.edu,,"Mayford, Mark/0000-0002-9001-5024; Hiroto, Alex/0000-0003-3807-9634",National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [5R01MH106617]; Brain & Behavior Research Fundation Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH106617] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Mental Health5R01MH106617 (EK), the Brain & Behavior Research Fundation Award (EK).

Structural equation modelling of survey data suggests a dual pathway to self-reported fear. One path encompasses the appraisal of the environmental context operationalised as a potential wolf encounter. The second path concerns the appraisal of the social context assessed as social trust in managing authorities. The relative importance of the paths differs between the national and the regional sample, and between people in the administrative centre of the region and the regional periphery. We show that the public's fear of wolves should be addressed both at an individual level, focusing on situations with potential encounters, and at a collective level, by strengthening the trust between the public and authorities, and regional variation should be considered.","[Johansson, Maria; Pedersen, Eja] Lund Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Environm Psychol, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Sandstrom, Camilla] Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Ericsson, Goran] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Uppsala, Sweden",,"Johansson, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Environm Psychol, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",maria.johansson@mpe.lth.se,,"Sandstrom, Camilla/0000-0002-7674-6197","FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [250-2008-402, 251-2011-117]; Faculty of Forestry, SLU","This research was funded through Formas grant 250-2008-402 to Maria Johansson and 251-2011-117 to Camilla Sandstrom and via start-up grants from the Faculty of Forestry, SLU, to Goran Ericsson.",,75,9,9,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Although the symptoms of fear and anxiety are very similar, they also differ. Fear is a generally adaptive state of apprehension that begins rapidly and dissipates quickly once the threat is removed (phasic fear). Anxiety is elicited by less specific and less predictable threats, or by those that are physically or psychologically more distant. Thus, anxiety is a more long-lasting state of apprehension (sustained fear). Rodent studies suggest that phasic fear is mediated by the amygdala, which sends outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem to produce symptoms of fear. Sustained fear is also mediated by the amygdala, which releases corticotropin-releasing factor, a stress hormone that acts on receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a part of the so-called 'extended amygdala.' The amygdala and BNST send outputs to the same hypothalamic and brainstem targets to produce phasic and sustained fear, respectively. In rats, sustained fear is more sensitive to anxiolytic drugs. In humans, symptoms of clinical anxiety are better detected in sustained rather than phasic fear paradigms.

Methods: Patients (n = 108) with acute or subacute low back pain enrolled in a clinical trial comparing behavioral physical therapy interventions to classification-based physical therapy completed baseline questionnaires for Pain Catastrophizing Scale, fear-avoidance beliefs [Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ)-physical activity scale (PA), FABQ work scale], and patient-specific fear (Fear of Daily Activities Questionnaire). Clinical outcomes included pain intensity and disability measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months. A hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was used to create distinct cluster profiles among the FAM measures and discriminant analysis was used to interpret clusters. Changes in clinical outcomes were investigated with repeated measures analysis of variance and differences in results based on cluster membership were compared with FABQ-PA subgrouping used in the original trial. Results: Three distinct FAM subgroups (Low-Risk, High Specific Fear, and High Fear and Catastrophizing) emerged from cluster analysis. Subgroups differed on baseline pain and disability (P < 0.01) with the High Fear and Catastrophizing subgroup associated with greater pain than the Low-Risk subgroup (P < 0.01) and the greatest disability (P < 0.05). Subgroup X time interactions were detected for both pain and disability (P < 0.05) with the High Fear and Catastrophizing subgroup reporting greater changes in pain and disability than other subgroups (P < 0.05). In contrast, FABQ-PA subgroups used in the original trial were not associated with interactions for clinical outcomes. Discussion: These data suggest that subgrouping based on multiple FAM measures may provide additional information on clinical outcomes in comparison with determining subgroup status by FABQ-PA alone. Subgrouping methods for patients with low back pain should include multiple psychological factors to further explore if patients can be matched with appropriate interventions.","[Beneciuk, Jason M.; George, Steven Z.] Univ Florida, Dept Phys Therapy, Gainesville, FL USA; [Robinson, Michael E.] Univ Florida, Dept Clin & Hlth Psychol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Robinson, Michael E.; George, Steven Z.] Univ Florida, Ctr Pain Res & Behav Hlth, Gainesville, FL USA",,"Beneciuk, JM (corresponding author), POB 100154, Gainesville, FL 32615 USA.",beneciuk@phhp.ufl.edu,"Robinson, Michael E/B-9765-2014","George, Steven/0000-0003-4988-9421",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [HD043730]; NIH-NIAMSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS) [AR051128]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [T32HD043730] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000064] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS) [R03AR051128] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,J.M.B. received support from the National Institutes of Health T-32 Neural Plasticity Research Training Fellowship (Grant #HD043730) while preparing this manuscript.

Conditioned suppression of operant behavior by a Pavlovian threat cue is an established laboratory model of quantifying the response impairment seen in anxiety disorders. Little is known however about how different response topographies indicative of conditioned suppression are elicited in humans. Here, we refined a novel virtual reality (VR) paradigm in which presentations of a threat cue of unpredictable duration occurred while participants performed an operant response of shooting and destroying boxes searching for hidden gold. The VR paradigm detected significant suppression of response topographies (shots, hits and breaks) for a Pavlovian threat cue relative to a safety cue and novel cue presentations.

This study examines the human risk factors associated with pilots in runway excursions, by applying a SHELLO model to categorize the, human risk factors and to evaluate the importance based on the opinions of 145 airline pilots. This study integrates aviation management level expert opinions on relative weighting and improvement-achievability in order to develop four kinds of priority risk management strategies for airline pilots to reduce runway excursions. The empirical study based on experts' evaluation suggests that the most important dimension is the liveware/pilot's core ability. From the perspective of front-line pilots, the most important risk factors are the environment, wet/containment runways, and weather issues like rain/thunderstorms.

While the underlying mechanisms driving this subset of phenotypes is unknown, oxytocin (OT) dysregulation is hypothesized to be involved as some studies have shown elevated blood OT and altered OT receptor expression in patients. A Complete Deletion (CD) mouse, modeling the hemizygous deletion in Williams Syndrome, recapitulates many of the phenotypes present in humans. These CD mice also exhibit impaired fear responses in the conditioned fear task. Here, we address whether OT dysregulation is responsible for this impaired associative fear memory response. We show direct delivery of an OT receptor antagonist to the central nervous system did not rescue the attenuated contextual or cued fear memory responses in CD mice. Thus, increased OT signaling is not acutely responsible for this phenotype. We also evaluated OT receptor and serotonin transporter availability in regions related to fear learning, memory and sociability using autoradiography in wild type and CD mice. While no differences withstood correction, we identified regions that may warrant further investigation. There was a nonsignificant decrease in OT receptor expression in the lateral septal nucleus and nonsignificant lowered serotonin transporter availability in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. Together, these data suggest the fear conditioning anomalies in the Williams Syndrome mouse model are independent of any alterations in the oxytocinergic system caused by deletion of the Williams locus.","[Nygaard, Kayla R.; Swift, Raylynn G.; Glick, Rebecca M.; Dougherty, Joseph D.] Washington Univ, Dept Genet, 660 S Euclid Ave,Campus Box 8232, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Nygaard, Kayla R.; Swift, Raylynn G.; Glick, Rebecca M.; Wagner, Rachael E.; Maloney, Susan E.; Dougherty, Joseph D.] Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Maloney, Susan E.; Dougherty, Joseph D.] Washington Univ, Intellectual & Dev Disabil Res Ctr, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Gould, Georgianna G.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Cellular & Integrat Physiol, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA",,"Dougherty, JD (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Genet, 660 S Euclid Ave,Campus Box 8232, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",jdougherty@wustl.edu,,"Wagner, Rachael/0000-0001-5478-139X; Swift, Raylynn/0000-0003-2014-3642; Dougherty, Joseph/0000-0002-6385-3997; Nygaard, Kayla/0000-0003-1640-3026",National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [P50HD103525]; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [5R01MH107515-05]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1745038]; San Antonio Area Foundation; Morrison Trust,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Grant/Award Number: P50HD103525; National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Number: 5R01MH107515-05; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DGE-1745038; San Antonio Area Foundation; The Morrison Trust",,75,1,1,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1601-1848,1601-183X,,GENES BRAIN BEHAV,Genes Brain Behav.,JAN,2022,21,1,,,,,,,e12750,10.1111/gbb.12750,,JUN 2021,12,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,XZ0XU,WOS:000659689500001,33978321,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2022-04-16,

We examined whether the anxiolytic diazepam would reverse the effects of threat on the startle and pupillary reflexes. Twelve male volunteers participated in three weekly sessions in which they received oral treatment with placebo, diazepam 5 mg and diazepam 10 mg, according to a balanced crossover double-blind design. One hour after ingestion of the treatments, miotic responses to light pulses and electromyographic responses of the orbicularis oculi muscle to sound pulses were elicited during alternating periods in which the threat of an electric shock (electrodes attached to the subject's wrist) was present (THREAT) and absent (SAFE). The THREAT condition was associated with a significant increase in the amplitude of the electromyographic (EMG) response, a significant reduction of the miotic response amplitude, and an increase in self-rated anxiety. Diazepam attenuated all these effects of THREAT. Diazepam did not affect the amplitude of the miotic response under the SAFE condition, but did suppress the EMG response under this condition. These results confirm the validity of the fear-potentiated startle reflex and fear-inhibited light reflex as laboratory models of human anxiety, and reveal some differences between the effects of diazepam on the two reflexes.","Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Queens Med Ctr, Div Psychiat,Psychopharmacol Sect, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",,"Bradshaw, CM (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Queens Med Ctr, Div Psychiat,Psychopharmacol Sect, Floor B, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England.",,,,Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission Funding Source: Medline,,,44,61,61,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"6 BONHILL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4PU, ENGLAND",0269-8811,,,J PSYCHOPHARMACOL,J.

We generated fear-susceptible (F-S) or fear-resistant (F-R) phenotypes from an F-8 advanced intercross line (AIL) of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred mice by selective breeding. We identified specific traits underlying individual variability in Pavlovian conditioned fear learning and memory. Offspring of selected lines differed in the acquisition of conditioned fear. Furthermore, F-S mice showed greater cued fear memory and generalised fear in response to a novel context than F-R mice. F-S mice showed greater basal corticosterone levels and hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA levels than F-R mice, consistent with higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis drive. Hypothalamic mineralocorticoid receptor and CRH receptor 1 mRNA levels were decreased in F-S mice as compared with F-R mice. Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) was used to investigate basal levels of brain activity. MEMRI identified a pattern of increased brain activity in F-S mice that was driven primarily by the hippocampus and amygdala, indicating excessive limbic circuit activity in F-S mice as compared with F-R mice. Thus, selection pressure applied to the AIL population leads to the accumulation of heritable trait-relevant characteristics within each line, whereas non-behaviorally relevant traits remain distributed. Selected lines therefore minimise false-positive associations between behavioral phenotypes and physiology. We demonstrate that intrinsic differences in HPA axis function and limbic excitability contribute to phenotypic differences in the acquisition and consolidation of associative fear memory. Identification of system-wide traits predisposing to variability in fear memory may help in the direction of more targeted and efficacious treatments for fear-related pathology.","[McGuire, Jennifer L.; Bergstrom, Hadley C.; Le, Thien; Morgan, Maria; Choi, Kwang; Ursano, Robert J.; Johnson, Luke R.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Bethesda, MD USA; [McGuire, Jennifer L.; Bergstrom, Hadley C.; Le, Thien; Morgan, Maria; Choi, Kwang; Ursano, Robert J.; Johnson, Luke R.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Program Neurosci, Bethesda, MD USA; [Bergstrom, Hadley C.; Le, Thien; Choi, Kwang; Ursano, Robert J.; Johnson, Luke R.] Ctr Study Traumat Stress, Bethesda, MD USA; [Parker, Clarissa C.; Palmer, Abraham A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Tang, Haiying; Selwyn, Reed G.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Bethesda, MD USA; [Silva, Afonso C.] NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Palmer, Abraham A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Johnson, Luke R.] Queensland Univ Technol, Translat Res Inst, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Dept Psychol, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia",,"Johnson, LR (corresponding author), Translat Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",LukeJohnsonPhD@gmail.com,"Silva, Afonso C./A-7129-2009; Ursano, Robert/ABE-6533-2020; Bergstrom, Hadley/S-1178-2019; Palmer, Abraham/L-2158-2014","Silva, Afonso C./0000-0002-6105-7567; Palmer, Abraham/0000-0003-3634-0747; Ursano, Robert/0000-0002-1861-9173; Bergstrom, Hadley/0000-0003-3677-1619; McGuire, Jennifer/0000-0003-3058-5241; Johnson PhD, Luke R/0000-0002-5088-1788","CSTS [G188NW]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01MH079103];  [T32DA007255]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH079103, K01MH070933] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [ZIANS003041] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA021336, T32DA007255] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We would like to thank Dr Laura Tucker, Dr Asamoah Bosomti, Ann Schue, Sumajari Das, Smita Dey, Maj Robert Long, Rose Arditi and Alice Fladung for excellent assistance with aspects of this project.

Rodent studies implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hippocampus in extinction recall and its modulation by context, respectively. The aim of the present study is to investigate the mediating anatomy of extinction recall in healthy humans. Methods: We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol with skin conductance response as the index of conditioned responses. Results: During extinction recall, we found significant activations in vmPFC and hippocampus in response to the extinguished versus an unextinguished stimulus. Activation in these brain regions was positively correlated with the magnitude of extinction memory. Functional connectivity analysis revealed significant positive correlation between vmPFC and hippocampal activation during extinction recall. Conclusions: These results support the involvement of the human hippocampus as well as vmPFC in the recall of extinction memory. Furthermore, this provides a paradigm for future investigations of fronto-temporal function during extinction recall in psychiatric disorders such as posttraurnatic stress disorder.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Psyhciat Neurosci Div, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA USA; Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Neurol, Div Congnit & Behav Neurol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Manchester, NH USA; Ponce Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Ponce, PR USA",,"Rauch, SL (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Psyhciat Neurosci Div, Dept Psychiat, Bldg 149,13th St,2nd Floor, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",rauch@psych.mgh.harvard.edu,"Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018; anand, amit/A-7222-2009",,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH072156] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1R21MH072156-1] Funding Source: Medline,,,49,779,789,1,96,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

The current study examined whether non-Learners, defined as those who fail to show larger electrodermal first interval responses to CS+ than to CS- in the second half of acquisition, show differential electrodermal responding early during acquisition or during extinction or evidence of fear-learning on other measures, including rated CS valence and contingency report. In a sample of 351 participants who completed a standard differential fear-conditioning paradigm that employed electrodermal first and second interval responses (FIR, SIR), continuous CS evaluations, and post-experimental contingency reports to assess fear-learning, 74 participants were identified as non-Learners. These non-Learners displayed overall smaller electrodermal responses but showed evidence for differential conditioning during acquisition in electrodermal FIR (block1) and SIR (blocks 2-3) and in CS evaluations during acquisition (blocks 2-4) and extinction (blocks 1-4). Fifty-nine non-Learners correctly reported the contingencies. A lack of differential electrodermal first interval responding during the second half of acquisition does not indicate the absence of fear-learning. Rather, this criterion appears to capture participants who exhibit low physiological arousal and performance decrements toward the end of acquisition. Applying criteria based on end of acquisition electrodermal responding to determine non-learning results in the exclusion of participants who display fear-learning at other experimental stages or in other measures.","[Lipp, Ottmar, V] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Psychol & Counselling, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Luck, Camilla C.] Curtin Univ, Sch Populat Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia; [Waters, Allison M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Nathan, Qld, Australia",,"Lipp, OV (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Psychol & Counselling, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia.",Ottmar.Lipp@qut.edu.au,"Lipp, Ottmar/A-1254-2007","Lipp, Ottmar/0000-0001-6734-8608; Luck, Camilla/0000-0002-9364-1418",National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [APP1156490],"National Health and Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Number: APP1156490",,27,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,MAR,2022,59,3,,,,,,,e13982,10.1111/psyp.13982,,NOV 2021,15,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,YO8FQ,WOS:000723705300001,34846758,,,,2022-04-16,

Specifically, it is hypothesized that adolescents who report higher levels of street efficacy are less likely to exhibit fear of violence than adolescents who report lower levels of street efficacy. Using panel data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the authors estimate a series of multilevel ordinal logistic regression models to explain the relationship between street efficacy and fear of violence controlling for both individual-level and neighborhood-level covariates. The results confirm the hypothesis that adolescents' prior street efficacy is negatively associated with subsequent fear of violence.

However, a traumatic event can be associated with several cues, and each cue can potentially trigger recollection of the event. We introduced a technique to target all diverse cues associated with an aversive event that causes fear. Methods: In human experiments, 161 subjects underwent modified fear conditioning, in which they were exposed to an unconditioned stimulus (US) or unreinforced CS to reactivate the memory and then underwent extinction, spontaneous recovery, and reinstatement. In animal experiments, 343 rats underwent contextual fear conditioning under a similar protocol as that used in the human experiments. We also explored the molecular alterations after US reactivation in rats. Results: Presentation of a lower intensity US before extinction disrupted the associations between the different CS and reactivated US in both humans and rats. This effect persisted for at least 6 months in humans and was selective to the reactivated US. This procedure was also effective for remote memories in both humans and rats. Compared with the CS, the US induced stronger endocytosis of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid glutamate receptors 1 and 2 and stronger activation of protein kinase A, p70S6 kinase, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein in the dorsal hippocampus in rats. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that a modified US retrieval extinction strategy may have a potential impact on therapeutic approaches to prevent the return of fear.","[Liu, Jianfeng; Zhao, Liyan; Yang, Chang; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Inst Mental Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianfeng; Zhao, Liyan; Yang, Chang; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Minist Hlth, Key Lab Mental Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianfeng; Zhao, Liyan; Xue, Yanxue; Shi, Jie; Luo, Yixiao; Chai, Baisheng; Zhang, Yan; Bao, Yanping; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Int Data Grp, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Suo, Lin] China MeiTan Gen Hosp, Dept Pharm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chai, Baisheng; Yang, Chang; Fang, Qin] Guiyang Med Univ, Sch Pharm, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Chai, Baisheng; Yang, Chang; Fang, Qin] Guiyang Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Pickens, Charles L.] NIDA, Intramural Res Program, NIH, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Mental Hlth, 38 Xue Yuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Jianfeng/0000-0002-3464-6462; Pickens, Charles/0000-0003-3485-949X","National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2011CB707805]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230033, 31100809, 81221002, 81225009]; National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)","This work was supported in part by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2011CB707805) and Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 31230033, 31100809, 81221002, and 81225009).

Generalization as it relates to fear processing is a temporally dynamic process in which animals, including humans, display fear in response to similar yet distinct cues or contexts as the time between training and testing increases. This Review surveys the literature on contextual fear generalization and its relation to several views of memory, including systems consolidation, forgetting, and transformation hypothesis, which differentially implicate roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in memory consolidation and retrieval. We discuss recent evidence on the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to the increase in fear generalization over time and how generalized responding may be modulated by acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval mechanisms. Whereas clinical perspectives of generalization emphasize a lack of fear inhibition to CS- cues or fear toward intermediate CS cues, the time-dependent nature of generalization and its relation to traditional views on memory consolidation and retrieval are often overlooked. Understanding the time-dependent increase in fear generalization has important implications not only for understanding how generalization contributes to anxiety disorders but also for understanding basic long-term memory function.

The traditional account is that these stimuli are the objects of infants' earliest developing fears. We present evidence against the traditional account, and provide an alternative explanation of infants' behaviors toward each stimulus. Specifically, we propose that behaviors typically interpreted as fearful really reflect an array of stimulus-specific responses that are highly dependent on context, learning, and the perceptual features of the stimuli. We speculate about why researchers so commonly misinterpret these behaviors, and conclude with future directions for studying the development of fear in infants and young children.","[LoBue, Vanessa] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, 101 Warren St,Room 301, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Adolph, Karen E.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"LoBue, V (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, 101 Warren St,Room 301, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",vlobue@psychology.rutgers.edu,,,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01-MH109692]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development GrantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R37-HD33486, R01-HD33486]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01HD033486] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH109692] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant R01-MH109692 to Vanessa LoBue and by National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Grant R37-HD33486 and R01-HD33486 to Karen E.

The increasing presence of automation in society has resulted in critical, and often life threatening, situations when information from human and automated sources disagree. It has been known that reliance on human aids decrease during high-risk situations, while reliance on automated aids increase. However, it is also possible that human decision aids gain credibility from users when they embody the charismatic and emotionally expressive gesticulations seen in successful organizational leaders. The present study tested how a human agent's expressiveness when providing information would influence participants' behavioral reliance. Using the program Convoy Leader, participants (n=56) engaged in three decision-making scenarios where risk was manipulated as a within-subject factor and emotional expression as a between-subject factor. Emotional susceptibility, perceived risk, and trust for human as well as automated aids were measured. Overall trust was higher for the automated tool than human decision aid, and that pattern was amplified in conditions without an emotionally expressive human aid. Reliance was greater for emotionally expressive human aids, than stoic human aids, particularly during high risk conditions. The findings suggest that emotional expression of a human aid significantly impacts both reliance and trust of a decision aid, especially at higher risk levels. Emotionally expressive human agents should be utilized in decision conflicts where the automated system has certainly failed.","[Feng, Jing; Sanchez, Joseph; Sall, Robert] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Psychol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Lyons, Joseph B.] US Air Force, Airman Syst Directorate, Res Lab, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA; [Nam, Chang S.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,"Nam, CS (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",csnam@ncsu.edu,,"nam, chang/0000-0001-9005-0703; Feng, Jing/0000-0002-0899-1641",Laboratory for Analytic Sciences (LAS) [H98230-13-D-0054],"This work was supported by the Laboratory for Analytic Sciences (LAS), grant No. H98230-13-D-0054.",,66,2,2,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0899-5605,1532-7876,,MIL PSYCHOL,Milit.

However, no causative link between elevated NE neurotransmission and BLA hyperresponsiveness to fear signals has been established to date in humans. To determine whether or not increased noradrenergic tone enhances BLA responses to fear signals, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a strategy of pharmacologically potentiating NE neurotransmission in healthy volunteers. 18 subjects were scanned two times on a facial emotion paradigm and given either a single-dose placebo or 4 mg of the selective NE reuptake inhibitor reboxetine 2 h prior to an fMRI session. We found that reboxetine induced an amygdala response bias towards fear signals that did not exist at placebo baseline. This pharmacological effect was probabilistically mapped to the BLA. Extrapolation of our data to conditions of traumatic stress suggests that disinhibited endogenous NE signaling could serve as a crucial etiological contributor to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by eliciting exaggerated BLA responses to fear signals.","[Onur, Oezguer A.; Walter, Henrik; Schlaepfer, Thomas E.; Rehme, Anne K.; Schmidt, Christoph; Maier, Wolfgang; Hurlemann, Ren] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychiat, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Onur, Oezguer A.; Hurlemann, Ren] Brain Imaging Ctr W, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Onur, Oezguer A.] Res Ctr Juelich, Inst Neurosci & Biophys Med INB3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Walter, Henrik] Univ Bonn, Div Med Psychol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Schlaepfer, Thomas E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Keysers, Christian] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, BCN NeuroImaging Ctr, NL-9713 AW Groningen, Netherlands",,"Hurlemann, R (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Psychiat, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.",renehurlemann@me.com,"Schlaepfer, Thomas/A-2604-2008; Hurlemann, Rene/G-4164-2012; Keysers, Christian/H-6251-2013; Hurlemann, Rene/AAL-5515-2020; Walter, Henrik/O-2612-2013","Schlaepfer, Thomas/0000-0003-0612-9692; Hurlemann, Rene/0000-0003-2628-565X; Keysers, Christian/0000-0002-2845-5467; Hurlemann, Rene/0000-0003-2628-565X; Onur, Oezguer/0000-0001-8336-7075; Walter, Henrik/0000-0002-9403-6121",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01GW0671]; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [HU1302/2-1]; European Commission Marie Curie ExcellenceEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre,"The authors wish to thank M.

However, anxiety disorders, such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), can occur when fear is inappropriately regulated. Fear conditioning can be used to study aspects of PTSD, and we have developed a model in which pre-exposure to a stressor of repeated footshock enhances conditional fear responding to a single context-shock pairing. The experiments in this chapter address interpretations of this effect including generalization and summation or fear, inflation, and altered pain sensitivity. The results of these experiments lead to the conclusion that pre-exposure to shock sensitizes conditional fear responding to similar less intense stressors. This sensitization effect resists exposure therapy (extinction) and amnestic (NMDA antagonist) treatment. The pattern predicts why in PTSD patients, mild stressors cause reactions more appropriate for the original traumatic stressor and why new fears are so readily formed in these patients. This model can facilitate the study of neurobiological mechanisms underlying sensitization of responses observed in PTSD. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In humans, research suggests that disrupted sleep impairs consolidation of extinction, though no studies have examined this experimentally using total sleep deprivation. METHODS: Seventy-one healthy control subjects underwent a paradigm to acquire conditioned fear to a visual cue. Twenty-four hours after fear conditioning, participants underwent extinction learning. Twenty-four hours after extinction learning, participants underwent extinction recall. Participants were randomized to three groups: 1) well rested throughout testing (normal sleep; n = 21); 2) 36 hours' total sleep deprivation before extinction learning (pre-extinction deprivation; n = 25); or 3) 36 hours' total sleep deprivation after extinction learning and before extinction recall (post-extinction deprivation; n = 25). The groups were compared on blink electromyography reactivity to the condition stimulus during extinction learning and recall. RESULTS: There were no differences among the three groups during extinction learning. During extinction recall, the pre-extinction deprivation group demonstrated significantly less extinction recall than the normal sleep group did. There was no significant difference between the normal sleep and post-extinction deprivation group during extinction recall. Results indicated sleep deprivation before extinction training significantly disrupts extinction recall. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 1) sleep deprivation in the immediate aftermath of trauma could be a potential contributor to posttraumatic stress disorder development and maintenance via interference with natural extinction processes and 2) management of sleep symptoms should be considered during extinction-based therapy.","[Straus, Laura D.] San Diego State Univ, Univ Calif San Diego, Joint Doctoral Program Clin Psychol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Straus, Laura D.] San Diego Vet Affairs, Res Serv, San Diego, CA USA; [Acheson, Dean T.; Risbrough, Victoria B.] San Diego Vet Affairs, San Diego Vet Affairs Healthcare Syst, Ctr Excellence Stress & Mental Hlth, San Diego, CA USA; [Acheson, Dean T.; Risbrough, Victoria B.; Drummond, Sean P.

Factor analysis revealed the importance of country-related aspects, familiarity with bears, experiences in human-wildlife conflict, gender-age differences, respondent's relationship to nature and the origin of their knowledge of the species.

Risk to four ecological services of the South River (human health, water quality, recreation, and the recreational fishery) was evaluated using a multiple stressor-multiple endpoint approach. These four ecological services were selected as endpoints based on stakeholder feedback and prioritized management goals for the river. The BN-RRM approach allowed for the calculation of relative risk to 14 biotic, human health, recreation, and water quality endpoints from chemical and ecological stressors in five risk regions of the South River. Results indicated that water quality and the recreational fishery were the ecological services at highest risk in the South River. Human health risk for users of the South River was low relative to the risk to other endpoints. Risk to recreation in the South River was moderate with little spatial variability among the five risk regions. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis identified stressors and other parameters that influence risk for each endpoint in each risk region. This research demonstrates a probabilistic approach to integrated ecological and human health risk assessment that considers the effects of chemical and ecological stressors across the landscape.","[Harris, Meagan J.; Stinson, Jonah; Landis, Wayne G.] Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll Environm, Inst Environm Toxicol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA",,"Landis, WG (corresponding author), Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll Environm, Inst Environm Toxicol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",wayne.landis@wwu.edu,,"Landis, Wayne/0000-0001-9468-3532",E.

PTSD is a chronic and debilitating anxiety disorder characterized by exaggerated fear and/or anxiety that may develop as a result of exposure to a traumatic event. In this model, rats are exposed to a severe stressor (15 foot shocks) in one environment (Context A) and then subsequently exposed to a milder form of the same stressor (single foot shock) in a different environment (Context B). Animals that did not receive prior shock treatment exhibit fear responsiveness to Context B in line with the severity of the single shock given in this context. Animals that had received prior shock treatment in Context A exhibit an exaggerated learned fear response to Context B. Furthermore, animals receiving a single dose of morphine immediately following the severe stressor in Context A continue to show an enhanced fear response in Context B. However, animals receiving repeated morphine administration (three injections) after exposure to the severe stressor in Context A or a single dose of morphine at 48 h after the severe stressor no longer exhibit an enhancement in fear learning to Context B. These results are consistent with clinical studies suggesting that morphine treatment following a severe stressor may be useful in preventing or reducing the severity of PTSD in at-risk populations.

To address this gap, we conducted a new study in a rare human patient, SM, who has focal bilateral amygdala lesions [4]. To provoke fear in SM, we exposed her to live snakes and spiders, took her on a tour of a haunted house, and showed her emotionally evocative films. On no occasion did SM exhibit fear, and she never endorsed feeling more than minimal levels of fear. Likewise, across a large battery of self-report questionnaires, 3 months of real-life experience sampling, and a life history replete with traumatic events, SM repeatedly demonstrated an absence of overt fear manifestations and an overall impoverished experience of fear. Despite her lack of fear, SM is able to exhibit other basic emotions and experience the respective feelings. The findings support the conclusion that the human amygdala plays a pivotal role in triggering a state of fear and that the absence of such a state precludes the experience of fear itself.","[Feinstein, Justin S.; Tranell, Daniel] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Adolphs, Ralph] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Damasio, Antonio] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",,"Feinstein, JS (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",justin-feinstein@uiowa.edu,"Damasio, Antonio/AAD-1342-2019; Tudusciuc, Oana/C-1339-2011","Tranel, Daniel/0000-0002-1338-1389","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P50 NS19632, R01 DA022549, R01 MH080721]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH080721] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [P50NS019632, P01NS019632] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA022549] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We are greatly indebted to SM for her continued commitment to brain research.

The risk assessment process should not ignore the role of humans in accidental events and the consequences that may derive from human error. This article presents a case study of the Success Likelihood Index Method (SLIM) applied to the Electric Power Company of Serbia (EPCS), with the aim to disclose the importance of human error analysis in risk assessment. A database on work-related injuries, accidents, and critical interventions that occurred over a 10-year period in the EPCS provided the basis for this study. The research comprised analysis of 1074 workplaces, with a total of 3997 employees. A detailed analysis identified 10 typical human errors, performance shaping factors (PSFs), and estimated human error probability (HEP). Based on the obtained research results one can conclude that PSF control remains crucial for human error reduction, and thus prevention of occupational injuries and fatalities (the number of injuries decreased from 58 in 2012 to 44 in 2013, no fatalities recorded). Furthermore, the case study performed at the EPCS confirmed that the SLIM is highly applicable for quantification of human errors, comprehensive, and easy to perform.","[Stojiljkovic, Evica; Glisovic, Srdjan] Univ Nis, Fac Occupat Safety, Nish 18000, Serbia; [Grozdanovic, Miroljub] Engn Acad Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Stojiljkovic, E (corresponding author), Univ Nis, Fac Occupat Safety, Carnojevica 10a, Nish 18000, Serbia.",evica976@gmail.com,"Stojiljkovi?, Evica/ABA-5596-2021","Stojiljkovi?, Evica/0000-0003-0359-7474","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III 43014, III 43011]","This article is a part of the research done within the projects III 43014 and III 43011 financed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.",,17,7,7,0,51,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Consistent with this view, in animal models, antagonists of NMDAR typically impair fear extinction, whereas partial agonists have facilitating effects. Promoting NMDAR function has thus been recognized as a promising strategy towards reduction of fear symptoms in patients suffering from anxiety disorders and post-traumatic disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, application of these drugs in clinical trials has proved of limited utility. Here we summarize recent advances in our knowledge of NMDAR pharmacology relevant for fear extinction, focusing on molecular, cellular, and circuit aspects of NMDAR function as they relate to fear extinction at the level of behavior and cognition. We also discuss how these advances from animal models might help to understand and overcome the limitations of existing approaches in human anxiety disorders and how novel, more specific, and personalized approaches might help advance future therapeutic strategies.","[Radulovic, Jelena; Ren, Lynn Y.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Gao, Can] Xuzhou Med Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Anesthesiol, 209 Tongshan Rd, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Radulovic, J (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",j-radulovic@northwestern.edu,,"Radulovic, Jelena/0000-0002-0268-2426","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH108837, MH078064]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81471101]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM008152] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH078064, T32MH067564, R01MH108837] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The authors acknowledge that this work was supported by NIH grants MH108837 and MH078064 to J.R. and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China grant 81471101 to C.G.,,132,11,12,3,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JAN,2019,236,1,,,,,239,250,,10.1007/s00213-018-5022-5,,,12,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,HL4IV,WOS:000458681900017,30238131,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-16,

Experimental animals, such as rats and mice, have been widely used to model fear. However, higher animals such as nonhuman primates have rarely been used to study fear due to ethical issues and high costs. Tree shrews are small mammals that are closely related to primates; they have been used to model human-related psychosocial conditions such as stress and alcohol tolerance. Here, we describe an experimental paradigm to study the formation and extinction of fear memory in tree shrews. We designed an experimental apparatus of a light/dark box with a voltage foot shock. We found that tree shrews preferred staying in the dark box in the daytime without stimulation and showed avoidance to voltage shocks applied to the footplate in a voltage-dependent manner. Foot shocks applied to the dark box for 5 days (10 min per day) effectively reversed the light dark preference of the tree shrews, and this memory lasted for more than 50 days without any sign of memory decay (extinction) in the absence of further stimulation. However, this fear memory was reversed with 4 days of reverse training by applying the same stimulus to the light box. When reducing the stimulus intensity during the training period, a memory extinction and subsequently reinstatement effects were observed. Thus, our results describe an efficient method of monitoring fear memory formation and extinction in tree shrews.","[Shang, Shujiang; Wang, Cong; Guo, Chengbing; Huang, Xu; Zhang, Chen] Peking Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Membrane Biol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Shang, Shujiang; Wang, Cong; Guo, Chengbing; Huang, Xu; Zhang, Chen] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Shang, Shujiang; Wang, Cong; Guo, Chengbing; Huang, Xu; Wang, Liecheng] Anhui Med Univ, Dept Physiol, Hefei 230032, Peoples R China",,"Wang, LC (corresponding author), Anhui Med Univ, Dept Physiol, Hefei 230032, Peoples R China.",wangliecheng@ahmu.edu.cn; ch.zhang@pku.edu.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2011CB809102, 2014CB942804, 2014BAI03B01, 2012YQ0302604]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31222025, 31171025, 81071075]; National Century Excellent Talents in University of China [NCET-11-0020]; Seeding Grant for Medicine and Life Sciences of Peking University [2014-MB-11]","The authors are grateful to the Animal House Center of the Kunming Institute of Zoology for help on the maintenance and handling of the tree shrews, and to Yonglu Tian and Xiaoling Wang for helpful discussion and technical support in the behavioral experiment.

In recent decades, important progress has been made in delineating the essential neural circuitry and cellular-molecular mechanisms of fear conditioning. Converging lines of evidence indicate that the amygdala is necessarily involved in the acquisition, storage and expression of conditioned fear memory, and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is often proposed as the underlying synaptic mechanism of associative fear memory. Recent studies further implicate the prefrontal cortex-amygdala interaction in the extinction (or inhibition) of conditioned fear. Despite these advances, there are unresolved issues and findings that challenge the validity and sufficiency of the Current amygdalar LTP hypothesis of fear conditioning. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of evidence indicating that fear conditioning depend crucially upon the amygdalar circuit and plasticity.

Poor fear extinction is a well-established biomarker of PTSD that may provide insight into mechanisms underlying cardiovascular risk. The current study probed the cardiovascular response to extinction in a sample of trauma-exposed individuals. Methods: Participants were 51 trauma-exposed women who underwent a fear conditioning paradigm. Heart rate (HR) during extinction was examined in response to a conditioned stimulus that was previously paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (CS + ) and one that was never paired (CS-). Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated at baseline and during the extinction session. Results: Consistent with fear bradycardia, initial HR deceleration (.5-2s) after CS + onset occurred during early extinction and appeared to extinguish over time. Higher baseline HRV was significantly associated with greater fear bradycardia during early extinction. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate a pattern of fear bradycardia in early extinction, which was associated with higher HRV levels and decreased over the course of the extinction phase. These results suggest that increased fear bradycardia may be indicative of greater vagal control (i.e., HRV), both of which are psychophysiological biomarkers that may influence cardiovascular and autonomic disease risk in trauma-exposed individuals.","[Seligowski, Antonia, V; Ressler, Kerry J.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Seligowski, Antonia, V; Merker, Julia B.; Ressler, Kerry J.] McLean Hosp, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02178 USA; [Swiercz, Adam P.; Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC USA; [Park, Jeanie] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Div Renal, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Park, Jeanie] Atlanta Vet Adm Hosp, Atlanta, GA USA; [Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Washington, DC USA; [Jovanovic, Tanja] Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Detroit, MI USA",,"Seligowski, AV (corresponding author), 115 Mill St,Mail Stop 212, Belmont, MA 02478 USA.",aseligowski@mclean.harvard.edu,,,"NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH071537, MH092576, MH098212]","We would like to acknowledge the following three NIMH grants awarded to TJ (all United States): MH071537, MH092576, MH098212.",,52,2,2,2,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0022-3956,1879-1379,,J PSYCHIATR RES,J.

This study examined fear of developing gynecologic cancer among women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions. Methods: Participants were 1142 women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions who were enrolled in the Maryland Women's Health Study. Each participant provided informed consent and completed a questionnaire that was used to obtain information on demographic characteristics, cancer fear, psychologic functioning, and quality of life. Results: Almost 80% of the participants reported at least a little fear of developing gynecologic cancer if they chose not to undergo hysterectomy, and 29.0% reported a lot of fear of developing cancer if they chose not to undergo the surgery. The level of cancer fear was significantly higher among younger women, black women, women with less education, and women reporting a lower income. In addition, the level of fear of developing cancer was significantly and positively associated with anxiety and depression and was significantly and negatively associated with social functioning, physical functioning, and health perception. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a high percentage of women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions, particularly those who are young, less educated, and black, fear that they will develop cancer if they choose not to undergo the surgery. Physicians should provide more information regarding actual gynecologic cancer risk to women contemplating hysterectomy for benign conditions so that women are able to make more informed decisions about undergoing the surgery.","Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gynecol & Obstet, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,"Gallicchio, L (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, 615 N Wolfe St,Room 6132, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",lgallicc@jhsph.edu,,,AHRQ HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality [HS06885] Funding Source: Medline,,,16,12,15,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0033-3174,1534-7796,,PSYCHOSOM MED,Psychosom.

Much criticism has been given to the limitations related to the QRA-models and that the QRAs do not include human and organizational factors (HOF-factors). Norway and UK offshore legislation and guidelines require that the HOF-factors are included in the QRAs. A study of 15 QRAs shows that the factors are to some extent included, and there are large differences between the QRAs. The QRAs are categorized into four levels according to the findings. Level 1 QRAs do not describe or comment on the HOF-factors at all. Relevant research projects have been conducted to fulfill the requirements of Level 3 analyses. At this level, there is a systematic collection of data related to HOF. The methods are systematic and documented, and the QRAs are adjusted. None of the QRAs fulfill the Level 4 requirements. Level 4 QRAs include the model and describe the HOF-factors as well as explain how the results should be followed up in the overall risk management. Safety audits by regulatory authorities are probably necessary to point out the direction for QRA and speed up the development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The BLA contains Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and parvalbumin (PV) neurons. CEA neurons are primarily inhibitory (GABAergic) that comprise enkephalin (ENK) interneurons and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) - neurons that project to the periaqueductal grey. The purpose of our experiment was to determine the pattern of activation of CaMKII/PV and ENK/CRF neurons following the expression of acute pain, conditioned fear, and FCA. A significant reduction was observed in nociceptive behaviors in mice re-exposed to a contextually-aversive environment. Using NeuN and cFos as markers for activated neurons, CaMKII, PV, ENK, or CRF were used to identify neuronal subtypes. We find that mice expressing conditioned fear displayed an increase in c-Fos/CaMKII co-localization in the lateral amygdala and BLA compared to controls. Additionally a significant increase in cFos/CRF co-localization was observed in mice expressing FCA. These results show that amygdala processing of conditioned contextual aversive, nociceptive, and FCA behaviors involve different neuronal phenotypes and neural circuits between, within, and from various amygdala nuclei. This information will be important in developing novel therapies for treating pain and emotive disorders in humans.","[Butler, Ryan K.; Barbar, Megan; Thomas, Jess; Hughes, Mary A.; Lascelles, B.

The use of epidemiologic data in environmental health policy has been limited particularly in the environmental regulatory arena. Epidemiologic risk assessment (ERA) is different from risk assessment and the interplay between the two has led to some misconceptions over the promise and practice of epidemiologic data. The current risk assessment process was designed in a time when the need for regulation was great and the epidemiologic information was sparse. There was little time for the consideration of conducting specific studies to improve the information base for environmental health policy. Animal bioassays could be conducted under standardized protocols within defined time periods. The limitations and uncertainties of animal studies also became standardized and risk assessors became comfortable with their models of extrapolation. As the cost of regulations have grown, the economic realities of regulating with little or no data to support actual public health benefit have become a political and legal liability. Major among epidemiology's advantages is that the information is of direct relevance. The majority of epidemiology data are observation and whether the number of studies is broad enough, the data can be generalized to major segments of the population. The uncertainties in animal-based risk assessments are likely to be greater than the uncertainties associated with epidemiologic studies. Another advantage is the range of extrapolation is often smaller. Another advantage is that epidemiologic data include the genetic diversity and variability in other endogenous factors inherent in human populations. The homogeneity of animal studies has often been cited as an advantage but is unrepresentative of the heterogeneity of the human race. Epidemiology does have its limitations. A major limitation is the time needed to obtain a database sufficient for policy-making purposes and the resources needed to conduct the research to develop the database. This has often prompted the conduct of poorly designed studies, forced the use of data collected for other purposes or improper use of existing data. Four situations where epidemiology should be pursued are discussed. Once an environmental health decision has been made, epidemiologic studies should be considered for documenting the reduction of exposure and therefore disease in the population. This traditional use of epidemiology has rarely been applied in the environmental health arena. A final consideration on the use of epidemiologic data is the need to provide a sense of perspective to set priorities in the larger context of public health priorities. The role of environmental pollutants in causing disease may in some cases be minor in comparison to other risk factors and needs to be considered in setting environmental regulations.

Here, we confirmed whether DCS (100 mg) and VPA (400 mg) act in off-line learning processes during sleep or waking, for further clinical application to anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We performed a randomized, blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 90 healthy adults. Visual cues and electric shocks were used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US), respectively. The extinction effect was observed not in simple recall after the extinction of coupled CS US, but was observed in the post-re-exposure phase after unexpected re-exposure to reinstatement CS US coupling. Newly acquired conditioned fear was also eliminated or habituated by DCS and VPA administration, in line with previous findings. Furthermore, VPA facilitated the off-line learning process of conditioned fear extinction and habituation during sleep, while DCS facilitated this process during waking. These novel findings suggest that DCS and VPA might enhance exposure-based cognitive therapy for anxiety disorders and PTSD by reducing the vulnerability to reinstatement and preventing relapses of fear-conditioned responses, and provide evidence for a peculiarity of the sleep-dependent off-line learning process for conditioned fear extinction.

These findings raised safety concerns in the context of human donor milk banking given the potential risk of HPV transmission to recipient infants. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the Holder pasteurization, a procedure currently in use in human donor milk banks for milk pasteurization, completely inactivates high-risk and low-risk HPV. Methods: HPV pseudoviruses (PsV) were generated, spiked into cell culture medium or donor human milk and subjected to thermal inactivation. HPV PsV infectivity and morphological integrity was analyzed by cell-based assay and by electron microscopy, respectively. Results: The Holder pasteurization completely inactivated the infectivity of high-risk (types 16 and 18) and low-risk (type 6) HPV both in cell culture medium and in human milk causing PsV particle disassembly. Conclusions: The results presented here indicate that the Holder pasteurization is an efficient procedure to inactivate high-risk and low-risk HPV thus preventing the potential risk of their transmission through human donor milk.","[Moro, Guido E.] Biomedia, Italian Assoc Human Milk Banks AIBLUD, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Donalisio, Manuela; Cagno, Valeria; Lembo, David] Univ Turin, Dept Clin & Biol Sci, I-10043 Turin, Italy; [Vallino, Marta] CNR, Inst Plant Virol, I-10126 Turin, Italy; [Arslanoglu, Sertac] Italian Assoc Human Milk Banks, Milan, Italy; [Tonetto, Paola; Bertino, Enrico] Univ Turin, Neonatal Care Unit, Turin, Italy",,"Moro, GE (corresponding author), Biomedia, Italian Assoc Human Milk Banks AIBLUD, Via Libero Temolo 4, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",guidoemoro@tiscali.it,"Cagno, Valeria/AAE-7612-2020; Arslanoglu, Sertac/ABE-8915-2021","Cagno, Valeria/0000-0002-5597-334X; Lembo, David/0000-0002-0969-100X; BERTINO, Enrico/0000-0002-6369-9352","Iolanda Minoli Foundation, San Giuseppe University Hospital, Milan, Italy","This research has been partly supported by the Iolanda Minoli Foundation, San Giuseppe University Hospital, Milan, Italy.

Yet, because it has been assumed to be acute and transitory, predator-induced stress has not been much studied by either comparative physiologists or population ecologists, until relatively recently. The focus in biomedical research has always been on chronic stress in humans, which most comparative physiologists would agree results from sustained psychological stress linked to mere thoughts rather than acute physical crises (like surviving a predator attack) or chronic physical challenges (such as a shortage of food). Population ecologists have traditionally focused solely on the acute physical crisis of surviving a direct predator attack rather than whether the risk of such an attack may have a sustained effect on other demographic processes (e.g. the birth rate). Demographic experiments have now demonstrated that exposure to predators or predator cues can have sustained effects that extend to affecting birth and survival in free-living animals, and a subset of these have documented associated physiological stress effects. These and similar results have prompted some authors to speak of an ecology of fear, but others object that the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding predation remain unknown. Recent biomedical studies on animals in the laboratory have demonstrated that exposure to predators or predator cues can induce sustained psychological stress that is directly comparable to chronic stress in humans, and this has now in fact become one of the most common stressors used in studies of the animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We review these recent findings and suggest ways the laboratory techniques developed to measure the neural circuitry of fear could be adapted for use on free-living animals in the field, in order to: (i) test whether predator risk induces sustained psychological stress in wild animals, comparable to chronic stress in humans and (ii) directly investigate the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding predation and hence the ecology of fear.","[Clinchy, Michael] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; [Sheriff, Michael J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zanette, Liana Y.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Clinchy, M (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",mclinchy@uvic.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Rudy Boonstra for organizing this Special Feature on the Ecology of Stress; Jay Schulkin for his persistence in encouraging us to explore the current research concerning the neurological effects of fear; Tony D.

Here we briefly summarize regulatory risk assessment in the context of innovative risk assessment approaches based on an evolving understanding of the underlying scientific disciplines that support risk analysis more broadly.

Acoustic startle probes were also presented during both threat and safe periods, and the reflexive eye blink, the skin conductance response, and cardiac changes to the startle probe measured. All participants reacted with greater defensive reactivity, including potentiated startle blinks, heightened skin conductance, and cardiac deceleration in the context of threat, compared to safe, cues. Individuals reporting high dental fear were significantly more reactive during threat periods, compared to low fear individuals, showing larger blink reflexes and heightened electrodermal activity, as well as heightened autonomic responses to the startle probe itself. Individual differences in defensive reactivity persisted even after participants received a single mild shock halfway through the experiment. The data indicate that threat of shock elicits heightened defensive reactivity in those reporting high dental fear, consistent with the hypothesis that fear of potentially painful events may be a potent mediator of the anxiety involved in anticipated medical and dental treatment.

However, the majority of studies on interspecific communication of emotions so far focused on the senses of vision and hearing while the contribution of the sense of smell has rarely been studied in this context. Thus, the aim of our study was to assess if horses display differential behaviour in response to human fear and non-fear odour. Body odour samples were collected from 10 adult humans (Homo sapiens) in fear and happiness condition, respectively. The human body odour samples collected in these two conditions, together with a control condition, were then presented to a total of 21 horses (Equus ferus caballus). We found that the horses displayed some differential behaviour in response to human fear and non-fear odour. The horses lifted their heads significantly more frequently and for longer in the fear and in the control condition compared to the happiness condition. Similarly, the horses tended to touch a familiar person that was present during the test more frequently and for longer in the fear condition compared to the happiness condition. Additionally, depending on odour condition, the horses differed in the time they spent keeping their ears back. These results can be explained in the context of the process of domestication which may have favoured the development of the ability to recognize heterospecific emotions. To conclude, in the present study we provide evidence for a possible purely olfactory recognition of human emotions by horses.","[Sabiniewicz, Agnieszka; Tarnowska, Karolina; Swiatek, Robert; Sorokowski, Piotr] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Psychol, Dawida 1, PL-50529 Wroclaw, Poland; [Sabiniewicz, Agnieszka] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Smell & Taste Clin, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Laska, Matthias] Linkoping Univ, Dept Phys Chem & Biol, S-58330 Linkoping, Sweden",,"Sabiniewicz, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Interdisciplinary Ctr Smell & Taste, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",a.sabiniewicz@gmail.com,,"Laska, Matthias/0000-0001-5583-2697",,,,48,7,7,10,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1591,1872-9045,,APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI,Appl.

Substantial evidence has shown that extinction is a new learning process that is highly context-dependent. Several recovery effects (renewal, spontaneous recovery, and reinstatement) after extinction suggest that the contextual modulation of extinction is a critical behavioral mechanism underlying fear extinction. in addition, recent studies demonstrate a critical role for hippocampus in the context control of extinction. A growing body of evidence suggests that the hippocampus not only plays a role in contextual encoding and retrieval of fear extinction memories, but also interacts with other brain structures to regulate context-specificity of fear extinction. in this article, the authors will first discuss the fundamental behavioral features of the context effects of extinction and its underlying behavioral mechanisms. In the second part, the review will focus on the brain mechanisms for the contextual control of extinction.

The last two decades have witnessed a surge of interest in extinction learning. First, extinction learning is observed across species, and especially research on rodents has made great strides in characterising the physical substrate underlying extinction learning. Second, extinction learning is considered of great clinical significance since it constitutes a crucial component of exposure treatment. While effective in reducing fear responding in the short term, extinction learning can lose its grip, resulting in a return of fear (i.e., laboratory model for relapse of anxiety symptoms in patients). Optimization of extinction learning is, therefore, the subject of intense investigation. It is thought that the success of extinction learning is, at least partly, determined by the mismatch between what is expected and what actually happens (prediction error). However, while much of our knowledge about the neural circuitry of extinction learning and factors that contribute to successful extinction learning comes from animal models, translating these findings to humans has been challenging for a number of reasons. Here, we present an overview of what is known about the animal circuitry underlying extinction of fear, and the role of prediction error. In addition, we conducted a systematic literature search to evaluate the degree to which state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods have contributed to translating these findings to humans. Results show substantial overlap between networks in animals and humans at a macroscale, but current imaging techniques preclude comparisons at a smaller scale, especially in sub-cortical areas that are functionally heterogeneous. Moreover, human neuroimaging shows the involvement of numerous areas that are not typically studied in animals. Results obtained in research aimed to map the extinction circuit are largely dependent on the methods employed, not only across species, but also across human neuroimaging studies. Directions for future research are discussed.","[Sevenster, Dieuwke; D'Hooge, Rudi] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Lab Biol Psychol, Tiensestr 102, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Sevenster, Dieuwke] Univ Utrecht, Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Visser, Renee M.] Univ Cambridge, Med Res Council Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, 15 Chaucer Rd, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England",,"Sevenster, D (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",d.sevenster@uu.nl,,"Visser, Renee/0000-0003-0376-8165",FWO-FlandersFWO [12P8715N]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship from the European Union (Horizon 2020) [705641]; KU LeuvenKU Leuven; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_UU_00005/15] Funding Source: UKRI,DS was supported by an FWO-Flanders postdoctoral fellowship (12P8715N).

Previous work has suggested that anatomical subdivisions of mPFC make distinct contributions to fear expression and inhibition, and that the functional output of this processing is relayed to the BLA complex. However, it remains unknown whether synaptic plasticity in mPFC-BLA networks contributes to fear memory encoding. Here we use optogenetics and ex vivo electrophysiology to reveal the impact of fear conditioning on BLA excitatory and feedforward inhibitory circuits formed by projections from infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices. In naive mice, these pathways recruit equivalent excitation and feedforward inhibition in BLA principal neurons. However, fear learning leads to a selective decrease in inhibition: excitation balance in PL circuits that is attributable to a postsynaptic increase in AMPA receptor function. These data suggest a pathway-specific mechanism for fear memory encoding by adjustment of mPFC-BLA transmission. Upon reengagement of PL by conditioned cues, these modifications may serve to amplify emotional responses.","Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Fishberg Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA",,"Clem, RL (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Friedman Brain Inst, Fishberg Dept Neurosci, 1470 Madison Ave,Box 1065, New York, NY 10029 USA.",roger.clem@mssm.edu,"Carvalho, Maithe Arruda/AAW-2490-2021","Arruda-Carvalho, Maithe/0000-0002-7832-3729",National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavioral Research Foundation; Icahn School of Medicine; Human Frontiers Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH105414] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by a National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavioral Research Foundation (to R.L.C.), generous seed funds from the Icahn School of Medicine (to R.L.C.), and a postdoctoral fellowship from the Human Frontiers Foundation (to M.

However, some dogs experience their veterinary visits negatively, which poses a risk of injury to the veterinary staff, their guardian (owner) and themselves. It may also influence the regularity of non-urgent veterinary appointments. To date there have been conflicting reports relating to the proportion of dogs that show fear during their veterinary visits. In this study, we explored the risk factors associated with fear during veterinary examination and in novel situations (including first time at the veterinary clinic) from 26,555 responses in the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire database. According to their guardians, 41% of companion dogs displayed mild to moderate fearful behaviour when examined by a veterinarian, and 14% exhibited severe or extreme fear. A similar trend was observed with dogs responding fearfully when in unfamiliar situations, including the dog's first time at the veterinary clinic. Chi-squared tests showed every bivariate relationship between fear and the environmental and demographic factors measured was significant (p < 0.05). The most important predictors of fear in a veterinary examination were, in order: the dog's breed group (27.1%), their history of roles or activities (16.7%), where they were sourced (15.2%), their weight (12%), the age of other dogs in the household (9.5%) and dog owner experience (6.3%). However, combined these risk factors only explain a total of 7% of variance of fear observed during veterinary examination. This suggests that fear exhibited during veterinary visits is common in dogs, but that the environment or human-animal interactions are likely to contribute more to prevalence and severity of this problem than the demographic factors measured here. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for future research aimed at facilitating less stressful veterinary visits for dogs and their guardians.","[Edwards, Petra T.; Hazel, Susan J.; McArthur, Michelle L.; Smith, Bradley P.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Anim & Vet Sci, Roseworthy Campus, Roseworthy, SA, Australia; [Browne, Matthew] CQUniv Australia, Sch Hlth Med & Appl Sci, Bundaberg, Qld, Australia; [Serpell, James A.] Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Dept Clin Sci & Adv Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Smith, Bradley P.] CQUniv Australia, Sch Hlth Med & Appl Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Smith, Bradley P.] CQUniv Australia, Sch Hlth Med & Appl Sci, Appleton Inst, Wayville, SA, Australia",,"Edwards, PT (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Anim & Vet Sci, Roseworthy Campus, Roseworthy, SA, Australia.",petra.edwards@adelaide.edu.au,"Hazel, Susan J./D-3627-2014","Hazel, Susan J./0000-0002-1804-690X; Smith, Bradley/0000-0002-0873-3917",,,,68,11,11,3,22,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 22,2019,14,7,,,,,,,e0215416,10.1371/journal.pone.0215416,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,IW4UB,WOS:000484974100006,31329583,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-16,

However, there is also a case for identifying the risks presented by inappropriate or absent HRM practices. Although risk management has been established in the broader management literature for over two decades, human resource related risks have not featured as prominently as other types of risks. HRM as a discipline has a role to play in addressing this situation and raising awareness of human resource issues as risks for the organization. A review of papers published since the year 2000 in a broad range of high quality management journals, identifies that limited research has thus far taken a risk management perspective on human resources. Although the HRM and risk management disciplines stand to benefit from drawing the two areas together, this review concludes that further research and development of the phenomenon of human resource risk management is needed.

Little is known, however, about the molecular processes linking these emotional and mood disorders. Based on previously reported phosphorylation patterns of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the brain, we hypothesized that ERK's upstream activators intertwine fear and mood regulation through their hippocampal actions. We tested this hypothesis by studying the upstream regulation of ERK signaling in behavioral models of fear and depression. Wild-type and ERK1-deficient mice were used to study the dorsohippocampal actions of the putative ERK activators: mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK), protein kinase C (PKC), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Mice lacking ERK1 exhibited enhanced fear extinction and reduced depression caused by overactivation of ERK2. Both behaviors were reversed by inhibition of MEK, however the extinction phenotype depended on hippocampal, whereas the depression phenotype predominantly involved extrahippocampal MEK. Unexpectedly, inhibition of PKC accelerated extinction and decreased depression by ERK-independent mechanisms, whereas inhibition of PKA did not produce detectable molecular or behavioral effects in the employed paradigm. These results indicate that, contrary to fear conditioning but similar to mood stabilization, extinction of fear required upregulation of MEK/ERK and downregulation of ERK-independent PKC signaling.

The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users. Materials and methods Three groups, comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants (CN), 30 occasional cocaine (OC), and 48 regular recreational cocaine (RC) users, were compared. An emotional facial expression (EFE) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) was administered. Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived. Participants were also assessed with the Eyes task to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised to measure psychopathology. Results There were no group differences in psychopathology or eyes task performance, but the RC group, who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group, exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups. The RC group also correctly identified anger, fear, happiness, and surprise, more slowly than CN, but not OC participants. The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust. The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine, or ecstasy, because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired. Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition, amygdala dysfunction, and etiology are discussed.","Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Dept Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England",,"Morgan, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Dept Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England.",m.j.morgan@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,47,41,44,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,OCT,2007,194,2,,,,,151,159,,10.1007/s00213-007-0829-5,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,212XJ,WOS:000249630000002,17554526,,,,2022-04-16,

Survey data were collected from 1716 residents of coastal areas of the USA affected by Hurricane Sandy. Respondents were randomly assigned to receive a combination of textual messages about a hypothetical approaching hurricane, including hazard-based, impact-based, and fear-based messages. The analysis examines how the experimental messages influenced respondents' evacuation intentions, risk perceptions, efficacy beliefs, and perceptions of the information and its source. The influence of non-message factors, including respondents' actual and perceived geographical exposure to hurricane-related risks, evacuation planning, and hurricane-related experiences, is also investigated. The results indicate that the high-impact and fear messages increased evacuation intentions, risk perceptions, and response efficacy, but the effects were small. The hazard message manipulations did not significantly influence most of the dependent variables examined; in particular, neither of the two storm surge messages tested increased evacuation intentions or risk perceptions relative to the wind-only or flood message. There were also no significant differences in message effects among respondents who lived or thought they lived in areas at higher risk. Further, several individual difference variables examined influenced evacuation intentions more than the message variations. Overall, experience evacuating for Sandy was the strongest predictor of evacuation intentions. These results indicate the importance of designing and evaluating hazard risk communications in the context of the other messages people are receiving and the individual differences that influence protective decision making.","[Morss, Rebecca E.; Demuth, Julie L.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Cuite, Cara L.; Hallman, William K.; Shwom, Rachael L.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Human Ecol, New Brunswick, NJ USA",,"Morss, RE (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",morss@ucar.edu,"Hallman, William K/G-3591-2017","Hallman, William K/0000-0002-4524-9876",NJ Sea Grant Coastal Storm Awareness Program [R/CSAP-1-NJ]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Lucas Marxen of the Office of Research Analytics at Rutgers University for assistance with the GIS analysis and for preparing Fig. 1.

The stress response includes the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex and catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves. These stress hormones, in turn, provide feedback to the brain and influence neural structures that control emotion and cognition. To illustrate this influence, we focus on how it impacts fear conditioning, a behavioral paradigm widely used to study the neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition, expression, consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of emotional memories. We also discuss how stress and the endocrine mediators of the stress response influence the morphological and electrophysiological properties of neurons in brain areas that are crucial for fear-conditioning processes, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The information in this review illuminates the behavioral and cellular events that underlie the feedforward and feedback networks that mediate states of fear and stress and their interaction in the brain.","[Rodrigues, Sarina M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Personal & Social Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [LeDoux, Joseph E.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [LeDoux, Joseph E.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [LeDoux, Joseph E.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Emot Brain Inst Labs, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA; [Sapolsky, Robert M.] Stanford Med Ctr, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sapolsky, Robert M.] Stanford Med Ctr, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Rodrigues, SM (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Psychol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",sarina.rodrigues@oregonstate.edu; ledoux@cns.nyu.edu; sapolsky@stanford.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [5R01 AG020633] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50 MH058911, K05 MH067048, R37 MH037884, R01 MH046516] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K05MH067048, P50MH058911, R01MH046516] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R01AG020633] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,184,348,355,0,124,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0147-006X,1545-4126,,ANNU REV NEUROSCI,Annu.

Studies show that both fear conditioning and episodic memory are heritable, but no study has evaluated whether they reflect common or separate genetic factors. To this end, we studied episodic memory and fear conditioning in 173 healthy twin pairs using visual stimuli predicting unconditioned electric shocks.MethodsFear conditioning acquisition and extinction was determined using conditioned visual stimuli predicting unconditioned mild electric shocks, whereas electrodermal activity served as the fear learning index. Episodic memory was evaluated using cued recall of pictorial stimuli unrelated to conditioning. We used multivariate structural equation modeling to jointly analyze memory performance and acquisition as well as extinction of fear conditioning.ResultsBest-fit twin models estimated moderate genetic loadings for conditioning and memory measures, with no genetic covariation between them.ConclusionIndividual differences in fear conditioning and episodic memory reflect distinct genetically influenced processes, suggesting that the genetic risk for learning-induced anxiety disorders includes at least two memory-related genetic factors. These findings are consistent with the facts that the two separate learning forms are distant in their evolutionary development, involve different brain mechanisms, and support that genetically independent memory systems are pivotal in the development and maintenance of syndromes related to fear learning.","[Fredrikson, Mats; Annas, Peter] Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, SE-75142 Uppsala, Sweden; [Fredrikson, Mats] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hettema, John M.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Virginia Inst Psychiat & Behav Genet, Dept Psychiat, Richmond, VA USA",,"Fredrikson, M (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, SE-75142 Uppsala, Sweden.",mats.fredrikson@psyk.uu.se,,,Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Swedish Brain Foundation,This work was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Brain Foundation to M.F.,,57,3,3,0,20,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0955-8829,1473-5873,,PSYCHIAT GENET,Psychiatr.

Human resource problems that emerged as a result of the pandemic made every company strive to protect employee safety. The food and beverage sector is one of the industries maintained to continue operating despite the large-scale social restrictions imposed in several regions, including an instant food company in East Java. This study aims to identify and determine human resource risk control to support employee productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research used qualitative data based obtained through interviews, observation, and documentation. The method in this study used a combination of Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) and Bow Tie to identify, measure, and anticipate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the company. The output result of the Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) method is the Risk Priority Number (RPN) score. The three activities with the highest RPN value were health services at the polyclinic, employee meal activities in the canteen, and activities inside and outside the factory. This analysis's results were continued by using the Bow Tie method to identify the causes, prevention, impact, and recovery of these risks. Bow Tie analysis results formed the basis for the preparation of Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA). The risk control of human resources is focused on increasing employee productivity by reducing days lost due to labor shortages. In the end, the study results are expected to become recommendations in the evaluation of risk control and preventive measures for COVID-19 in manufacturing companies.","[Ambarwati, Rita] Univ Muhammadiyah Sidoarjo, Fac Business Law & Social Sci, Sidoarjo, Indonesia; [Yuliastri, Diah] Univ Muhammadiyah Sidoarjo, Fac Business Law & Social Sci, Master Management, Majapahit 666b, Sidoarjo 61215, Indonesia; [Sulistiyowati, Wiwik] Univ Muhammadiyah Sidoarjo, Fac Sci & Technol, Majapahit 666b, Sidoarjo 61215, Indonesia",,"Ambarwati, R (corresponding author), Majapahit 666b, Sidoarjo 61215, Indonesia.",ritaambarwati@umsida.ac.id; diah.yuliastri@gmail.com; wiwik@umsida.ac.id,"ambarwati, rita/AAA-8296-2020; Sulistiyowati, Wiwik/AAA-2835-2022","ambarwati, rita/0000-0001-8302-1170; Sulistiyowati, Wiwik/0000-0001-7325-2215",Universitas Muham-madiyah Sidoarjo,The authors acknowledge the invaluable role Universitas Muham-madiyah Sidoarjo in supporting the document.,,35,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-4230,1873-3352,,J LOSS PREVENT PROC,J.

The presentation of relevant information during memory reconsolidation could then result in the modification of a destabilized memory trace, by allowing the memory trace to be updated before being reconsolidated. In line with this idea, Schiller et al. (2010) have demonstrated that memory retrieval shortly before extinction training can prevent the later recovery of conditioned fear responding that is observed after regular extinction training. Those findings have been the subject of considerable controversy, due in part to theoretical reasons but also due to a number of failures to obtain similar results in conceptual replication attempts. Here, we report the results of a highly powered, direct, independent replication of the critical conditions of Schiller et al. (2010, Experiment 1). Due to misrepresentation of the exclusion criteria in the original Schiller et al. (2010) report, data collection was considerably delayed. When we eventually managed to attain our pre-registered sample size, we found that we could not observe any benefit of reactivation-extinction over regular extinction training in preventing recovery of conditioned fear. The results of the present study, along with the mixed findings in the literature and the misreporting in Schiller et al. (2010), give cause to question whether there is robust evidence that reactivation-extinction prevents the return of fear in humans. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The authors revised and tested a form of the Fear of Falling Questionnaire with three groups of older adults: 405 recovering from hip fracture, 89 healthy community dwelling, and 42 with severe fear of falling. Test-retest reliability was evaluated in a subsample of 16 hip fracture patients. Internal consistency was compared across all groups. Construct validity was established through factor analysis, convergent validity with a measure of fall-related self-efficacy, and discriminant validity with measures of depression and affect. Results: A revised two-factor, six-item scale appears to have adequate psychometric properties. Scores were lower in the healthy comparison group relative to the hip fracture and fear of falling groups. Cronbach's a ranged from 0.72-0.83, with test-retest reliability of 0.82. Correlations with a measure of fall-related self-efficacy were moderate for the hip fracture group (0.42) and high with the healthy comparison (0.68) and fear of falling (0.70) groups. Correlations with depression and negative and positive affect were low to moderate. Conclusions: The Fear of Falling Questionnaire - Revised shows promise as a self-report measure of fear of falling, and is one of the first to be tested in older adults recovering from hip fracture. Advantages are that it is global rather than situation-specific and measures fear rather than self-efficacy. Future research on this scale is recommended in other older adult samples for whom fear of falling is relevant.","[Bower, Emily S.; Petkus, Andrew J.; Malcarne, Vanessa L.] UCSD Joint Doctoral Program Clin Psychol, SDSU, San Diego, CA USA; [Wetherell, Julie Loebach] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, San Diego, CA USA; [Wetherell, Julie Loebach] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Merz, C.

Thus, it is important to understand factors that may contribute to cortisol reactivity as well as those that determine its predictive relation to early emerging anxiety. In this vein, the current study investigated maternal comforting behaviors, both solicited and unsolicited by the toddler, as correlates of cortisol reactivity at 2 years of age. Furthermore, we investigated maternal comforting behaviors and behavioral indicators of fear in both a low-threat and a high-threat context as moderators of the relation between cortisol reactivity at age 2 and change in anxiety from age 2 to age 3. The sample comprised 99 2-year-old toddlers and their mothers. Toddlers provided saliva samples at baseline and after a fear-eliciting stimulus that were assayed for cortisol. Mothers were observed for comforting behavior while interacting with their toddlers in laboratory tasks and completed questionnaires about their toddlers' anxiety. Results indicated that unsolicited (spontaneous) comforting behavior related to toddler cortisol reactivity above and beyond solicited comforting and the level of fear toddlers displayed in the same task. Moreover, fear in a low-threat context, but not in a high-threat context, moderated the relation between cortisol reactivity and change in anxiety, such that cortisol reactivity had a positive relation to anxiety at extreme levels of low-threat fear. Results suggest the importance of considering the caregiving environment and context-specific fear in understanding the nature of cortisol reactivity during the toddler years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Neural plasticity in the amygdala is essential for both initial fear learning and fear expression, and strengthening of synaptic connections between the medial geniculate nucleus (MgN) and amygdala is critical for auditory fear learning. However, very little is known about what happens in the MgN-amygdala pathway during fear recall and extinction, in which conditional fear decreases with repeated presentations of the auditory stimulus alone. In the present study, we found that optogenetic inhibition of activity in the MgN-amygdala pathway during fear retrieval and extinction reduced expression of conditional fear. While this effect persisted for at least two weeks following pathway inhibition, it was specific to the context in which optogenetic inhibition occurred, linking MgN-BLA inhibition to facilitation of extinction-like processes. Reduced fear expression through inhibition of the MgN-amygdala pathway was further characterized by similar synaptic expression of GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits compared to what was seen in controls. Inhibition also decreased CREB phosphorylation in the amygdala, similar to what has been reported following auditory fear extinction. We then demonstrated that this effect was reduced by inhibition of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. These results demonstrate a new and important role for the MgN-amygdala pathway in extinction-like processes, and show that suppressing activity in this pathway results in a persistent decrease in fear behavior.","[Ferrara, Nicole C.; Trask, Sydney; Pullins, Shane E.; Helmstetter, Fred J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Garland Hall,POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",,"Helmstetter, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Garland Hall,POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",fjh@uwm.edu,,"Ferrara, Nicole/0000-0003-4796-1135","National Institute of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH112141, AG053854, F32MH122092, F32MH120938]","This work was supported by National Institute of Health (NIH) grants MH112141 and AG053854 (FJH) , F32MH122092 (NCF) , and F32MH120938 (ST) .",,52,1,1,0,0,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1074-7427,1095-9564,,NEUROBIOL LEARN MEM,Neurobiol.

Unique patterns of activation developed within anterior cingulate and visual cortices as learning progressed. Training with the CS+ increased active tissue volume and shifted the timing of peak fMRI signal toward CS onset within the anterior cingulate. Within the visual cortex, active tissue volume increased with repeated CS+ presentations, while cross-correlation between the functional time course and CS- presentations decreased.

This fear conditioning deficit may be due to memory impairment or a reduction in fear in lesioned animals. To address these possibilities, the authors examined unconditioned and conditioned fear in male Sprague-Dawley rats that had received intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusions of kainic acid (KA) 30 days prior to testing. Animals that had received bilateral ICV infusions of KA (1.0 mul of 0.8 mg/ml solution per side) exhibited cell loss that was primarily confined to the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus. Kainic acid lesions impaired contextual and cued fear conditioning but did not affect unconditioned fear in a light:dark test of anxiety. Moreover, animals with KA lesions did not habituate to the light:dark apparatus when tested over a 3-day period. These data suggest that decreases in fear conditioning produced by hippocampal lesions reflect a memory deficit and not a lack of fear.

Conditioned fear memory, a representative model of traumatic memories, is observed across species from lower to higher animals, including humans. Numerous studies have investigated the mechanisms ofconditioned fear memory and have led to the identification of the underlying processes involved in fear memory regulation, including cellular and systems consolidation of fear conditioning, destabilization/reconsolidation and extinction after fear memory retrieval, and forgetting of fear memory. These studies suggested that mechanisms for fear memory regulation are shared by humans and other higher animals. Additionally, rodent studies have identified the mechanisms of fear memory at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels. Findings from these studies in rodents have been applied to facilitate the development and improvement of PTSD intervention. For instance, reconsolidation and extinction of fear memories have been applied for PTSD treatment to improve prolonged exposure (PE) therapy, an effective psychotherapy for PTSD. Combination of medications weakening retrieved traumatic memory (e.g., by facilitating both destabilization and extinction) with PE therapy may contribute to improvement of PTSD. Interestingly, a recent study in mice identified forgetting of fear memory as another potential therapeutic target for PTSD. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in fear memory processes is likely to facilitate the development of better treatments for PTSD. This review describes fear memory processes and their mechanisms and discusses the pros and cons of applying how this knowledge can be applied in the development of interventions for PTSD.","[Kida, Satoshi] Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Biosci, Fac Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Kida, Satoshi] Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Biosci, Fac Appl Biosci, Setagaya Ku, 1-1-1 Sakuragaoka, Tokyo 1568502, Japan",,"Kida, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Biosci, Fac Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan.; Kida, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Biosci, Fac Appl Biosci, Setagaya Ku, 1-1-1 Sakuragaoka, Tokyo 1568502, Japan.",kida@nodai.ac.jp,,,"KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H02488, 18H03944, 23300120, 20380078, 24650172, 26640014, 17K19464, 18022038, 22022039, 24116008, 24116001, 23115716, 17H06084, 17H05961, 17H05581, 18H05428, 18H05434]; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), JapanCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST); Science Research Promotion Fund; Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of JapanPromotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan; Sumitomo Foundation; Naito FoundationNaito Memorial Foundation; Uchara Memorial Foundation; Takcda Science Foundation, Japan","SK was supported by Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research (A) [KAKENHI; 15H02488, 18H03944], Scientific Research (B) [KAKENHI; 23300120, 20380078], and Challenging Exploratory Research [KAKENHI; 24650172, 26640014, 17K19464], Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research on Priority Areas-Molecular Brain Science-[KAKENHI; 18022038, 22022039], Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (research in a proposed research area) [KAKENHI; 24116008, 24116001, 23115716, 17H06084, 17H05961, 17H05581, 18H05428, 18H05434], Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan, The Science Research Promotion Fund, The Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan, The Sumitomo Foundation, The Naito Foundation, The Uchara Memorial Foundation, and the Takcda Science Foundation, Japan.",,74,43,45,3,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JAN,2019,236,1,,,,,49,57,,10.1007/s00213-018-5086-2,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,HL4IV,WOS:000458681900005,30374892,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022-04-16,

Although the pandemic affected people from all walks of life, irrespective of age or gender, the way the risk is perceived varies from one person to another. The pandemic risk reduction strategies can only be effective if individuals and communities respond positively to them, and for that, it is important to understand how the risk is perceived and responded to, differently by different groups of people. Gender plays a vital role in shaping risk perceptions and coping strategies, reflecting the predisposition of the public to accept health interventions and take precautionary measures. This study aims to understand the gender differences in COVID-19 risk perception and coping mechanisms ? Pakistan is selected as a case study area. Following on from designing the questionnaire, which included 40 indicators grouped into domains (four risk perception and three coping mechanisms domains), an online survey was conducted, and a sample of 389 respondents was collected (248 male and 141 female). An index-based approach was used to quantify risk perception and its domains (fear, behaviour, awareness, and trust), and likewise coping mechanisms and their domains (problem, emotion, and action). Statistical tests were employed to ascertain the differences among both genders, whereas regression modelling was used to measure the effect of gender on overall risk perception and coping mechanisms. Results reveal that perceived fear and trust varied significantly between Pakistani men and women, while coping mechanisms were also notably different between the two genders. Females were found to perceive risks higher, complied more with the government?s guidelines, and coped better than males in response to COVID-19. These findings imply that the gender aspect must be incorporated in designing effective communication and risk reduction strategies to efficiently address the current and potential future pandemic situations.","[Rana, Irfan Ahmad] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Bhatti, Saad Saleem] Ulster Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Coleraine, Londonderry, North Ireland; [Aslam, Atif Bilal] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept City & Reg Planning, Lahore, Pakistan; [Jamshed, Ali] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Spatial & Reg Planning IREUS, Stuttgart, Germany; [Ahmad, Junaid] Peshawar Med Coll, Prime Inst Publ Hlth, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China",,"Rana, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, H-12 Sect, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",irfanrana90@hotmail.com; s.bhatti@ulster.ac.uk; atif.aslam@uet.edu.pk; ali.jamshed@ireus.uni-stuttgart.de; jahmad@piph.prime.edu.pk; shahaa@cau.edu.cn,"Rana, Irfan Ahmad/C-2560-2017; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/AAT-7073-2021; Ahmad, Junaid/H-9891-2019; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/J-2476-2019","Rana, Irfan Ahmad/0000-0002-3157-1186; Shah, Ashfaq Ahmad/0000-0001-9142-2441; Ahmad, Junaid/0000-0002-8580-7529; Bhatti, Saad Saleem/0000-0002-1472-3731",,,,62,23,24,19,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Genetic variation in SLC18A2, the gene that encodes vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), has been reported to affect risk for the development of PTSD in humans. Here, we use transgenic mice that express either 5% (VMAT2-LO mice) or 200% (VMAT2-HI mice) of wild-type levels of VMAT2 protein. We report that VMAT2-LO mice have reduced VMAT2 protein in the hippocampus and amygdala, impaired monoaminergic vesicular storage capacity in both the striatum and frontal cortex, decreased monoamine metabolite abundance and a greatly reduced capacity to release dopamine upon stimulation. Furthermore, VMAT2-LO mice showed exaggerated cued and contextual fear expression, altered fear habituation, inability to discriminate threat from safety cues, altered startle response compared with wild-type mice and an anxiogenic-like phenotype, but displayed no deficits in social function. By contrast, VMAT2-HI mice exhibited increased VMAT2 protein throughout the brain, higher vesicular storage capacity and greater dopamine release upon stimulation compared with wild-type controls. Behaviorally, VMAT2-HI mice were similar to wild-type mice in most assays, with some evidence of a reduced anxiety-like responses. Together, these data show that presynaptic monoamine function mediates PTSD-like outcomes in our mouse model, and suggest a causal link between reduced VMAT2 expression and fear behavior, consistent with the correlational relationship between VMAT2 genotype and PTSD risk in humans. Targeting this system is a potential strategy for the development of pharmacotherapies for disorders like PTSD.","[Branco, Rachel C.; Burkett, James P.; Black, Carlie A.; Winokur, Emily; Elsworth, William; Dhamsania, Rohan K.; Lohr, Kelly M.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Schroeder, Jason P.; Weinshenker, David] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Atlanta, GA USA; [Jovanovic, Tanja] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Miller, Gary W.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Pharmacol,Dept Neurol,Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Branco, Rachel C.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biochem, South Bend, IN 46637 USA; [Burkett, James P.] Univ Toledo, Coll Med & Life Sci, Dept Neurosci, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Winokur, Emily] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Cognit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lohr, Kelly M.] Washington & Jefferson Coll, Dept Biol, Washington, PA 15301 USA; [Jovanovic, Tanja] Wayne State Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Detroit, MI 48201 USA",,"Miller, GW (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA.",gm2815@cumc.columbia.edu,,"Dhamsania, Rohan/0000-0003-3049-1704; Lohr, Kelly/0000-0002-0471-505X; Branco, Rachel/0000-0001-9655-4849","Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance of the National Institutes of Health [UL1TR002378]; National Institute of Environmental Health SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [5T32GM00860520, R01ES023839, T32ES012870]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [NS102306]; National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [DA038453, P30NS055077]","Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance of the National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: UL1TR002378; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Grant/Award Numbers: 5T32GM00860520, R01ES023839, T32ES012870; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Grant/Award Number: NS102306; National Institute on Drug Abuse, Grant/Award Numbers: DA038453, P30NS055077",,65,2,2,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1601-1848,1601-183X,,GENES BRAIN BEHAV,Genes Brain Behav.,JUN,2020,19,5,,,,,,,e12634,10.1111/gbb.12634,,JAN 2020,14,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,LY8UG,WOS:000506870500001,31898856,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-16,

Early intervention (e.g., debriefing) after psychological trauma is widely practiced and argued to be an effective strategy for limiting subsequent psychopathology, although there has been considerable debate on this point. Here we show in an animal model of traumatic fear that early intervention shortly after an aversive experience yields poor long-term fear reduction. Extinction trials administered minutes after aversive fear conditioning in rats suppressed fear acutely, but fear suppression was not maintained the next day. In contrast, delivering extinction trials 1 day after fear conditioning produced an enduring suppression of fear memory. We further show that the recent experience of an aversive event, not the timing of the extinction intervention per se, inhibits the development of long-term fear extinction. These results reveal that the level of fear present at the time of intervention is a critical factor in the efficacy of extinction. Importantly, our work suggests that early intervention may not yield optimal outcomes in reducing posttraumatic stress, particularly after severe trauma.","Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Neurosci Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Maren, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",maren@umich.edu,"Maren, Stephen/B-6182-2014; Maren, Stephen/A-7091-2009","Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411; Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411",NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH065961] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH065961] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,39,124,129,0,17,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

This approach is applied in a study on risks associated with Campylobacter on broiler meat. First, some web-based information interventions were designed and tested on participant motivation and intentions to cook more safely. Based on these self-reported measures, the intervention supported by the emotion disgust was selected as the most promising information intervention. Its effect on microbial cross-contamination was tested by recruiting a set of participants who prepared a salad with chicken breast fillet carrying a known amount of tracer bacteria. The amount of tracer that could be recovered from the salad revealed the transfer and survival of Campylobacter and was used as a measure of hygiene. This was introduced into an existing risk model on Campylobacter in the Netherlands to assess the effect of the information intervention both at the level of exposure and the level of human disease risk. We showed that the information intervention supported by the emotion disgust alone had no measurable effect on the health risk. However, when a behavioral cue was embedded within the instruction for the salad preparation, the risk decreased sharply. It is shown that a transdisciplinary approach, involving research on risk perception, microbiology, and risk assessment, is successful in evaluating the efficacy of an information intervention in terms of human health risks. The approach offers a novel tool for science-based risk management in the area of food safety.","[Nauta, Maarten J.; van Asselt, Esther D.; de Jong, Aarieke E.

Although much of this work has been done in rodents using Pavlovian fear conditioning, it may have important implications for fear memories in humans such as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent study suggested that cued fear memories, made labile by memory retrieval, were made additionally labile and thus more vulnerable to subsequent modification when mice inhaled 10% carbon dioxide (CO2) during retrieval. In light of this finding, we hypothesized that 10% CO2 inhalation soon after fear acquisition might affect memory recall 24 h later. We found that both cue and context fear memory were increased by CO2 exposure after fear acquisition. The effect of CO2 was time-dependent, as CO2 inhalation administered 1 or 4 h after cued fear acquisition increased fear memory, whereas CO2 inhalation 4 h before or 24 h after cued fear acquisition did not increase fear memory. The ability of CO2 exposure following acquisition to enhance fear memory was not a general consequence of stress, as restraining mice after acquisition did not alter cued fear memory. The memory-enhancing action of CO2 may be relatively specific to fear conditioning as novel object recognition was impaired by post-training CO2 inhalation. To explore the molecular underpinnings of these effects, we tested if they depended on the acid-sensing ion channel-1a (ASIC1A), a proton-gated cation channel that mediates other effects of CO2, likely via its ability to sense acidosis induced during CO2 inhalation. We found that CO2 inhalation did not alter cued or context fear memory in Asic1a(-/-) mice, suggesting that this phenomenon critically depends on ASIC1A. These results suggest that brain acidosis around the time of a traumatic event may enhance memory of the trauma, and may thus constitute an important risk factor for developing PTSD. Moreover, preventing peritraumatic acidosis might reduce risk of PTSD.","[Taugher, Rebecca J.; Wunsch, Amanda M.; Wang, Grace Z.; Chan, Aubrey C.; Wemmie, John A.] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Iowa City, IA 52240 USA; [Taugher, Rebecca J.; Wunsch, Amanda M.; Wang, Grace Z.; Chan, Aubrey C.; Wemmie, John A.] Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Chan, Aubrey C.; Dlouhy, Brian J.; Wemmie, John A.] Univ Iowa, Pappajohn Biomed Inst, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Chan, Aubrey C.; Dlouhy, Brian J.; Wemmie, John A.] Univ Iowa, Iowa Neurosci Inst, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Chan, Aubrey C.] Univ Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Dlouhy, Brian J.; Wemmie, John A.] Univ Iowa, Dept Neurosurg, Iowa City, IA USA; [Wemmie, John A.] Univ Iowa, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Wemmie, John A.] Univ Iowa, Roy J Carver Chair Psychiat & Neurosci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",,"Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Iowa City, IA 52240 USA.; Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.; Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Pappajohn Biomed Inst, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.; Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Iowa Neurosci Inst, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.; Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Neurosurg, Iowa City, IA USA.; Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.; Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Roy J Carver Chair Psychiat & Neurosci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",john-wemmie@uiowa.edu,,"Wemmie, John/0000-0001-7531-9065",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA,Funding This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health (MH-113325) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (BX004440).

Fear-related behaviors played an important role in shaping the outbreak. Fear-related behaviors are defined as individual or collective behaviors and actions initiated in response to fear reactions that are triggered by a perceived threat or actual exposure to a potentially traumatizing event. FRBs modify the future risk of harm. This review examines how fear-related behaviors were implicated in (1) accelerating the spread of Ebola, (2) impeding the utilization of life-saving Ebola treatment, (3) curtailing the availability of medical services for treatable conditions, (4) increasing the risks for new-onset psychological distress and psychiatric disorders, and (5) amplifying the downstream cascades of social problems. Fear-related behaviors are identified for each of these outcomes. Particularly notable are behaviors such as treating Ebola patients in home or private clinic settings, the laying of hands on Ebola-infected individuals to perform faith-based healing, observing hands-on funeral and burial customs, foregoing available life-saving treatment, and stigmatizing Ebola survivors and health professionals. Future directions include modeling the onset, operation, and perpetuation of fear-related behaviors and devising strategies to redirect behavioral responses to mass threats in a manner that reduces risks and promotes resilience.","[Shultz, James M.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Ctr Disaster & Extreme Event Preparedness DEEP Ct, 251 174 St 2319, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Cooper, Janice L.] Carter Ctr, Mental Hlth Program Liberia, Monrovia, CA, Liberia; [Baingana, Florence] Makerere Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Kampala, Uganda; [Oquendo, Maria A.; Wainberg, Milton L.; Neria, Yuval] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Oquendo, Maria A.; Wainberg, Milton L.; Neria, Yuval] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Espinel, Zelde] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Hlth, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Espinel, Zelde] Jackson Mem Hosp, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Althouse, Benjamin M.] Inst Dis Modeling, Bellevue, WA USA; [Althouse, Benjamin M.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Althouse, Benjamin M.] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Althouse, Benjamin M.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Marcelin, Louis Herns] Interuniv Inst Res & Dev INURED, Port Au Prince, Haiti; [Marcelin, Louis Herns] Univ Miami, Dept Anthropol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Towers, Sherry] Arizona State Univ, Simon A Levin Math Computat & Modeling Sci Ctr, Tempe, AZ USA; [Espinola, Maria] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Cincinnati, OH USA; [McCoy, Clyde B.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [McCoy, Clyde B.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Comprehens Drug Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Mazurik, Laurie] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Emergency Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rechkemmer, Andreas] Univ Denver, Grad Sch Social Work, Denver, CO USA",,"Shultz, JM (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Ctr Disaster & Extreme Event Preparedness DEEP Ct, 251 174 St 2319, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",jamesmichaelshultz@gmail.com; janice.cooper@cartercenter.org; kamayonza@gmail.com; mao4@columbia.edu; z.espinel@gmail.com; balthouse@intven.com; Lmarcel2@med.miami.edu; smtowers@asu.edu; maria.espinola@uc.edu; cmccoy@med.miami.edu; laurie.mazurik@cbrnecc.ca; mlw35@cumc.columbia.edu; ny126@columbia.edu; andreas.rechkemmer@du.edu,"Oquendo, Maria/AAC-6237-2019","Cooper, Janice/0000-0002-5343-9485; Wainberg, Milton/0000-0002-9390-4652",APA; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH096724] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Maria A.

The neural underpinnings of fear are clinically relevant but poorly understood. This study assessed fear potentiation and fear inhibition using fear-potentiated startle in a conditional discrimination procedure (AX+/BX-). We hypothesized that patients with PTSD would show normal fear potentiation and impaired fear inhibition. Subjects comprised 28 healthy volunteers and 27 PTSD patients (14 with low current symptoms, 13 with high current symptoms) who were presented with one set of colored lights (AX trials) paired with aversive air blasts to the throat, and a different series of lights (BX trials) presented without air blasts. We then presented A and B together (AB trials) to see whether B would inhibit fear potentiation to A. All groups showed robust fear potentiation in that they had significantly greater startle magnitude on AX trials than on noise-alone trials.

The basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) is considered an essential component of this conditional fear learning system. However, recent studies challenge this view and suggest that plasticity within other brain regions (i.e., central nucleus of the amygdala) may be crucial for fear conditioning. In the present study, we examine the mnemonic limits of contextual fear conditioning in the absence of the BLA using overtraining and by measuring remote fear memories. After excitotoxic lesions of the BLA were created, animals underwent overtraining and were tested at recent and remote memory intervals. Here we show that animals with BLA lesions can learn normal levels of fear. However, this fear memory loses its adaptive features: it is acquired slowly and shows substantial forgetting when remote memory is tested. Collectively, these findings suggest that fear-related plasticity acquired by brain regions outside of the BLA, unlike those acquired in the intact animals, do so for a relatively time-limited period.","[Poulos, Andrew M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Poulos, AM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",apoulos@ucla.edu,,,National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 62122]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062122] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant MH 62122 (to M.

In addition to testing the efficacy of CBM-I for contamination fear on various cognitive outcomes and emotional vulnerability, the current study examined whether the content of CBM-I must match a person's fear domain to be efficacious, and examined the moderating role of preexisting interpretation bias on CBM-I's efficacy. Participants (n = 121) high in contamination fear were assigned to one session of either CBM-I focused on contamination fear content, CBM-I focused on height fear content, or a sham control condition. Planned contrasts indicated that fear domain match does tend to enhance CBM-I's effects: compared to the heights condition, those in the contamination training condition improved on five of the eight cognitive bias-related variables, though there was no change on measures of emotional vulnerability. In contrast, there was little difference between the heights training and sham conditions. Minimal evidence was found for baseline interpretation bias as a moderator.

Deficient fear extinction is considered a robust clinical endophenotype for these disorders and, as such, has particular significance in the current age of RDoC (research domain criteria). Various rodent models of impaired extinction have thus been generated with the objective of approximating this clinical, relapse prone aberrant extinction learning. These models have helped to reveal neurobiological correlates of extinction circuitry failure, gene variants, and other mechanisms underlying deficient fear extinction. In addition, they are increasingly serving as tools to investigate ways to therapeutically overcome poor extinction to support long-term retention of extinction memory and thus protection against various forms of fear relapse; modeled in the laboratory by measuring spontaneous recovery, reinstatement and renewal of fear. In the current article, we review models of impaired extinction built around (1) experimentally induced brain region and neural circuit disruptions (2) spontaneously-arising and laboratory-induced genetic modifications, or (3) exposure to environmental insults, including stress, drugs of abuse, and unhealthy diet. Collectively, these models have been instrumental in advancing in our understanding of extinction failure and underlying susceptibilities at the neural, genetic, molecular, and neurochemical levels; generating renewed interest in developing novel, targeted and effective therapeutic treatments for anxiety and trauma-related disorders.","[Singewald, Nicolas] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Inst Pharm, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria; [Holmes, Andrew] NIAAA, Lab Behav & Genom Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA",,"Singewald, N (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Inst Pharm, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.",nicolas.singewald@uibk.ac.at,,"Singewald, Nicolas/0000-0002-0166-3370","Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF); FWF (Austrian Science Fund)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [I2433-B26, DK W-1206, SFB F4410]; NIAAA Intramural Research ProgramUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [ZIAAA000411] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Open access funding provided by Austrian Science Fund (FWF).

Despite the fact many of these disorders are more common in women than in men, the vast majority of work investigating fear conditioning in rodents has been conducted in males. The goal of the work presented here was to better understand how biological sex affects contextual fear conditioning and expression. To this end, rats of both sexes were trained to fear a specific context and fear responses were measured upon re-exposure to the conditioning context. In the first experiment, male and female rats were given context fear conditioning and tested the next day during which freezing behavior was measured. In the second experiment, rats were trained and tested in a similar fashion while fear-potentiated startle and defecation were measured. We found that males showed more freezing behavior than females during a fear expression test. The expression of fear-potentiated startle did not differ between sexes, while males exhibited more defecation during a test in a novel context. These data suggest that the expression of defensive behavior differs between sexes and highlight the importance of using multiple measures of fear when comparing between sexes.","[Russo, Amanda S.; Parsons, Ryan G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,"Parsons, RG (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",ryan.parsons@stonybrook.edu,,"Russo, Amanda/0000-0002-3436-0034",Stony Brook University; Stony Brook Foundation; U.S. National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21 MH121772],"This research was supported by startup funds from Stony Brook University, The Stony Brook Foundation, and grants R21 MH121772 (to RP) from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health).",,48,1,1,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

It is therefore crucial to develop an approach that persistently prevents the return of fear. Pavlovian fear-conditioning paradigms are commonly employed to create a controlled, novel fear association in the laboratory. After pairing an innocuous stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) with an aversive outcome (unconditioned stimulus, US) we can elicit a fear response (conditioned response, or CR) by presenting just the stimulus alone(1,2). Once fear is acquired, it can be diminished using extinction training, whereby the conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without the aversive outcome until fear is no longer expressed(3). This inhibitory learning creates a new, safe representation for the CS, which competes for expression with the original fear memory(4). Although extinction is effective at inhibiting fear, it is not permanent. Fear can spontaneously recover with the passage of time. Exposure to stress or returning to the context of initial learning can also cause fear to resurface(3,4). Our protocol addresses the transient nature of extinction by targeting the reconsolidation window to modify emotional memory in a more permanent manner. Ample evidence suggests that reactivating a consolidated memory returns it to a labile state, during which the memory is again susceptible to interference(5-9). This window of opportunity appears to open shortly after reactivation and close approximately 6hrs later(5,11,16), although this may vary depending on the strength and age of the memory(15). By allowing new information to incorporate into the original memory trace, this memory may be updated as it reconsolidates(10,11). Studies involving non-human animals have successfully blocked the expression of fear memory by introducing pharmacological manipulations within the reconsolidation window, however, most agents used are either toxic to humans or show equivocal effects when used in human studies(12-14). Our protocol addresses these challenges by offering an effective, yet non-invasive, behavioral manipulation that is safe for humans. By prompting fear memory retrieval prior to extinction, we essentially trigger the reconsolidation process, allowing new safety information (i.e., extinction) to be incorporated while the fear memory is still susceptible to interference. A recent study employing this behavioral manipulation in rats has successfully blocked fear memory using these temporal parameters(11). Additional studies in humans have demonstrated that introducing new information after the retrieval of previously consolidated motor(16), episodic(17), or declarative(18) memories leads to interference with the original memory trace(14). We outline below a novel protocol used to block fear recovery in humans.","[Schiller, Daniela] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Schiller, Daniela] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Schiller, Daniela] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY USA; [Raio, Candace M.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Schiller, D (corresponding author), Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10029 USA.",daniela.schiller@mssm.edu; liz.phelps@nyu.edu,"Schiller, Daniela/Q-2431-2018","Schiller, Daniela/0000-0002-0357-7724","James S.

Due to the absence of conditioning studies assessing generalization in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), results of this meta-analysis do not reveal whether such generalization abnormalities also apply to GAD. The current study fills this gap by behaviorally and psychophysiologically assessing levels of conditioned fear generalization across adults with and without GAD. Methods: Twenty-two patients with a DSM-IV-Text Revision diagnosis of GAD and 26 healthy comparison subjects were recruited and tested. The employed generalization paradigm consisted of quasi-randomly presented rings of gradually increasing size, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+) and conditioned safety cues. The rings of intermediary size served as generalization stimuli, creating a continuum of similarity between CS+ and conditioned safety cues across which to assess response slopes, referred to as generalization gradients. Primary outcome variables included slopes for fear-potentiated startle (electromyography) and self-reported risk ratings. Results: Behavioral and psychophysiological findings demonstrated overgeneralization of conditioned fear among patients with GAD. Specifically, generalization gradients were abnormally shallow among GAD patients, reflecting less degradation of the conditioned fear response as the presented stimulus differentiated from the CS+. Conclusions: Overgeneralization of conditioned fear to safe encounters resembling feared situations may contribute importantly to the psychopathology of GAD by proliferating anxiety cues in the individual's environment that are then capable of evoking and maintaining anxiety and worry associated with GAD.","[Lissek, Shmuel; Geraci, Marilla; Pine, Daniel S.; Grillon, Christian] NIMH, Intramural Res Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lissek, Shmuel; Kaczkurkin, Antonia N.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Rabin, Stephanie] Drexel Univ, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Lissek, S (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Elliott Hall,75 East River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",smlissek@umn.edu,"Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019","Lissek, Shmuel/0000-0001-7384-371X; Rabin, Stephanie/0000-0002-8282-0867","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R00MH080130, ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R00 MH080130, K99 MH080130] Funding Source: Medline",,,23,219,229,7,67,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Here we sought to determine if individual differences in Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), a potential risk factor for anxiety disorders, underlies compromised fear extinction. We tested this hypothesis by recording electrodermal activity in 38 healthy participants during fear acquisition and extinction. We assessed the temporality of fear extinction, by examining early and late extinction learning. During early extinction, low IU was associated with larger skin conductance responses to learned threat vs. safety cues, whereas high IU was associated with skin conductance responding to both threat and safety cues, but no cue discrimination. During late extinction, low IU showed no difference in skin conductance between learned threat and safety cues, whilst high IU predicted continued fear expression to learned threat, indexed by larger skin conductance to threat vs. safety cues. These findings suggest a critical role of uncertainty-based mechanisms in the maintenance of learned fear. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Inappropriate inflammation is also emerging as a risk factor for trauma-related, anxiety, and affective disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized as persistent re-experiencing of the trauma after a traumatic experience. Traumatic experiences can lead to long-lasting fear memories and exaggerated fear potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex. The acoustic startle reflex is an ethologically relevant reflex and can be potentiated in both humans and rats through Pavlovian conditioning. Mycobacterium vaccae NCTC 11659 is a soil-derived bacterium with immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties that has been demonstrated to confer stress resilience in mice. Here we immunized adult male Sprague Dawley rats 3x, once per week, with a heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae NCTC 11659 (0.1 mg, s.c., in 100 mu l borate-buffered saline) or vehicle, and, then, 3 weeks following the final immunization, tested them in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm; controls were maintained under home cage control conditions throughout the experiment (n = 11-12 per group). Rats were tested on days 1 and 2 for baseline acoustic startle, received fear conditioning on days 3 and 4, and underwent fear extinction training on days 5-10. Rats were euthanized on day 11 and brain tissue was sectioned for analysis of mRNA expression for genes important in control of brain serotonergic signaling, including tph2, htrla, slc6a4, and slc22a3, throughout the brainstem dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Immunization with M. vaccae had no effect on baseline acoustic startle or fear expression on day 5. However, M. vaccae-immunized rats showed enhanced between-session and within-session extinction on day 6, relative to vehicle immunized controls. Immunization with M. vaccae and fear-potentiated startle altered serotonergic gene expression in a gene- and subregion-specific manner. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that immunoregulatory strategies, such as preimmunization with M. vaccae, have potential for prevention of stress- and trauma-related psychiatric disorders.

Synaptic plasticity in the neocortex, dHipp, ventral Hipp (vHipp), and BLA has also been implicated in fear and extinction memory. This finding raises the possibility that basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons, the predominant source of acetylcholine in these brain regions, have an important role in mediating fear and extinction memory. While empirical studies support this hypothesis, there are interesting inconsistencies among these studies that raise questions about how best to define the role of BF cholinergic neurons in fear and extinction memory. Nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA are critical for fear memory and contextual fear extinction memory. NBM cholinergic neurons that project to the neocortex are critical for cued and contextual fear conditioned suppression, but are not critical for fear memory in other behavioral paradigms and in the inhibitory avoidance paradigm may even inhibit contextual fear memory formation. Medial septum and diagonal band of Broca cholinergic neurons are critical for contextual fear memory and acquisition of cued fear extinction. Thus, even though the results of previous studies suggest BF cholinergic neurons modulate fear and extinction memory, inconsistent findings among these studies necessitates more research to better define the neural circuits and molecular processes through which BF cholinergic neurons modulate fear and extinction memory. Furthermore, studies determining if BF cholinergic neurons can be manipulated in such a manner so as to treat excessive fear in anxiety disorders are needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Research has examined how fear associated with specific intergroup relations interferes with how individuals relate to in-group and out-group members. However, we know relatively little about how intergroup relations might be affected by incidental emotions. We tested how incidental fear affects empathy toward in-group and out-group members.

However, little is known about how the US (pain) inputs are relayed to the basolateral amygdala. The present studies were designed to define potential US pathways to the amygdala using lesion methods. Electrolytic lesions before or after training were placed in caudal granular/dysgranular insular cortex (IC) alone or in conjunction with the posterior intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (PoT/PIL), and the effects on fear conditioning were examined. Pretraining lesions of both IC and PoT/PIL, but not lesions of le alone, blocked the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle. However, post-training combined lesions of IC and PoT/PIL did not prevent expression of conditioned fear. Given that previous studies have shown that lesions of PoT/PIL alone had no effect on acquisition of conditioned fear, these results suggest that two parallel cortical (insula-amygdala) and subcortical (PoT/PIL-amygdala) pathways are involved in relaying shock information to the basolateral amygdala during fear conditioning.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06508 USA",,"Shi, CJ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1636 Pierce Dr,Suite 4000, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH047840, R01MH047840, R01MH057250] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH-57250, MH-00004, MH-47840] Funding Source: Medline",,,59,200,207,0,16,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Various lines of evidence indicate that reactivation of these memories renders them labile which offers a potential time-window for intervention. We tested in non-human primates whether ketamine, administered during fear memory reactivation, affected passive (inhibitory) avoidance learning. For the consolidation of contextual emotional memory, the unescapable foot-shock paradigm in a passive avoidance task with two compartments (dark vs illuminated) was used. After entering the dark compartment, marmoset monkeys received four random foot-shocks (1 mA, 4 s) within 15-min. This stressful exposure increased the saliva cortisol and heart rate and impaired REM-sleep ( p < 0.05). One week later the monkeys were re-exposed to the stressful situation for the reconsolidation of the fearful experience. During the re-exposure the monkeys were treated with ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline. In week 3, the monkeys were placed in the experimental setting to test their memory for the fearful experience. In contrast to the vehicle-treated monkeys, who avoided the dark compartment, the ketamine-treated monkeys entered the dark compartment that was previously associated with the fearful experience ( p < 0.05). Post-mortem analysis of the hippocampus showed that ketamine-treated animals exhibited less doublecortin positive neurons and BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus. This study reveals that a single low dose of ketamine, administered upon fear retrieval in monkeys, reduce contextual fear memory and attenuate neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These are important findings for considering ketamine as a potential candidate to target traumatic memories in PTSD. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the downstream neural circuits that mediate these fear responses differ according to the nature of the threat, with separate pathways having been identified for predator, conspecific and physically harmful threats. In particular, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VHMdm) is critical for the expression of defensive responses to predators. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this circuit also participates in predator fear memory by transient pharmacogenetic inhibition of the VMHdm and its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, during predator fear learning in the mouse. Our data demonstrate that neural activity in the VMHdm is required for both the acquisition and recall of predator fear memory, whereas that of its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, is required only for the acute expression of fear.

These issues were at the heart of presentations by Paul Chapman, Michael Fanselow, Patricia Shinnick-Gallagher, and Michael Rogawski in a session entitled Long-Term Plasticity in Amygdala Synaptic Transmission that was held at the conference featured in this volume. In this chapter, I briefly summarize these talks and give my perspective on the presentations as the session chair. I argue that we must first understand the role of the amygdala in learning and memory in order to understand the contribution of amygdaloid synaptic plasticity to behavior. Although it is generally agreed that the amygdala is involved in several forms of emotional learning and memory such as pavlovian fear conditioning, a recent debate has emerged concerning the precise role of the amygdala in learning versus performing fear responses. I discuss data from my laboratory that unravel this issue. I argue that the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) normally plays an essential role in associative processes in fear conditioning. Nonetheless, rats with BLA lesions acquire and express conditional fear under some conditions. A neuroanatomical model that accounts for these data is presented.","Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ Michigan, Program Neurosci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Maren, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 525 E Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Maren, Stephen/A-7091-2009; anand, amit/A-7222-2009; Maren, Stephen/B-6182-2014","Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411; Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R29MH057865] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R29MH57865] Funding Source: Medline,,,13,99,102,0,4,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-404-8,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2003,985,,,,,,106,113,,,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,BW71H,WOS:000182918800009,12724152,,,,2022-04-16,

However, the specific role of these amygdalar nuclei in predator odor-induced fear memory is not known. Therefore, fiber-sparing lesions or temporary inactivation of the BLA or MeA were made either prior to or after exposure to cat odor, and conditioned contextual fear behavior was examined the next day. BLA and MeA lesions produced significant reductions in cat odor-induced unconditioned and conditioned fear-related behavior. In addition, temporary pharmacological neural inactivation methods occurring after exposure to cat odor revealed subtle behavioral alterations indicative of a role of the BLA in fear memory consolidation but not memory retrieval. In contrast, the MeA appears to play a specific role in retrieval but not consolidation. Results show that the BLA participates in the conditioned and unconditioned cat odor stimulus association that underlies fear memory, underscore a novel role of the MeA in predator odor contextual conditioning, and demonstrate different roles of the BLA and MeA in modulating consolidation and retrieval of predator odor fear memory.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Psychol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,"Takahashi, LK (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Psychobiol Lab, 2430 Campus Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",lkt@hawaii.edu,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R25GM056930] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [U54NS039406] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [5 R25 GM56930-07] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [NS 39406] Funding Source: Medline,,,34,67,68,1,13,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

Half of the participants in each group were instructed after the completion of acquisition that no more unconditional stimuli were to be presented. Extinction of differential electrodermal responses required more trials after training with fear-relevant pictures. Moreover, there was some evidence that verbal instructions did not affect extinction of second interval electrodermal responses to fear-relevant pictures.

Birds were subjected to the following treatments: (i) received no physical or visual contact with humans (control); (ii) from d 1 to 28, chicks were individually stroked gently for 30 s once daily (PL); (iii) from d 1 to 28, chicks were picked up individually, suspended by both legs, exposed to recorded noise, and swung gently for 15 s once daily (UNPL); (iv) from d 1 to 14 and from d 15 to 28, chicks were subjected to PL and UNPL, respectively (PL-UNPL); and (v) from d 1 to 14 and from d 15 to 28, chicks were subjected to UNPL and PL, respectively (UNPL-PL). On d 42, birds from each treatment group were road-transported for 3 h. Heat shock protein (hsp) 70 expression, plasma levels of corticosterone, serum creatine kinase concentration, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios (HLR), and tonic immobility duration were determined pre- and posttransit. There were significant (P < 0.05) duration of transportation x human contact treatment interactions for HLR and hsp 70 density. Following transit, the PL chicks had significantly (P < 0.05) lower HLR and greater hsp 70 density than the other groups. The corticosterone of PL and UNPL chicks were lower than their control, PL-UNPL, and UNPL-PL counterparts. The PL and PL-UNPL treatments were effective in shortening tonic immobility duration significantly (P < 0.05). Except for UNPL-PL, the serum creatine kinase activity of PL was significantly lower than the other groups. In conclusion, subjecting birds to pleasant human contact reduced stress and fear reactions to transportation by enhancing the ability to express hsp 70 in the brain. Unpleasant human contact had adverse effect on the birds' response to transportation. Early age pleasant experience with humans failed to negate the adverse effects of subsequent unpleasant contact.","[Al-Aqil, A.; Zulkifli, I.; Sazili, A.

Fear acquisition refers to learning to discriminate between threat and safety cues. Extinction learning reflects the formation of a new inhibitory-memory that competes with a previously learned threat-related memory. Adjudicating the competition between threat memory and the new inhibitory memory during extinction may rely, in part, on cognitive processes such as working memory (WM). Despite significant shared neural circuits and signaling pathways the relationship between WM, fear acquisition, and extinction is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed data from a large sample of healthy Marines who underwent an assessment battery including tests of fear acquisition, extinction learning, and WM (N-back). Fear potentiated startle (FPS), fear expectancy ratings, and self-reported anxiety served as the primary dependent variables. High WM ability (N = 192) was associated with greater CS + fear inhibition during the late block of extinction and greater US expectancy change during extinction learning compared to individuals with low WM ability (N = 204). WM ability was not associated with magnitude of fear conditioning/expression. Attention ability was unrelated to fear acquisition or extinction supporting specificity of WM associations with extinction. These results support the conclusion that individual differences in WM may contribute to regulating fear responses.","[Stout, Daniel M.; Acheson, Dean T.; Baker, Dewleen G.; Risbrough, Victoria B.] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, Ctr Excellence Stress & Mental Hlth, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Stout, Daniel M.; Acheson, Dean T.; Baker, Dewleen G.; Geyer, Mark A.; Risbrough, Victoria B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Moore, Tyler M.; Gur, Ruben C.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Brain Behav Lab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Gur, Ruben C.] Philadelphia Vet Adm Med Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Geyer, Mark A.; MRS Team] VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, Res Serv, San Diego, CA 92161 USA",,"Risbrough, VB (corresponding author), Dept Psychiat, 9500 Gilman Dr,Mail Code 0804, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",vrisbrough@ucsd.edu,"Risbrough, Victoria/X-3344-2019; Baker, Dewleen/O-4957-2019; Gur, Ruben/K-1999-2019","Baker, Dewleen/0000-0002-1736-9838; Gur, Ruben/0000-0002-9657-1996; Moore, Tyler/0000-0002-1384-0151","The Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery [N62645-11-C-4037]; VA Center of Excellence; VA Merit AwardUS Department of Veterans Affairs; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH089983, MH019112, MH096891, MH042228]; Dowshen Program for Neuroscience; Office of Academic Affiliations, Advanced Fellowship Program in Mental Illness Research and Treatment, Department of Veterans Affairs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH096891, T32MH019112] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01BX002558] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (N62645-11-C-4037) (DGB, VBR) and the VA Center of Excellence supported this work for Stress and Mental Health (DMS, DTA, DGB, VBR).

The ability to reduce or extinguish fear-related memories may be altered in patients with PTSD and it is possible that nicotine modulates this. Although there are numerous studies examining the effects of nicotine on acquisition of fear learning, the effects of nicotine on extinction of contextual fear are not well understood. In the present study, we examined the effects of acute nicotine (0.18 mg/kg) on extinction of contextual fear in C57BL/6 J mice. Animals were first trained in a background contextual fear conditioning paradigm using a white noise as a conditioned stimulus (CS), which coterminated with a 2 s 0.57 mA unconditioned foot-shock stimulus (US). Animals were then administered either nicotine or saline and exposed to either the training context or a novel context in order to measure freezing to the context during extinction. Our results demonstrate that nicotine administration during extinction delays extinction of contextual freezing while nicotine did not affect cued freezing or freezing to the novel context.

Patients and Methods After meeting stringent enrollment criteria for an AS cohort study at a single tertiary care cancer centre, 180 men with favourable-risk prostate cancer completed questionnaires at the time of enrollment and every 6 months for up to 30 months. Questionnaires assessed illness uncertainty, anxiety, prostate-specific QoL (using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] scale) and general QoL (using the 12-time short-form health survey [SF-12]) and fear of progression. We used linear mixed-model analyses and multilevel mediation analyses. Results Sexual scores on the EPIC scale significantly declined over time (P < 0.05). Illness uncertainty was a significant predictor of all EPIC summary scores, SF-12 physical component summary (PCS) scores, mental component summary (MCS) scores and fear of progression scores (all P < 0.05), after controlling for demographic and clinicopathological factors. Anxiety predicted all EPIC summary, MCS and fear of progression scores (all P < 0.05) but not PCS scores (P = 0.08). Scores on PCS, MCS, EPIC summary scales (except sexual scale), and fear of progression did not change significantly over the study period (all P > 0.10). Conclusion Over the 2.5-year follow-up, QoL remained stable; only sexual function scores significantly declined. Illness uncertainty and anxiety were significant predictors of general and prostate-specific QoL and fear of progression. Interventions to reduce uncertainty and anxiety may enhance QoL for men with prostate cancer on AS.","[Parker, Patricia A.; Davis, John W.; Baum, George; Wang, Xuemei; Ward, John F.; Kuban, Deborah; Frank, Steven J.; Lee, Andrew K.; Logothetis, Christopher J.; Kim, Jeri] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Latini, David M.] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Latini, David M.] Michael E DeBakey VA Med Ctr, Houston, TX USA",,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Genitourinary Med Oncol, 1515 Holcombe Blvd,Unit 1374, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",jekim@mdanderson.org,"Ward, John F/AAS-3393-2020","Ward, John F/0000-0001-6027-8774; Latini, David/0000-0002-6161-4861; Frank, Steven/0000-0001-6517-7884",Cancer Center Core Grant from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center [P30CA 16672]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA016672] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This study was supported in part by Cancer Center Core Grant P30CA 16672 from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Whereas it is well established that glucocorticoids are released in fearful situations, it is not known whether these hormones, in turn, modulate perceived fear. As extensive evidence indicates that elevated glucocorticoid levels impair the retrieval of emotionally arousing information, they might also inhibit retrieval of fear memory associated with phobia and, thereby, reduce phobic fear. Here, we investigated whether acutely administrated glucocorticoids reduced phobic fear in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 40 subjects with social phobia and 20 subjects with spider phobia. In the social phobia study, cortisone (25 mg) administered orally 1 h before a socio-evaluative stressor significantly reduced self-reported fear during the anticipation, exposure, and recovery phase of the stressor. Moreover, the stress-induced release of cortisol in placebo-treated subjects correlated negatively with fear ratings, suggesting that endogenously released cortisol in the context of a phobic situation buffers fear symptoms. In the spider phobia study, repeated oral administration of cortisol (10 mg), but not placebo, 1 h before exposure to a spider photograph induced a progressive reduction of stimulus-induced fear. This effect was maintained when subjects were exposed to the stimulus again 2 days after the last cortisol administration, suggesting that cortisol may also have facilitated the extinction of phobic fear. Cortisol treatment did not reduce general, phobia-unrelated anxiety. In conclusion, the present findings in two distinct types of phobias indicate that glucocorticoid administration reduces phobic fear.","Univ Zurich, Div Psychiat Res, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Inst Psychol, Dept Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Munich, Dept Anaesthesiol, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ctr Neurobiol Learning & Memory, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"de Quervain, DJF (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Div Psychiat Res, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",quervain@bli.unizh.ch,"Roozendaal, Benno/B-8403-2013","de Quervain, Dominique/0000-0001-7131-2464",,,,48,263,266,1,34,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Greater dissimilarity yields weaker behavioral responses, forming a fear-tuning profile. The perceptual model of fear generalization assumes that behavioral fear tuning results from perceptual similarities, suggesting that brain responses should also exhibit the same fear-tuning profile. Using fMRI and a circular fear-generalization procedure, we tested this prediction. In contrast with the perceptual model, insula responses showed less generalization than behavioral responses and encoded the aversive quality of the conditioned stimulus, as shown by high pattern similarity between the conditioned stimulus and the shock. Also inconsistent with the perceptual model, object-sensitive visual areas responded to ambiguity-related outcome uncertainty. Together these results indicate that fear generalization is not passively driven by perception, but is an active process integrating threat identification and ambiguity-based uncertainty to orchestrate a flexible, adaptive fear response.","[Onat, Selim; Buechel, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany",,"Onat, S (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany.",sonat@uke.de,,"Onat, Selim/0000-0002-4782-5603",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [SFB TRR 58],"We thank S.

Cued fear conditioning, extinction, restatement, and systematic manipulations of the underlying brain amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, represent key experimental paradigms to study such processes. Numerous empirical studies have revealed several aspects and the neural systems and plasticity underlying them, but at the moment we lack a comprehensive view. Here we propose a computational model based on firing rate leaky units that contributes to such integration by accounting for 25 different experiments on fear conditioning, extinction, and restatement, on the basis of a single neural architecture having a structure and plasticity grounded in known brain biology. This allows the model to furnish three novel contributions to understand these open issues: (a) the functioning of the central and lateral amygdala system supporting conditioning; (b) the role played by the endocannabinoids system in within- and between-session extinction; (c) the formation of three important types of neurons underlying fear processing, namely fear, extinction, and persistent neurons.

These effects have highlighted Epo as a candidate for treatment of psychiatric disease including schizophrenia and depression. The current study aimed to explore the effects of Epo on neural and behavioral measures of emotional processing relevant for depression and the effects of conventional antidepressant medication. Methods: In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the effects of Epo (40,000 IU) versus saline on the neural processing of happy and fearful faces in 23 healthy volunteers. Facial expression recognition was assessed outside the scanner. Results: One week after administration, Epo reduced neural response to fearful versus neutral faces in the occipito-parietal cortex consistent with reduced attention to fear. Erythropoietin additionally reduced recognition of fearful facial expressions without affecting recognition of other emotional expressions. These actions occurred in the absence of changes in hematological parameters. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that Epo directly modulates brain responses to emotional information in humans in a manner consistent with the actions of conventional antidepressants. The characterization of the effects of Epo in a clinically depressed group is therefore warranted.","Univ Oxford, Warneford Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England; Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX3 7JX, England",,"Miskowiak, K (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Warneford Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England.",kamilia.miskowiak@psy.ox.ac.uk,,"Miskowiak, Kamilla/0000-0003-2572-1384; Harmer, Catherine/0000-0002-1609-8335",,,,46,36,38,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

The adaptive response also requires proper interpretation of the current context. In fear behaviors, social signals have bidirectional effects-some cues elicit or enhance fear whereas other suppress or buffer it. Studies on the social facilitation and social buffering of fear provide evidence of competition between social cues of opposing meanings. Co-expression of opposing cues by the same animal may explain the contradicting outcomes from the interaction between naive and frightened conspecifics, which reflect the fine balance between fear facilitation and buffering. The neuronal mechanisms that determine that balance provide an exciting target for future studies to probe the brain circuits underlying social modulation of emotional behaviors.","[Morozov, Alexei; Ito, Wataru] Virginia Tech, Caril Res Inst, Roanoke, VA USA; [Morozov, Alexei] Virginia Tech, Sch Biomed Engn & Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Morozov, Alexei] Virginia Tech, Caril Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Med, 2 Riverside Circle, Roanoke, VA 24016 USA",,"Morozov, A (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Caril Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Med, 2 Riverside Circle, Roanoke, VA 24016 USA.",alexeim@vtc.vt.edu,,"Morozov, Alexei/0000-0003-0495-3987; Ito, Wataru/0000-0002-5631-8267","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH107970]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH107970, R21MH112093] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Number: R21MH107970",,65,3,3,7,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1601-1848,1601-183X,,GENES BRAIN BEHAV,Genes Brain Behav.,JAN,2019,18,1,,,,,,,e12491,10.1111/gbb.12491,,,8,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,HI8LR,WOS:000456707900001,29896766,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2022-04-16,

There are uncertainties in the traditional human error risk assessment (e.g. HECA) due to the uncertainties and imprecisions in Human Error Probability (HEP), Error-Effect Probability (EEP) and Error Consequence Severity (ECS). While fuzzy logic can deal with uncertainty and imprecision. It is an efficient tool for solving problems where knowledge uncertainty may occur. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new Fuzzy Human Error Risk Assessment Methodology (FHERAM) for determining Human Error Risk Importance (HERI) as a function of HEP, EEP and ECS. The modeling technique is based on the concept of fuzzy logic, which offers a convenient way of representing the relationships between the inputs (i.e. HEP, EEP, and ECS) and outputs (i.e. HERI) of a risk assessment system in the form of IF THEN rules. It is implemented on fuzzy logic toolbox of MATLAB using Mamdani techniques. A case example is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. Results show that the method is more realistic than the traditional ones, and it is practicable and valuable. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

There were three independent variables controlled: evaluation from robot (evaluative vs. non-evaluative robot), users' FNE (low FNE vs. high FNE), and gaze from robot (refrained gazes vs. normal gazes), and dependent variables were participants' preferences of the robot as subjective measures and amount of utterances as an objective measure. The experimental results suggested that when the robot evaluated participants with a lower FNE, they preferred to use the robot with normal gaze behavior more than those with a higher FNE. While the effect of refrained gaze is not clear for people with higher FNE, for people with lower FNE, refrained gaze reduced their intention to participate when the robot evaluated them. Moreover, the experimental results suggested that persons having higher FNE tend to trust the robot more, and participants spoke more when the robot did not evaluate them and when it used the normal gaze.

Great concern has arisen over the continued infection of humans with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype. Ongoing human exposure potentially increases the risk that a pandemic virus strain will emerge that is easily transmissible among humans. Although the pathogenicity of a pandemic strain cannot be predicted, the high mortality seen in documented H5N1 human infections thus far has raised the level of concern. Objectives. To define the three types of influenza that can affect humans, discuss potential exposure risks at the human-animal interface, and suggest ways to reduce exposure and help prevent development of a pandemic virus. Methods. This review is based on data and guidelines available from the World Health Organization, the scientific literature, and official governmental reports. Results. Epidemiological data on human exposure risk are generally incomplete. Transmission of HPAI to humans is thought to occur through contact with respiratory secretions, feces, contaminated feathers, organs, and blood from live or dead infected birds and possibly from contaminated surfaces. Consumption of properly cooked poultry and eggs is not thought to pose a risk. Use Of antiviral containment and vaccination may protect against development of a pandemic. Conclusions. To most effectively decrease the risk of a pandemic, the public health and animal health sectors-those which are responsible for protecting and improving the health of humans and animals, respectively-must collaborate to decrease human exposure to HPAI virus, both by controlling virus circulation among poultry and by assessing the risks of human exposure to avian influenza virus at the human-animal interface from primary production through consumption of poultry and poultry products, and implementing risk-based mitigation measures.","WHO Global Influenza Programme, Dept Epidem & Pandem Alert & Response, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland; WHO, Dept Food Safety Zoonoses & Foodborne Dis, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland",,"Perdue, M (corresponding author), WHO Global Influenza Programme, Dept Epidem & Pandem Alert & Response, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.",perduem@who.int,,"Mumford, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9548-9675",,,,38,19,21,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0379-5721,1564-8265,,FOOD NUTR BULL,Food Nutr.

The knowledge in neuronal mechanisms of extinction is fundamental in the treatment of anxiety and fear disorders. Interestingly, the use of pharmacological compounds that reduce anxiety and fear has been shown as a potent co-adjuvant in extinction therapy. However, the efficiency and mechanisms by which pharmacological compounds promote extinction of fear memories remains still largely unknown and would benefit from a validation based on functional neuronal circuits, and the neurotransmitters that modulate them. From this perspective, oxytocin receptor signaling, which has been shown in cortical and limbic areas to modulate numerous functions (Eliava et al. Neuron 89(6):1291-1304, 2016), among them fear and anxiety circuits, and to enhance the salience of social stimuli (Stoop Neuron 76(1):142-59, 2012), may offer an interesting perspective. Experiments in animals and humans suggest that oxytocin could be a promising pharmacological agent at adjusting memory consolidation to boost fear extinction. Additionally, it is possible that long-term changes in endogenous oxytocin signaling can also play a role in reducing expression of fear at different brain targets. In this review, we summarize the effects reported for oxytocin in cortico-limbic circuits and on fear behavior that are of relevance for the modulation and potential extinction of fear memories.","[Triana-Del Rio, Rodrigo; van den Burg, Erwin; Stoop, Ron; Hegoburu, Chloe] CHU Vaudois, Ctr Psychiat Neurosci, Lab Neurobiol Emot, Lausanne, Switzerland",,"Hegoburu, C (corresponding author), CHU Vaudois, Ctr Psychiat Neurosci, Lab Neurobiol Emot, Lausanne, Switzerland.",chloe.hegoburu@gmail.com,,,Synapsis Foundation; Swiss Federal grant from the Commission of Technology and Innovation; Marie-Heim Vogtlin grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation,"RT is supported by the Synapsis Foundation, CH by a Marie-Heim Vogtlin grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation, and EvdB by a Swiss Federal grant from the Commission of Technology and Innovation.",,208,15,15,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JAN,2019,236,1,,,,,339,354,,10.1007/s00213-018-5030-5,,,16,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,HL4IV,WOS:000458681900026,30302511,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-16,

Using a rodent model of stress-based susceptibility to PTSD, we investigated the role of serotonin in this phenomenon. METHODS: Adult mice were exposed to repeated immobilization stress or handling, and the role of serotonin in subsequent fear learning was assessed using pharmacologic manipulation and western blot detection of serotonin receptors, measurements of serotonin, high-speed optogenetic silencing, and behavior. RESULTS: Both dorsal raphe serotonergic activity during aversive reinforcement and amygdala serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) activity during memory consolidation were necessary for stress enhancement of fear memory, but neither process affected fear memory in unstressed mice. Additionally, prior stress increased amygdala sensitivity to serotonin by promoting surface expression of 5-HT2CR without affecting tissue levels of serotonin in the amygdala. We also showed that the serotonin that drives stress enhancement of associative cued fear memory can arise from paired or unpaired footshock, an effect not predicted by theoretical models of associative learning. CONCLUSIONS: Stress bolsters the consequences of aversive reinforcement, not by simply enhancing the neurobiological signals used to encode fear in unstressed animals, but rather by engaging distinct mechanistic pathways.

Environmental exposure has been largely studied, providing to date a realistic picture of the degree of contamination of the environment by pharmaceuticals and hormones. Conversely, little information is available regarding human exposure. NSAIDS, carbamazepine, iodinated contrast media, beta-blockers, antibiotics have been detected in drinking water, mostly in the range of ng/L. it is questioned if such concentrations may affect human health. Currently, no consensus among the scientific community exists on what risk, if any, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors pose to human health. Future European research will focus, on one hand, on genotoxic and cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs and, on the other hand, on the induction of genetic resistance by antibiotics. This review does not aim to give a comprehensive overview of human health risk of drug residues and endocrine disruptors in drinking water but rather highlight important topics of discussion.

The hippocampus and amygdala are widely believed to be essential for fear conditioning to contexts and discrete cues, respectively. Indeed, this parsing of function within the fear circuit has been used to leverage fear conditioning as a behavioral assay of hippocampal and amygdala function, particularly in transgenic mouse models. Recent work, however, blurs the anatomical segregation of cue and context conditioning and challenges the necessity for the hippocampus and amygdala in fear learning. Moreover, nonassociative factors may influence the performance of fear responses under a variety of conditions. Caution must therefore be exercised when using fear conditioning as a behavioral assay for hippocampal- and amygdala-dependent learning.","[Maren, Stephen] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Maren, Stephen] Univ Michigan, Neurosci Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Maren, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",maren@umich.edu,"Maren, Stephen/B-6182-2014; Maren, Stephen/A-7091-2009","Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411; Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01MH065961, R01MH073655]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH065961, R01MH073655] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This study was supported by the NIH (R01MH065961; R01MH073655).,,79,177,179,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0953-816X,1460-9568,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

These enhancements led to formulation of a new overall system risk-reliability score. Background: Many system safety analysis methods focus on individual physical component failure. Some human reliability analyses (HRA) consider human-automation interaction in determining system failure rates. There is no system safety analysis technique that quantifies the impact of human and automation reliability on the risk of hazard exposure. Method: Classification of the probability and severity of hazard exposure is typically made in terms of linguistic rather than numerical variables. Fuzzy sets are applicable for transforming linguistic classifications to numerical quantities. We focused on using fuzzy sets to define overlapping bands of system risk exposure with reference to the hazard risk categories defined in MIL-STD 882B. Fuzzy sets were also used for human-automated system reliability classification. Results: Introduction of human and automation reliability assessment in the SHA allows for definition of a system risk-reliability modeling space. The enhanced SHA (E-SHA) technique yields a mishap risk index, which is projected based on a composite assessment of human-automated system reliability at the time of operation. The E-SHA was compared with one of the most advanced HRA techniques. Conclusion: The E-SHA technique supports broader safety control recommendations and provides comparable, if not more detailed, results than prior systems safety and HRA techniques.","[Kaber, David] North Carolina State Univ, Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC USA; [Zahabi, Maryam] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC USA",,"Kaber, D (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, ISE Dept, 400 Daniels Hall, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",dbkaber@ncsu.edu,,"Kaber, David/0000-0003-3413-1503",U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USANational Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) [2 T42 OH008673-08]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USANational Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) [T42OH008673] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,The authors would like to thank Dr. Eduardo Salas and the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and recommendations on the original manuscript submission.

Both anxiety and fear can be studied in the laboratory by measuring the potentiation of the startle reflex. The startle reflex is a defensive reflex that is potentiated when an organism is threatened and the need for defense is high. The startle reflex is assessed via electromyography (EMG) in the orbicularis oculi muscle elicited by brief, intense, bursts of acoustic white noise (i.e., startle probes). Startle potentiation is calculated as the increase in startle response magnitude during presentation of sets of visual threat cues that signal delivery of mild electric shock relative to sets of matched cues that signal the absence of shock (no-threat cues). In the Threat Probability Task, fear is measured via startle potentiation to high probability (100% cue-contingent shock; certain) threat cues whereas anxiety is measured via startle potentiation to low probability (20% cue-contingent shock; uncertain) threat cues. Measurement of startle potentiation during the Threat Probability Task provides an objective and easily implemented alternative to assessment of negative affect via self-report or other methods (e.g., neuroimaging) that may be inappropriate or impractical for some researchers. Startle potentiation has been studied rigorously in both animals (e.g., rodents, non-human primates) and humans which facilitates animal-to-human translational research. Startle potentiation during certain and uncertain threat provides an objective measure of negative affective and distinct emotional states (fear, anxiety) to use in research on psychopathology, substance use/abuse and broadly in affective science. As such, it has been used extensively by clinical scientists interested in psychopathology etiology and by affective scientists interested in individual differences in emotion.","[Bradford, Daniel E.; Magruder, Katherine P.; Korhumel, Rachel A.; Curtin, John J.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Bradford, DE (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jjcurtin@wisc.edu,,,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and AlcoholismUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA15384]; National Institute of Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [5R01DA033809-02]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA015384] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA033809] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This research was supported by Grants R01AA15384 from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and 5R01DA033809-02 from the National Institute of Drug Abuse to John J.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is thought to be a risk factor for development of PTSD. We tested the hypothesis that controlled cortical impact (CCI) would impair extinction of fear learned by Pavlovian conditioning, in mice. To mimic the scenarios in which TBI occurs prior to or after exposure to an aversive event, severe CCI was delivered to the left parietal cortex at one of two time points: (1) Prior to fear conditioning, or (2) after conditioning. Delay auditory conditioning was achieved by pairing a tone with a foot shock in context A. Extinction training involved the presentation of tones in a different context (context B) in the absence of foot shock. Test for extinction memory was achieved by presentation of additional tones alone in context B over the following two days. In pre- or post-injury paradigms, CCI did not influence fear learning and extinction. Furthermore, CCI did not affect locomotor activity or elevated plus maze testing. Our results demonstrate that, within the time frame studied, CCI does not impair the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear or extinction memory. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, despite being of clear theoretical and clinical significance, very few studies have examined fear extinction in adolescence, which is often described as a developmental window of vulnerability to psychological disorders. This paper reviews the relatively small body of research examining fear extinction in adolescence. A prominent finding of this work is that adolescents, both humans and rodents, exhibit a marked impairment in extinction relative to both younger (e.g., juvenile) and older (e.g., adult) groups. We then review some potential mechanisms that could produce the striking extinction deficit observed in adolescence. For example, one neurobiological candidate mechanism for impaired extinction in adolescence involves changes in the functional connectivity within the fear extinction circuit, particularly between prefrontal cortical regions and the amygdala. In addition, we review research on emotion regulation and attention processes that suggests that developmental changes in attention bias to threatening cues may be a cognitive mechanism that mediates age-related differences in extinction learning. We also examine how a differential reaction to chronic stress in adolescence impacts upon extinction retention during adolescence as well as in later life. Finally, we consider the findings of several studies illustrating promising approaches that overcome the typically-observed extinction impairments in adolescent rodents and that could be translated to human adolescents.

We infused an excitotoxic dose of glutamate in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) of adult rats in order to block the output projections to brainstem areas controlling the expression of conditioned fear responses. Subsequently, animals with excitotoxic lesions in the LA displayed altered short and long-term fear conditioned responses, but the integrity of their general emotional reactivity was preserved, as indicated by their open-field behavior. EPO infused immediately after glutamate succeeded to protect the conditioned fear performances of rats. This effect was reliably represented on both short, and long-term memory tests of conditioned fear. This and other studies have supported the potent neuroprotective activity of EPO, discriminable both morphologically, and behaviorally. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This process balances the inherent risks of an FiH study with maximal protection of subjects. Risk assessment should consider all available data, carefully identifying aspects that may lead to risk for healthy subjects. A structured risk assessment avoids omissions and promotes consistency. Such a risk assessment should be performed for Investigational Products as well as for challenge agents and study procedures.

Various lines of evidence indicate that this susceptibility variable is distributed rather broadly in the human population, with perhaps a factor of 25- to 50-fold between the center of this distribution and either of its tails, but cancer risk assessment at the EPA and elsewhere has always treated every (adult) human as identically susceptible. The National Academy of Sciences Silver Book concluded that EPA and the other agencies should fundamentally correct their mis-computation of carcinogenic risk in two ways: (1) adjust individual risk estimates upward to provide information about the upper tail; and (2) adjust population risk estimates upward (by about sevenfold) to correct an underestimation due to a mathematical property of the interindividual distribution of human susceptibility, in which the susceptibility averaged over the entire (right-skewed) population exceeds the median value for the typical human. In this issue of Risk Analysis, Kenneth Bogen disputes the second adjustment and endorses the first, though he also relegates the problem of underestimated individual risks to the realm of equity concerns that he says should have little if any bearing on risk management policy. In this article, I show why the basis for the population risk adjustment that the NAS recommended is correct-that current population cancer risk estimates, whether they are derived from animal bioassays or from human epidemiologic studies, likely provide estimates of the median with respect to human variation, which in turn must be an underestimate of the mean. If cancer risk estimates have larger  conservative biases embedded in them, a premise I have disputed in many previous writings, such a defect would not excuse ignoring this additional bias in the direction of underestimation. I also demonstrate that sensible, legally appropriate, and ethical risk policy must not only inform the public when the tail of the individual risk distribution extends into the  high-risk range, but must alter benefit-cost balancing to account for the need to try to reduce these tail risks preferentially.","Univ Penn, Sch Law, Penn Program Regulat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Finkel, AM (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Sch Law, Penn Program Regulat, 3501 Sansom St,Rm T-336, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",afinkel@law.upenn.edu,,"Finkel, Adam M./0000-0001-6259-9387",,,,27,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,OCT,2014,34,10,,,,,1785,1794,,10.1111/risa.12288,,,10,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",AU0NR,WOS:000345320600004,25335498,,,,2022-04-16,

Dysregulation of these processes can manifest in humans as a range of fear-related anxiety disorders like post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). In the present study, immunohistochemistry for acetyl H3, H4, c-fos, CBP (CREB-binding protein) in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) and prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) of mPFC (medial prefrontal cortex) and basal amygdala (BA), lateral amygdala (LA), centrolateral amygdala (CeL), centromedial amygdala (CeM) of the amygdala was performed to link region-specific histone acetylation to fear and extinction learning. It was found that the PL-PFC and IL-PFC along with the sub-regions of the amygdala responded differentially to the fear learning and extinction. Following fear learning, c-fos and CBP expression and acetylation of H3 and H4 increased in the BA, LA, CeM, and CeL and the PL-PFC but not in the IL-PFC as compared to the naive control. Similarly, following extinction learning, c-fos and CBP expression increased in BA, LA, CeL, and IL-PFC but not in PL-PFC and CeM as compared to the naive control and conditioned group. However, the acetylation of H3 increased in both IL and PL as opposed to H4 which increased only in the IL-PFC following extinction learning. Overall, region-specific activation in amygdala and PFC following fear and extinction learning as evident by the c-fos activation paralleled the H3/H4 acetylation in these regions. These results suggest that the differential histone acetylation in the PFC and amygdala subnuclei following fear learning and extinction may be associated with the region-specific changes in the neuronal activation pattern resulting in more fear/less fear.","[Siddiqui, Sarfraj Ahmad; Singh, Sanjay; Ranjan, Vandana; Prakash, Anand] BabasahebBhimrao Ambedkar Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Ugale, Rajesh] RTM Nagpur Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Saha, Sudipta] BabasahebBhimrao Ambedkar Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Prakash, A (corresponding author), BabasahebBhimrao Ambedkar Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",anandlohia@gmail.com,"Ugale, Rajesh/A-7858-2015","Ugale, Rajesh/0000-0002-0185-8186; Saha, Sudipta/0000-0002-0087-8652","Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, IndiaDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) India [BT/PR14365/MED/30/522/2012]","The authors thank the Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India, for funding this research (BT/PR14365/MED/30/522/2012).",,84,10,13,2,18,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0272-4340,1573-6830,,CELL MOL NEUROBIOL,Cell.

Renewal of the fear response may occur when re-encountering the conditioned stimulus within a novel context. Findings in rodents underpin the hippocampus' role in conditioned fear renewal in novel contexts, but it has yet to be investigated in humans. Forty-six healthy men took part in a 2-day, context-dependent, cued fear conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition, extinction learning (day 1) and extinction recall in the acquisition, extinction and a novel context one day later. Conditioned evaluative, skin conductance responses (SCRs) and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses served as dependent variables. Context-dependent fear renewal was reflected in stronger conditioned SCRs. In the acquisition context, individuals with a higher renewal of conditioned SCRs showed stronger activation of the fear circuit. Hippocampal activation distinguished conditioned responding in the novel compared with the extinction context. Individuals with a stronger renewal of conditioned SCRs in the novel context showed increased effective connectivity of hippocampal activation foci with structures in the fear and extinction network. These results outline the pivotal role of the hippocampus and its connectivity in conditioned fear renewal in a novel context in humans and might have important implications for exposure therapy in anxiety disorders.","[Hermann, A.; Stark, R.] Univ Giessen, Dept Psychotherapy & Syst Neurosci, Otto Behaghel Str 10H, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Hermann, A.; Stark, R.] Univ Giessen, Bender Inst Neuroimaging, Otto Behaghel Str 10H, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Milad, M.

Consequently, large carnivores avoid humans, but may use human-dominated landscapes by being nocturnal and elusive. Behavioral studies indicate that certain ecological systems are landscapes of fear, driven by antipredator behavior. Because behavior and physiology are closely interrelated, physiological assessments may provide insight into the behavioral response of large carnivores to human activity. To elucidate changes in brown bears' (Ursus arctos) behavior associated with human activity, we evaluated stress as changes in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in 12 GPS-collared, free-ranging bears, 7 males and 5 females, 3-11 years old, using cardiac-monitoring devices. We applied generalized linear regression models with HR and HRV as response variables and chest activity, time of day, season, distance traveled, and distance to human settlements from GPS positions recorded every 30 mm as potential explanatory variables. Bears exhibited lower HRV, an indication of stress, when they were close to human settlements and especially during the berry season, when humans were more often in the forest, picking berries and hunting. Our findings provide evidence of a human-induced landscape of fear in this hunted population of brown bears. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Conditioned fear was measured in rats as increased acoustic startle amplitude in the presence versus absence of a light or an odor paired previously with foot shock (fear-potentiated startle). Post-training lesions of both the lateral geniculate body (LG) and lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of the thalamus together, but not lesions of LG or LP alone, completely blocked the expression of fear-potentiated startle to a visual conditioned stimulus (CS) but not to an olfactory CS. These lesions also did not block contextual fear conditioning using startle or freezing as measures. Local infusion of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f] quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium, an AMPA antagonist, into the visual thalamus immediately before testing also blocked fear-potentiated startle to a visual CS, suggesting that the lesion effects were not attributable to damage of fibers of passage. Iontophoretic injections into the LP of the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine resulted in heavy anterograde labeling in two amygdala-fugal cortical areas: area TE2 and dorsal perirhinal cortex (PR), and moderate labeling in the lateral amygdaloid nucleus (L). These results suggest that, during classical fear conditioning, a visual stimulus can be transmitted to the amygdala via either lemniscal (i.e., LG -->V1, V2 --> TE2/PR) or non-lemniscal (i.e., LP --> V2, TE2/PR) thalamocortico-amygdala pathways, or direct thalamo-amygdala (i.e., LP --> L) projections.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Shi, CJ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1636 Pierce Dr,Suite 4000, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH-58922, MH 59906, MH-47840, MH-52384, MH-57250] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH047840, P50MH052384, R01MH057250, R01MH047840, R01MH059906, P50MH058922] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,54,112,118,0,9,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

A critical question is how personality dimensions such as trait anxiety act through these mechanisms to confer vulnerability to anxiety disorders, and whether humans' ability to overcome acquired fears depends on regulatory skills not characterized in animal models. In a neuroimaging study of fear conditioning in humans, we found evidence for two independent dimensions of neurocognitive function associated with trait vulnerability to anxiety. The first entailed increased amygdala responsivity to phasic fear cues. The second involved impoverished ventral prefrontal cortical (vPFC) recruitment to downregulate both cued and contextual fear prior to omission (extinction) of the aversive unconditioned stimulus. These two dimensions may contribute to symptomatology differences across anxiety disorders; the amygdala mechanism affecting the development of phobic fear and the frontal mechanism influencing the maintenance of both specific fears and generalized anxiety.","[Indovina, Iole; Robbins, Trevor W.; Bishop, Sonia J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Indovina, Iole] Santa Lucia Fdn, Lab Neuromotor Physiol, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [Nunez-Elizalde, Anwar O.; Bishop, Sonia J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dunn, Barnaby D.; Bishop, Sonia J.] MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England",,"Bishop, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Expt Psychol, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.",sbishop@berkeley.edu,"Robbins, Trevor W/A-7551-2008; Indovina, Iole/Z-2978-2019; Bishop, Sonia J/I-7729-2012","Indovina, Iole/0000-0002-1183-0013; Nunez-Elizalde, Anwar/0000-0003-1346-670X; Robbins, Trevor/0000-0003-0642-5977","Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G120/919, U1055.02.002.00001.01]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [RO1MH091848]; Marie Curie Intra European FellowshipEuropean Commission; James S McDonnell Foundation; University of Cambridge Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission; GlaxoSmithKlineGlaxoSmithKline; LundbeckLundbeck Corporation; LillyEli Lilly; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [G120/919, G1000183] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G0001354B, G0001354, G1000183] Funding Source: researchfish; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH091848] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Thanks go to M.

This implies that cognitive functions and organisational factors affect risk anal;sis much more than behavioural and physical performances. Another crucial issue of human reliability assessment concerns the dynamic nature of human-machine interaction. This feature covers a wide spectrum of real situations, but demands quite complex and extensive data. These considerations favour the development of new and evolutionary techniques which must be confronted with the requirements and needs of different types of risk analysis be carried out for different objectives, such as quantitative risk analysis, safety management, accident investigation, risk-based decision making and risk-based regulations. Advantages and areas of application of different techniques are briefly discussed, without attempting to develop a detailed comparison. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Forty-three adults (19 females and 24 males) were presented with sounds from the categories fear, disgust, and neutral. The stimuli were able to elicit the target emotions with sufficient specificity. The listening to fear-relevant sounds (e.g., screams of fear and pain) led to increased activation of the right superior temporal gyrus and the bilateral supramarginal gyrus. The hemodynamic responses to disgusting sounds (e.g., sniffing, diarrhea) were smaller. Our findings point to a differential neuronal sensitivity of the human brain to two basic emotion elicitors in the auditory domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Present treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy and pharmacological treatments show only moderate success, which emphasizes the importance for the development of new treatment protocols. Non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been probed as therapeutic option for anxiety disorders in recent years. Mechanistic information about their mode of action, and most efficient protocols is however limited. Here the fear extinction model can serve as a model of exposure therapies for studying therapeutic mechanisms, and development of appropriate intervention protocols. We systematically reviewed 30 research articles that investigated the impact of rTMS and tDCS on fear memory and extinction in animal models and humans, in clinical and healthy populations. The results of these studies suggest that tDCS and rTMS can be efficient methods to modulate fear memory and extinction. Furthermore, excitability-enhancing stimulation applied over the vmPFC showed the strongest potential to enhance fear extinction. We further discuss factors that determine the efficacy of rTMS and tDCS in the context of the fear extinction model and provide future directions to optimize parameters and protocols of stimulation for research and treatment.","[Markovic, Vuk; Yavari, Fatemeh; Salehinejad, Mohammad A.] Leibniz Res Ctr Working Environm & Human Factors, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Dortmund, Germany; [Markovic, Vuk; Nitsche, Michael A.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Int Grad Sch Neurosci, Bochum, Germany; [Vicario, Carmelo M.] Univ Messina, Dept Cognit Sci, Messina, Italy; [Nitsche, Michael A.] Univ Med Hosp Bergmannsheil, Dept Neurol, Bochum, Germany",,"Vicario, CM (corresponding author), Univ Messina, Dept Cognit Sci, Messina, Italy.",cvicario@unime.it,"VICARIO, CARMELO/AAR-2521-2021; Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali/K-6273-2019; Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali/J-8662-2018","Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali/0000-0003-1913-4677; Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali/0000-0003-1913-4677","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); BIAL foundationBial Foundation [160/18]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [316803389 - SFB 1280]","This work was supported by Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD), BIAL foundation (Prot.

Methods. Participants in a panel study of RA who were over age 50 (n = 570) Miere questioned about whether they experienced fear of falling and whether and how they limited activities due to fear of falling. Results, Fifty percent reported fear of falling, and 38% modified activities due to fear of falling. Correlates of fear of falling included female gender, depressive symptoms, poor physical functioning, minor fall-related injuries, and a greater number of painful joints. Correlates of limiting activities due to fear of falling included worse self-rated health, poor physical functioning, and high painful joint count. Activities commonly affected included stair climbing, walking, and outings. Conclusions, Fear of falling and limiting activities are common problems for persons with RA.

Auditory fear conditioning increases the tone responses of lateral amygdala neurons, but the increase is transient, lasting only a few hundred milliseconds after tone onset. It was recently reported that that the prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex transforms transient lateral amygdala input into a sustained PL output, which could drive fear responses via projections to the lateral division of basal amygdala (BL). To explore the possible mechanisms involved in this transformation, we developed a large-scale biophysical model of the BL-PL network, consisting of 850 conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-type cells, calcium-based learning, and neuromodulator effects. The model predicts that sustained firing in PL can be derived from BL-induced release of dopamine and norepinephrine that is maintained by PL-BL interconnections. These predictions were confirmed with physiological recordings from PL neurons during fear conditioning with the selective beta-blocker propranolol and by inactivation of BL with muscimol. Our model suggests that PL has a higher bandwidth than BL, due to PL's decreased internal inhibition and lower spiking thresholds. It also suggests that variations in specific microcircuits in the PL-BL interconnection can have a significant impact on the expression of fear, possibly explaining individual variability in fear responses. The human homolog of PL could thus be an effective target for anxiety disorders.","[Pendyam, Sandeep; Nair, Satish S.] Univ Missouri, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Bravo-Rivera, Christian; Burgos-Robles, Anthony; Sotres-Bayon, Francisco; Quirk, Gregory J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Anat, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Bravo-Rivera, Christian; Burgos-Robles, Anthony; Sotres-Bayon, Francisco; Quirk, Gregory J.] Univ Puerto Rico, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",,"Nair, SS (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, 229 EBW, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",,"Sotres-Bayon, Francisco/AAE-1652-2021; Rivera, Christian Bravo/J-5741-2015","Rivera, Christian Bravo/0000-0002-6716-4443; Sotres-Bayon, Francisco/0000-0003-3829-7463; Nair, Satish S./0000-0002-1489-7029","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01-MH087755, R01-MH058883, R01-MH081975]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH081975, R01MH087755, R01MH058883] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was supported in part by National Institute of Mental Health Grants R01-MH087755 to S.

The treated freshwater is blended with desalinated water to increase the water supply. The desalinated and blended water contains disinfection byproducts (DBPs), some of which may induce cancer risk to human. In this study, concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs) in desalinated and blended water in Saudi Arabia were investigated, and human exposure and risk were predicted. The intakes of THMs (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) were predicted to be 8.38 x 10(-5), 7.57 x 10(-5), 2.54 x 10(-5), and 4.32 x 10(-4) mg/kg-d, respectively. The overall cancer risk and hazard index were estimated to be 1.78 x 10(-5) (range: 7.40 x 10(-7)-9.26 x 10(-5)) and 3.49 x 10(-2) (range: 1.20 x 10(-3)-2.34 x 10(-1)), respectively.

The loss of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) was predicted to be 25.1 per year while the cancer risk represented 8.48 x 10(-7) DALY per person per year. The financial burden from such risk was estimated to be US$ 2.72 (range: US$ 2.52-2.91) million per year.

Yet studies of human decision-making typically involve money, whereas nonhuman studies involve food. We therefore examined how context shifts human risk preferences to illuminate the evolution of decision-making. First, we assessed peoples' risk preferences across food, prizes, and money in a task where individuals received real rewards and learned about payoffs through experience. We found that people were relatively more risk-seeking for both food and prizes compared to money-indicating that people may treat abstract reward markers differently from concrete rewards. Second, we compared human risk preferences for food with that of our closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), in order to illuminate the evolutionary origins of human decision-making strategies. In fact, human and chimpanzees were both relatively more risk-seeking compared to bonobos. Finally, we investigated why people respond differently to money versus concrete rewards when making decisions. We found that people were more risk-prone when making decisions about money that was constrained as a store of value, compared to money that could be freely exchanged. This shows that people are sensitive to money's usefulness as a store of value that can be used to acquire other types of rewards. Our results indicate that humans exhibit different preferences when making risky decisions about money versus food, an important consideration for comparative research. Furthermore, different psychological processes may underpin decisions about abstract rewards compared to concrete rewards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-one male and thirty-five female adolescents aged ten to thirteen participated in a prospective study with up to five assessments. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant effect of sex, with girls showing stronger fear-potentiation at all pubertal stages. Post hoc tests revealed that fear-potentiation increased in girls but not boys over the course of puberty. Furthermore, baseline startle decreased over the course of puberty. Because age was included as a covariate in all analyses, the puberty effect cannot be accounted for by age. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for a significant increase in fear-potentiated startle across the pubertal transition.

Measures of fear were fear of pain (FOP), measured by the Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ-III); fear-potentiated startle; and a self-report measure that assessed the effectiveness of the fear induction procedure. In the pain intensity data, there was a trend towards a placebo effect. This trend was abolished by induced fear, and was most pronounced in subjects who were highest in measures of fear. The placebo manipulation also caused a reduction in startle reflex amplitude. This effect was abolished by induced fear, and was strongest amongst high FOP subjects. In conclusion, induced fear abolished placebo analgesia, and this effect was strongest in subjects who had high scores on measures of fear. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

For instance, humans can learn to be fearful of subliminal fear relevant images - images depicting stimuli thought to have been fear relevant in our evolutionary context, such as snakes, spiders, and angry human faces. Such stimuli could have a privileged status in relation to manipulations used to suppress usually salient images from awareness, possibly due to the existence of a designated sub-cortical 'fear module'. Here we assess this proposition, and find it wanting. We use binocular masking to suppress awareness of images of snakes and wallabies (particularly cute, non-threatening marsupials). We find that subliminal presentations of both classes of image can induce differential fear conditioning. These data show that learning, as indexed by fear conditioning, is neither contingent on conscious visual awareness nor on subliminal conditional stimuli being fear relevant.","[Lipp, Ottmar V.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Lipp, Ottmar V.] Univ Queensland, Sci Learning Res Ctr, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Kempnich, Clare; Jee, Sang Hoon; Arnold, Derek H.] Univ Queensland, Dept Psychol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",,"Lipp, OV (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",ottmar.lipp@curtin.edu.au,"Lipp, Ottmar V./A-1254-2007","Lipp, Ottmar V./0000-0001-6734-8608; Arnold, Derek/0000-0003-1027-6222",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP110100460],"This research was funded by the Australian Research Council (DP110100460).

This study contributes to the literature by filling the knowledge gap on the fear of vaccination by focusing on Nigerian caregivers. Methods: The study evaluates the correlation between fear of vaccination and knowledge, actual behaviors, and perception among caregivers in 11 settlements in the Jada local government area of Adamawa State, northeastern Nigeria. The data were collected in September 2019. We use logistic regression analysis to evaluate the correlation. Results and Discussions: About 15% of caregivers have some form of fear regarding vaccination. However, such fear is not correlated with most of the socio-demographic characteristics among caregivers. Fear is significantly correlated with the lack of accurate vaccination knowledge, with a lower likelihood of vaccination uptake for their children, and with the lack of perceptions of vaccination importance and intention to vaccinate their children. Results from our study are consistent with findings from existing studies conducted in developed countries.","[Sato, Ryoko] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Global Hlth & Populat, 90 Smith St,332-1, Boston, MA 02120 USA",,"Sato, R (corresponding author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Global Hlth & Populat, 90 Smith St,332-1, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",rsato@hsph.harvard.edu,,,,,,16,3,3,2,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2164-5515,2164-554X,,HUM VACC IMMUNOTHER,Human Vaccines Immunother.,OCT 2,2020,16,10,,,,,2438,2448,,10.1080/21645515.2020.1723365,,FEB 2020,11,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,OM4DC,WOS:000515051200001,32083514,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2022-04-16,

The field has focused on examining the role of various regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala in conditioned fear and its extinction. The contribution of this 'fear network' to the conscious awareness of fear has recently been questioned. And as such, there is a need to examine higher/multiple cortical systems that might contribute to the conscious feeling of fear and anxiety. Herein, we studied functional connectivity patterns across the entire brain to examine the contribution of multiple networks to the acquisition of fear extinction learning and its retrieval. We conducted trial-by-trial analyses on data from 137 healthy participants who underwent a two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. We found that functional connectivity across a broad range of brain regions, many of which are part of the default mode, frontoparietal, and ventral attention networks, increased from early to late extinction learning only to a conditioned cue. The increased connectivity during extinction learning predicted the magnitude of extinction memory tested 24 h later. Together, these findings provide evidence supporting recent studies implicating distributed brain regions in learning, consolidation and expression of fear extinction memory in the human brain.","[Wen, Zhenfu; Chen, Zhe Sage; Milad, Mohammed R.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Chen, Zhe Sage] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci & Physiol, New York, NY USA; [Chen, Zhe Sage; Milad, Mohammed R.] NYU, Sch Med, Neurosci Inst, New York, NY USA; [Milad, Mohammed R.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY USA",,"Milad, MR (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10012 USA.",mohammed.milad@nyulangone.org,,,"US National Science Founda-tion (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1835000]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-NS100065, R01-MH118928, R01-MH097880, R01-MH097964]","This work was supported by the US National Science Founda-tion (NSF) grant CBET-1835000 (Z.S.C.) , the National Institutes of Health grants R01-NS100065 (Z.S.C.) , R01-MH118928 (Z.S.C.) , R01-MH097880 (M.R.M.) and R01-MH097964 (M.R.M.) .

Although learned fear can be extinguished, extinction memories are fragile. The resilience of fear memories to extinction may contribute to the maintenance of disorders of fear and anxiety, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As such, considerable effort has been placed on understanding the neural circuitry underlying the acquisition, expression, and extinction of emotional memories in rodent models as well as in humans. A triad of brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, form an essential brain circuit involved in fear conditioning and extinction. Within this circuit, the prefrontal cortex is thought to exert top-down control over subcortical structures to regulate appropriate behavioral responses. Importantly, a division of labor has been proposed in which the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subdivisions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulate the expression and suppression of fear in rodents, respectively. Here, we critically review the anatomical and physiological evidence that has led to this proposed dichotomy of function within mPFC. We propose that under some conditions, the PL and IL act in concert, exhibiting similar patterns of neural activity in response to aversive conditioned stimuli and during the expression or inhibition of conditioned fear. This may stem from common synaptic inputs, parallel downstream outputs, or corticocortical interactions. Despite this functional covariation, these mPFC subdivisions may still be coding for largely opposing behavioral outcomes, with PL biased towards fear expression and IL towards suppression.","[Maren, Stephen] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Psychol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Inst Neurosci, College Stn, TX USA",,"Maren, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Psychol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",maren@tamu.edu,"Maren, Stephen/B-6182-2014","Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411; Giustino, Thomas/0000-0002-5361-8045",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 MH065961]; McKnight Memory and Cognitive Disorders Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH065961] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (R01 MH065961) and a McKnight Memory and Cognitive Disorders Award to SM.,,262,266,267,1,122,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Allopregnanolone (ALLO), for example, is a metabolite of progesterone that has been linked to anxiety-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder. In rodents, it has been shown to reduce anxiety in a number of behavioral paradigms including Pavlovian fear conditioning. We have recently found that expression of conditioned contextual (but not auditory) freezing in rats can be suppressed by infusion of ALLO into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). To further explore the nature of this effect, we infused ALLO into the BNST of male rats prior to both conditioning and testing. We found that suppression of contextual fear occurred when the hormone was present during either conditioning or testing but not during both procedures, suggesting that ALLO acts in a state-dependent manner within the BNST. A shift in interoceptive context during testing for animals conditioned under ALLO provided further support for this mechanism of hormonal action on contextual fear. Interestingly, infusions of ALLO into the basolateral amygdala produced a state-independent suppression of both conditioned contextual and auditory freezing. Altogether, these results suggest that ALLO can influence the acquisition and expression of fear memories by both state-dependent and state-independent mechanisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Both aposematically and cryptically coloured snakes presented as both colour and black-and-white pictures received higher perceived fear scores than other vertebrates. This suggests that aposematic colouration does not play a crucial role in eliciting fear of snakes.

Dating back to at least the seventeenth-century Enlightenment, the ability for parents to shape child behavior in an enduring way has been noted. Twentieth-century scholars developed theories to explain how parenting histories influence psychological development, and since that time, the number of scientific publications on parenting influences in both human and nonhuman animal fields has grown at an exponential rate, reaching numbers in the thousands by 2015. This special issue describes a symposium delivered by Megan Gunnar, Regina Sullivan, Mar Sanchez, and Nim Tottenham in the Fall of 2014 at the Society for Social Neuroscience. The goal of the symposium was to describe the emerging knowledge on neurobiological mechanisms that mediate parent-offspring interactions across three different species: rodent, monkey, and human. The talks were aimed at designing testable models of parenting effects on the development of emotional and stress regulation. Specifically, the symposium aimed at characterizing the special modulatory (buffering) effects of parental cues on fear- and stress-relevant neurobiology and behaviors of the offspring and to discuss examples of impaired buffering when the parent-infant relationship is disrupted.","[Gunnar, Megan R.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Child Dev, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hostinar, Camelia E.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL USA; [Sanchez, Mar M.] Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Sanchez, Mar M.] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Tottenham, Nim] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sullivan, Regina M.] Nathan S Kline Inst Psychiat Res, Emot Brain Inst, Orangeburg, SC USA; [Sullivan, Regina M.] NYU, Langone Sch Med, Ctr Child Study, Child & Adolescent Psychiat, New York, NY USA",,"Tottenham, N (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA.",nlt7@columbia.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-1439258]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH078105]; NICHDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [HD083217]; Dana Foundation; Office of Research Infrastructure Programs/OD (ORIP/OD) [P51OD11132];  [F32HD078048];  [NIH-DC009910];  [MH091451];  [R01DA038588];  [R01HD077623];  [R21HD055255];  [R01MH091864]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R37HD083217, R01HD077623, F32HD078048] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH &HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R21HD055255, R01HD033402] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P51RR000165] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH091451, P50MH078105, R01MH091864] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01DC009910] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA038588] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P51OD011132] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Effort on this manuscript was supported by NSF conference grant BCS-1439258 (to M.R.

These symptoms reflect dysregulation of the fear system likely caused by poor fear inhibition/extinction, increased generalization, and/or enhanced consolidation or acquisition of fear. These phenotypes can be modeled in animal subjects using Pavlovian fear conditioning, allowing investigation of the underlying neurobiology of normative and pathological fear. Preclinical studies reveal a number of neurotransmitter systems and circuits critical for aversive learning and memory that have informed the development of therapies used in human clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a number of established and emerging pharmacotherapies and device-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder that have been developed via a bench to bedside translational model.","[Bowers, Mallory E.; Ressler, Kerry J.] Emory Univ, Behav Neurosci, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.] Emory Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA",,"Ressler, KJ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, 954 Gatewood Dr NE, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",kressle@emory.edu,,"Bowers, Mallory/0000-0003-1618-1881","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32-GM08605, 1F31MH097397, R01MH096764]; Burroughs Wellcome FundBurroughs Wellcome Fund; National Institutes of Health/National Center for Research Resources base grant [P51RR000165]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P51RR000165] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM008605] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH094757, F31MH097397, R01MH096764, R01MH071537] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [T32NS096050] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Support was provided by National Institutes of Health (T32-GM08605, 1F31MH097397, and R01MH096764), the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and by an National Institutes of Health/National Center for Research Resources base grant (P51RR000165) to Yerkes National Primate Research Center.",,233,89,90,1,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Predator threats change across an animal's lifetime, as do abilities that enable the animal to learn or engage in different defensive behaviors. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the combination of factors that successfully induce unlearned fear to predator odor across development. Infant, juvenile, adolescent, and adult rats were exposed to one of the three odor stimuli (control odor, cat urine, or cat fur) in either a small or large chamber. Though all ages displayed fear-related behavior to cat odors, differences were reflected only in freezing behavior and not, as expected, risk-assessment. Infant and juvenile animals also increased freezing to cat urine compared to the control odor, possibly because these age groups possess limited defensive options to cope with threat and so may respond with freezing to all predator stimuli. Unexpectedly, chamber size had no effect on either freezing or risk-assessment in this study. Once the parameters of unconditioned fear are understood, they can be exploited to develop a learning paradigm to predator odors that could be used in early life. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These responses are enhanced when subjects anticipate an aversive event compared to periods when subjects are resting ('fear potentiation'). It has been reported previously that the anxiolytic diazepam can suppress fear-potentiation of the eyeblink startle response in human volunteers. The present experiment aimed to confirm and extend these observations by examining the effect of another benzodiazepine, lorazepam, on the eyeblink and skinconductance components of the acoustic startle, and on fear-potentiation of these responses. Eighteen male volunteers participated in threeweekly sessions in which they received oral treatment with placebo, lorazepam (1 mg) and lorazepam (2 mg), according to a balanced three-period, crossover, double-blind design. Two hours after ingestion of the treatments, electromyographic responses of the orbicularis oculi muscle and skin conductance responses were evoked by sound pulses during alternating periods in which the threat of an electric shock (electrodes attached to the subject's wrist) was present (THREAT) and absent (SAFE). The THREAT condition was associated with significant increase in the amplitude of the electromyographic (EMG) and skin conductance responses; there were also increases in baseline skin conductance, the number and amplitude of 'spontaneous' skin conductance fluctuations and self-rated anxiety. Lorazepam attenuated the effect of THREAT on self-rated anxiety and on the amplitude of the EMG response, but had no significant effect on fear-potentiation of the skin conductanceresponses. These results extend previous findings of the effect of diazepam on the fear-potentiated eyeblink startle response to lorazepam, and suggest that fear-potentiation of the later autonomic component of the startle response may be less sensitive to benzodiazepines than the fear-potentiated eyeblink response and self-rated anxiety.","Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Med, Div Psychiat,Psychopharmacol Sect, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; Merck Res Labs, Blue Bell, PA USA; Merck Res Labs, Rahway, NJ USA; Merck Res Labs, Harlow, Essex, England",,"Bradshaw, CM (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Med, Div Psychiat,Psychopharmacol Sect, Floor B, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England.",C.M.Bradshaw@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,46,29,29,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0269-8811,1461-7285,,J PSYCHOPHARMACOL,J.

Therefore, managing human factors is an important way to prevent accidents. This paper aims to introduce a new method to assess and manage human factors. First, the accident causation model was improved based on Reason's Swiss-cheese model, which was then combined with the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to establish the human factors risk assessment model. The evaluation model includes 5 levels (organization influence, unsafe supervision, preconditions for unsafe acts, unsafe acts, and emergency influence) and 25 human factors. In the risk assessment process, the set pair analysis method was used to calculate the connection number and the partial connection number of each factor, level and whole system. The safety score and risk development interval were calculated by using the connection number, and the risk grade is determined. Thus, the dynamic quantitative evaluation of human risk is realized. By using the partial connection number, the risk development trend of each factor is predicted. Due to the lack of human managed enterprises, the safety status of people is approximately discrete. Therefore, this paper establishes the SPA-Markov chain risk prediction model to predict human risk. The verification results show that the prediction error is less than 2%. This indicates that the prediction model can be applied in practice. To reduce human risk, ABC analysis and the S-O-R model were used for human risk management. The application results show that this method has a significant effect on improving human safety factors. Finally, this paper summarizes 12 common unsafe factors and their effective safety stimulus measure, researching the accident path. According to the organizational level and individual level of human factors, different kinds of human factors management methods are suggested. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Conditioning of PetCO(2) (decrease), respiratory cycle time (decrease) and inspiratory duty time (increase) was established and subsequently extinguished. When participants were clustered according to their conditioned PetCO(2) responses during acquisition, only a group showing a conditioned decrease in PetCO(2) showed also a differential cardiac acceleration, a decrease in expiratory duration and an increase in inspiratory duty time in response to the CS+.

However, 40% of patients do not respond to this treatment. Efforts have focused on individual differences in treatment response, but have not examined when, during development, such treatments may be most effective. We examined fear-extinction learning across development in mice and humans. Parallel behavioral studies revealed attenuated extinction learning during adolescence. Probing neural circuitry in mice revealed altered synaptic plasticity of prefrontal cortical regions implicated in suppression of fear responses across development. The results suggest a lack of synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal regions, during adolescence, is associated with blunted regulation of fear extinction. These findings provide insight into optimizing treatment outcomes for when, during development, exposure therapies may be most effective.","[Pattwell, Siobhan S.; Jing, Deqiang; Elliott, Mark D.; Yang, Rui R.; Soliman, Fatima; Glatt, Charles E.; Casey, B.

In particular, we investigated the interaction between experiences of wolf attacks (both on people and livestock) and three factors: behavioral action (management action, e.g., livestock carcass management), religious (e.g., the belief that wolves can be a curse if harmed by humans), and cultural norms (e.g., village elders have taught their children not to kill or harm wolves). We surveyed 400 randomly chosen households throughout the villages located in Hamadan province, Iran. Participants (mean age = 48.5 years) reported experiences of wolf attacks on people and on livestock in 40% and 60% of interviews, respectively. The majority of the respondents were afraid of seeing a wolf in the wild (66.5%). The majority of interviewees abandoned their livestock carcasses near agricultural lands, rangelands, and rural areas. Our results suggest that cultural factors play an active role in allaying fear of wolves, and this influence occurs regardless of having or not having experiences of wolf attacks. However, experiences of wolf-livestock attacks did not have a meaningful role in decreasing or increasing the effect of culture, religion, and behavior on fear. Efforts to reduce human fear of wolves should consider minimizing risky encounters for people, particularly focusing on unsupervised children (<12 years old). Training programs on how to properly handle livestock carcasses (e.g., appropriate methods of disposal and not abandoning livestock carcasses close to human settlements) may reduce the frequency of wolf attacks.","[Mohammadi, Alireza] Univ Jiroft, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Jiroft, Iran; [Alambeigi, Amir] Univ Tehran, Coll Agr Econ & Dev, Dept Agr Extens & Educ, Karaj, Iran; [Lopez-Bao, Jose Vicente] Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers UO CSIC PA, Mieres, Spain; [Kaboli, Mohammad] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm Sci, Karaj, Iran",,"Kaboli, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm Sci, Karaj, Iran.",mkaboli@ut.ac.ir,"Mohammadi, Alireza/AAB-9913-2022; Alambeigi, Amir/ABG-6306-2021","Mohammadi, Alireza/0000-0003-3701-6455; Alambeigi, Amir/0000-0001-6576-2071","National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [GEFNE128-14]; National Geographic Society under the UK Wolf Conservation TrustNational Geographic Society; Ramon & Cajal research contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness [RYC-2015-18932]","We thank the National Geographic Society who funded this research under the grant GEFNE128-14 and the UK Wolf Conservation Trust.

In the happy odor condition, females, in contrast to males, displayed a significantly higher interest to the stranger compared to their owner. In the fear condition, dogs spent more time with their owner compared to the stranger. Behaviors directed towards the door, indicative of exit interest, had a longer duration in the fear condition than the other two conditions. Female dogs revealed a significantly longer door-directed behavior in the fear condition compared to the control condition.

The interactions between these two factors are unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of different levels of fear of birth and mode of delivery on birth experience 1month after birth. MethodsAs part of an ongoing prospective study, we interviewed 3,006 women in their third trimester and 1month after first childbirth to assess fear of birth and birth experience. Logistic regression was performed to examine the interactions and associations between fear of birth, mode of delivery and birth experience. ResultsCompared with women with low levels of fear of birth, women with intermediate levels of fear, and women with high levels of fear had a more negative birth experience and were more affected by an unplanned cesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery. Compared with women with low levels of fears with a noninstrumental vaginal delivery, women with high levels of fear who were delivered by unplanned cesarean section had a 12-fold increased risk of reporting a negative birth experience (OR 12.25; 95% CI 7.19-20.86). A noninstrumental vaginal delivery was associated with the most positive birth experience among the women in this study. ConclusionsThis study shows that both levels of prenatal fear of childbirth and mode of delivery are important for birth experience. Women with low fear of childbirth who had a noninstrumental vaginal delivery reported the most positive birth experience.

One of the most replicated findings in the field is the two-fold higher PTSD incidence in females compared to males. While sociocultural factors play a role, the most robust biological influencers to date are gonadal hormones, such as estradiol and progesterone, which fluctuate across the menstrual cycle. Among studies that account for these hormones, most do so in isolation or collect both and only report one. Variation in study findings suggests that the ratio between these two hormones (the P/E ratio) may be an important and missing variable to further understand gonadal hormone influences on fear. Here we review cross-species examinations of fear and PTSD, within the contexts of estradiol and progesterone as well as P/E ratios that were calculated based on extant literature. We then provide recommendations for best practices in assay methods and reporting to improve research on the P/E ratio in fear and PTSD.

Social fear recognition deficits following amygdala lesions are often interpreted as reflecting perceptual deficits, or the amygdala's role in coordinating responses to threats. But these explanations fail to capture why amygdala lesions impair both physiological and behavioural responses to multimodal fear cues and the ability to identify them. We hypothesized that social fear recognition deficits following amygdala damage reflect impaired conceptual understanding of fear. Supporting this prediction, we found specific impairments in the ability to predict others' fear (but not other emotions) from written scenarios following bilateral amygdala lesions. This finding is consistent with the suggestion that social fear recognition, much like social recognition of states like pain, relies on shared internal representations. Preserved judgements about the permissibility of causing others fear confirms suggestions that social emotion recognition and morality are dissociable.","[Cardinale, Elise M.; Marsh, Abigail A.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [O'Connell, Katherine] Georgetown Univ, Interdisciplinary Program Neurosci, Washington, DC USA; [Reber, Justin] Univ Iowa Hosp & Clin, Dept Psychiat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Turkeltaub, Peter E.] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Brain Plast & Recovery, Washington, DC USA; [Turkeltaub, Peter E.] MedStar Natl Rehabil Hosp, Div Res, Washington, DC USA; [Tranel, Daniel] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Iowa City, IA USA; [Buchanan, Tony W.] St Louis Univ, Dept Psychol, 221 N Grand Blvd, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",,"Cardinale, EM (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",emc62@georgetown.edu,,"Turkeltaub, Peter/0000-0003-2080-6055; Buchanan, Tony/0000-0002-9166-8457; Reber, Justin/0000-0002-4489-569X; O'Connell, Katherine/0000-0002-9649-9007; Cardinale, Elise/0000-0002-5117-6124; Marsh, Abigail/0000-0001-5635-181X","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 GM108540, 1 P50 MH094258-04A1, R01DC014960]",NIH T32 GM108540 (PI: D.T.). 1 P50 MH094258-04A1 (PI: D.T.).

Poor contextual memory of trauma may subsequently contribute to intrusive memories and overgeneralization of fear. Glucose consumption following trauma may be a means to protect hippocampal functioning and contextual fear learning. This study experimentally examined the effect of glucose on hippocampal-dependent contextual learning versus cued fear learning in humans. Methods: Forty-two male participants underwent cued conditioning with an unconditional stimulus (US) (shock) paired with a discrete conditional stimulus (geometric shape) and context conditioning (requiring hippocampal processing) with a US unpredictably paired with a background context (picture of room). Participants were then blindly randomized to consume either a 25 g glucose or sweet-tasting placebo drink and returned for a test phase 24 hours later. Measures included acoustic startle response, US expectancy, blood glucose levels, and arousal ratings. Results: The glucose group showed superior retention of hippocampal-dependent contextual learning at test relative to the placebo group, as demonstrated by acoustic startle response and US expectancy ratings. Glucose and placebo groups did not differ on any measure of cued fear learning at test. Conclusions: This study provides experimental evidence that in mildly stressed humans postconditioning glucose consumption improves retention of hippocampal-dependent contextual learning but not cued learning. Ultimately, glucose consumption following trauma may be a means of improving learning about the traumatic context, thereby preventing subsequent development of symptoms of posttraumatic stress.","[Glenn, Daniel E.; Minor, Thomas R.; Craske, Michelle G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Vervliet, Bram] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Glenn, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall,Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",dglenn82@ucla.edu,"Vervliet, Bram/AAE-6276-2019","Vervliet, Bram/0000-0002-5904-4257",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); Naval Health Research Center; Stress & Motivated Behavior Institute,Mr. Glenn reports having received research funding from the National Institute of Mental Health.

Once reactivated, these memories need reconsolidation to become permanent. Sleep is critical for memory consolidation. Is sleep necessary for memory reconsolidation? We hypothesized that sleep loss immediately after fear reactivation (FR) will prevent memory reconsolidation. To test our hypothesis, two experiments were performed in adult male C57BL/6J mice exposed to contextual fear conditioning paradigm with inescapable foot shock as unconditional stimulus (US) and contextual cage as conditional stimulus (CS). Sleep loss was achieved either by 5 h of sleep deprivation (SD; Experiment 1) or by systemic infusion of modafinil (200 mg/Kg, ip), an FDA approved wake-promoting agent (Experiment 2). One hour after light-onset, fear memory acquisition (FMA) was performed on Day 1. Mice were allowed to explore CS for 5 min followed by presentation of US (7 foot-shocks; 0.5 mA, 2.0 s duration) at pseudorandom intervals. Controls were exposed to similar CS but no shocks were delivered. On Day 2, mice were exposed to CS for 2 min (without US; for FR) followed by either sleep loss or no sleep loss. On Day 3, fear memory recall (FMR) was performed by exposing mice to CS (without US) for 12 min. Percent time spent in freezing was monitored during FC, FR and FMR. Our results suggested that as compared to sleeping controls, mice with sleep loss immediately after FR displayed a significant reduction in percent time freezing during FMR. These results suggest that sleep loss may prevent memory reconsolidation.

Though much of the pathogenic influence of such generalization may lie in the associated avoidance, few studies have assessed maladaptive avoidance decisions associated with Pavlovian generalization. Lab-based assessments of this process, here referred to as aversive Pavlovian-instrumental covariation during generalization (APIC-G), have recently begun. The current study represents a next step in this line of work by conducting the first examination of anxiety-related dimensions of personality that may exacerbate APIC-G. Specifically, we test anxiety sensitivity (AS) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as moderators of relations between Pavlovian generalization and maladaptive avoidance decisions in 102 undergraduate students with wide-ranging levels of IU and AS. Results indicate a facilitative effect of AS on this APIC-G process, with AS strengthening relations between Pavlovian generalization and maladaptive generalized avoidance whether operationalizing Pavlovian generalization with psychophysiological (fear-potentiated startle) or behavioral measures. Additionally, IU was found to facilitate APIC-G when indexing Pavlovian generalization with behavioral but not fear-potentiated startle measures. Moderating effects of AS were most pronounced for stimulus classes bearing the highest resemblance to CS+ , whereas effects of IU were most pronounced for the stimulus class with the highest level of threat ambiguity. Results implicate AS and IU as risk factors for the maladaptive decisional correlates of Pavlovian generalization and suggest that established associations between these traits and clinical anxiety may derive, in part, from their enhancement of maladaptive APIC-G. General Scientific Summary The generalization of fear from dangerous situations to resembling safe situations is a core feature of clinical anxiety, and much of the dysfunction from such generalization lies in its association with excessive avoidance. In the present study, we identify two personality-based risk factors for clinical anxiety (anxiety sensitivity [AS], intolerance of uncertainty [IU]) that facilitate the degree to which generalization of fear is associated with maladaptive avoidance decisions. Such findings implicate levels of IU and AS as cross-diagnostic indicators of the extent to which maladaptive generalized avoidance may be contributing to the symptom profile of a given anxiety patient.","[Hunt, Christopher; Cooper, Samuel E.; Hartnell, Melissa P.; Lissek, Shmuel] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Psychol, Clin Sci & Psychopathol Res Program, Minneapolis, MN USA",,"Lissek, S (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Psychol, 75 East River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",smlissek@umn.edu,"Cooper, Samuel/AAY-2417-2021","Cooper, Samuel/0000-0001-9563-1750",,,,47,23,24,5,28,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0021-843X,1939-1846,,J ABNORM PSYCHOL,J.

This can be studied in risk perception during movement in relation to specific habitat types, whereby individuals trade-off between foraging and disturbance. Due to its high behavioral plasticity and increasing occurrence in urban environments, wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an excellent model organism to study adjustment to urbanization. With the help of GPS tracking, space use of 11 wild boar from Berlin's metropolitan region was analyzed: we aimed at understanding how animals adjust space use to deal with the landscape of fear in urban areas compared to rural areas. We compared use vs. availability with help of generalized linear mixed models. First, we studied landscape types selected by rural vs. urban wild boar, second, we analyzed distances of wild boar locations to each of the landscape types. Finally, we mapped the resulting habitat selection probability to predict hotspots of human-wildlife conflicts. A higher tolerance to disturbance in urban wild boar was shown by a one third shorter flight distance and by an increased re-use of areas close to the trap. Urban wild boar had a strong preference for natural landscapes such as swamp areas, green areas and deciduous forests, and areas with high primary productivity, as indicated by high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) values. The areas selected by urban wild boar were often located closely to roads and houses. The spatial distribution maps show that a large area of Berlin would be suitable for urban wild boar but not their rural conspecifics, with the most likely reason being a different perception of anthropogenic disturbance. Wild boar therefore showed considerable behavioral plasticity suitable to adjust to human-dominated environments in a potentially evolutionarily adaptive manner.","[Stillfried, Milena; Gras, Pierre; Boerner, Konstantin; Wenzler, Moritz; Hofer, Heribert; Ortmann, Sylvia; Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Gras, Pierre] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, Berlin, Germany; [Goeritz, Frank; Painer, Johanna; Roellig, Kathleen] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Reprod Management, Berlin, Germany; [Wenzler, Moritz] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany",,"Stillfried, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany.",stillfried@izw-berlin.de,"Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/A-8778-2013; Hofer, Heribert/AAF-7854-2021; Ortmann, Sylvia/B-7088-2015; Gras, Pierre/E-4398-2016","Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/0000-0002-9269-4446; Hofer, Heribert/0000-0002-2813-7442; Ortmann, Sylvia/0000-0003-2520-6251; Gras, Pierre/0000-0002-4269-0770; Painer - Gigler, Johanna/0000-0003-3929-511X",Stiftung Naturschutz; Leibniz Institute for Zoo & Wildlife Research; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF within the Collaborative Project Bridging in Biodiversity Science-BIBS [01LC1501A-H]; Leibniz Association,"We thank Andreas Burchardt, Andreas Constien, Egbert Gleich, Erica Grant, Bodo Janitza, Uwe Peschke, Marion Schmolke, and Heiko Wessendorf for their help with trapping wild boar, the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) and Hinrich Zoller (University of Rostock) for providing traps, Anne Berger and Knut Eichhorn for the use of telemetry devices, Matthias Busch, and Ilja Heckmann for assistance with data analyses and National Geographic, the Stiftung Naturschutz and the Leibniz Institute for Zoo & Wildlife Research for funding.

Here, we compared three pathways by which avoidance of the US may be acquired both directly (i.e., through trial-and-error instrumental learning) and indirectly (i.e., via verbal instructions and social observation). Methods: Following fear conditioning in which CS+ was paired with shock and CS was unpaired, three separate groups of participants learned by direct experience (Instrumental-learning), were instructed about (Instructed-learning), or observed (Observational-learning) a demonstrator performing an avoidance response that canceled upcoming US (shock) presentations. Groups were then tested in extinction with presentations of the directly experienced CS+ and CS, and either a novel CS (Instrumental and observational groups) or an instructed CS (instructed-group). Results: Similar to instrumental learning, results demonstrate that avoidance may be acquired via instructions and social observation in the absence of directly learning that an avoidance response prevents the US. Retrospective US expectancy ratings were modulated by the assumed presence or absence of avoidance. Overall, these findings suggest that instrumental-, instructed-, and observational-learning pathways to avoidance in humans are similar. Limitations: Alternative experimental designs would permit direct comparison between the pathways for stimuli with no prior experience of fear conditioning, and trial-by-trial US expectancy ratings would help track the modulation of fear by avoidance pathway. Conclusions: Instrumental-, instructed-, and observational-learning pathways of avoidance are similar. Findings may have implications for understanding the etiology of clinical avoidance in anxiety.

Here we investigated the effect of maternal availability during fear conditioning in a group of children (ages 8-10) and adolescents (ages 11-13) from a low-income population with a range of trauma exposure. Acoustic startle response data were collected to measure fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in 104 participants. A total of 62 participants were tested with the mother available and 42 when the mother was not in the testing room. We observed that maternal availability during fear conditioning interacted with age to affect FPS discrimination between CS+ and CS-. In line with previous findings suggesting an absence of maternal buffering in adolescents, fear discrimination was affected by maternal availability only in children. Second, we observed that the effect of maternal buffering on FPS discrimination in children was not influenced by maternally reported warmth. In conclusion, we demonstrated that maternal availability improved discrimination in children, regardless of the quality of the relationship. Adolescents discriminated irrespective of maternal status, suggesting that childhood may be a sensitive period for environmental influences on key processes such as learning of danger and safety signals.","[van Rooij, Sanne J.

The repeated presentation of a conditioned stimulus in the absence of a reinforcer leads to a decrease in fear respondinga phenomenon known as extinction. From a translational perspective, identifying whether an individual might respond well to extinction prior to intervention could prove important to treatment outcomes. Here, we test the hypothesis that CO2 reactivity predicts extinction phenotype in rats, and that variability in CO2 reactivity as well as extinction long-term memory (LTM) significantly predicts orexin activity in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Our results validate a rat model of CO2 reactivity and show that subcomponents of behavioral reactivity following acute CO2 exposure explain a significant portion of the variance in extinction LTM. Furthermore, we show evidence that variability in CO2 reactivity is also significantly predictive of orexin activity in the LH, and that orexin activity, in turn, significantly accounts for LTM variance. Our findings open the possibility that we may be able to use CO2 reactivity as a screening tool to determine if individuals are good candidates for an extinction/exposure-based approach.","[Monfils, M.

The relative strength and availability for retrieval of both the fear and safety memories determine the response in a given situation. While the fear memory is often context-independent and may easily generalize, extinction memory is highly context-specific. Renewal of the extinguished fear memory might thus occur following a shift in context. The aim of the current work was to create an enhanced and generalized extinction memory to a discrete stimulus using stress exposure before extinction learning, thereby preventing renewal. In our contextual fear conditioning paradigm, 40 healthy men acquired (Day 1), retrieved and extinguished (Day 2) the fear memories, with no differences between the stress and the control group. A significant difference between the groups emerged in the renewal test (Day 3). A renewal effect was seen in the control group (N = 20), confirming the context-dependency of the extinction memory. In contrast, the stress group (N = 20) showed no renewal effect. Fear reduction was generalized to the acquisition context as well, suggesting that stress rendered the extinction memory more context-independent. These results are in line with previous studies that showed contextualization disruption as a result of pre-learning stress, mediated by the rapid effects of glucocorticoids on the hippocampus. Our findings support research investigating the use of glucocorticoids or stress induction in exposure therapy and suggest the right timing of administration in order to optimize their effects.","[Drexler, Shira Meir; Merz, Christian J.; Wolf, Oliver T.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Bochum, Germany",,"Wolf, OT (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",Oliver.T.Wolf@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,,"Meir Drexler, Shira/0000-0001-8797-6900; Wolf, Oliver T./0000-0002-9320-2124; Merz, Christian/0000-0001-5679-6595",German Research Foundation (DFG) Research Unit 1581 Extinction Learning; Project A09 of the Collaborative Research Center 1280 Extinction Learning,"This work was supported by project P5 of the German Research Foundation (DFG) Research Unit 1581 Extinction Learning and Project A09 of the Collaborative Research Center 1280 Extinction Learning.

The structure and contents of human factors assessments, the source material and the role of probabilistic safety assessment are described. Similar evaluations are recommended as an integral part of periodic safety reviews of regulated industrial facilities. The qualitative part of the human factors review is structured according to an international guide. The assessments are here enhanced with operating experience evaluations, measured by quantitative statistical data obtained from inspections and assessments made by plant safety and quality assurance personnel, by regulatory authorities and by peer reviews. The quantitative assessment is based on the roles and contributions of human errors in the accident risk of the target plant. The assessment uses importance measures quantified in probabilistic risk assessment. The scope and the quality of the risk assessment and the scope and the quality of human reliability assessments are also taken into account. Furthermore, the assessment describes how risk assessment can be used to reduce errors and improve human factors. The results tend to be very plant-specific, and the errors have very different importances in different operating states and for different initiating event categories. The results are useful for planning preventive actions, i.e. for preventing errors by developing and prioritizing human factors improvement activities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research with rats has demonstrated that secondary extinction can interfere with the return of conditioned fear after a reinstatement manipulation. Here we investigated this phenomenon in two pre-registered studies in humans Method: In both experiments, distinct CSs were paired with an electrical stimulation. Next, conditioned reactions to both CSs were extinguished and thereafter reinstated through the administration of three unsignaled electrical stimulations. Crucially, before participants continued with the reinstatement test, half of the participants received secondary extinction trials whereas the other half did not receive these trials. Results: Our results indicate that secondary extinction reduced reinstatement of threat expectancies and skin conductance responses, but the effect on skin conductance was only found in the second experiment. Limitations: The studies were conducted in a laboratory setting with healthy students. Additional research will be required to determine the feasibility of applying secondary extinction in a (sub)clinical context. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of secondary extinction and its effect on reinstatement of conditioned fear in humans. We relate our findings to the earlier research with rats and discuss their relevance for exposure therapy.","[Mertens, Gaetan; Leer, Arne; van Dis, Eva Anna Maria; Vermeer, Lotte; Steenhuizen, Anne; van der Veen, Lisa; Engelhard, Iris M.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1,Room H1-29, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Mertens, G (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1,Room H1-29, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",g.mertens@uu.nl,"Mertens, Gatan/ABC-3386-2021","Mertens, Gatan/0000-0003-1923-6657",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO VICI)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [453-15-005],"The research reported in this paper was supported by a grant of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO VICI; grant number: 453-15-005) awarded to Iris M.

Mainstreaming disaster risk is hence seen as an important global agenda as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2015-2030. Yet, conventional development indicators remain largely negligent of the potential setbacks that may be posed by disaster risk. This article discusses the need to reflect disaster risk in development indicators and proposes a concept disaster risk-adjusted human development index (RHDI) as an example. Globally available national-level datasets of disaster risk to public and private assets (including health, educational facilities, and private housing) is combined with an estimate of expenditure on health, education, and capital formation to construct an RHDI. The RHDI is then analyzed across various regions and HDI groups, and contrasted with other HDI variants including inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) and the gender-specific female HDI (FHDI) to identify groups of countries where transformational disaster risk reduction (DRR) approaches may be necessary.","[Mochizuki, Junko; Naqvi, Asjad] IIASA, Risk & Resilience Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Naqvi, Asjad] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Inst Ecol Econ, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",,"Mochizuki, J (corresponding author), IIASA, Risk & Resilience Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",mochizuk@iiasa.ac.at; naqvi@iiasa.ac.at,"Naqvi, Asjad/AAP-5034-2021; Naqvi, Asjad/AAE-2793-2019","Naqvi, Asjad/0000-0002-0986-6009; Mochizuki, Junko/0000-0003-1000-4251",Structuralist Macroeconomic Modeling of Disaster Risk and Sustainable Development Goals (MACRO) by the Austrian National Bank Anniversary Fund (Jubilaumsfondsproject) [17390],This work is partly funded under Structuralist Macroeconomic Modeling of Disaster Risk and Sustainable Development Goals (MACRO) funded by the Austrian National Bank Anniversary Fund (Jubilaumsfondsproject Nr. 17390).,,72,3,3,7,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2019,11,4,,,,,,,996,10.3390/su11040996,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HO3JV,WOS:000460819100056,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-04-16,

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) enhance neural plasticity and their ability to enhance fear extinction learning may explain their anxiolytic properties. Caloric restriction (CR) has SSRI-like effects on neural plasticity and anxiety-related behavior. We implemented CR in mice to determine its effects on conditioned-fear responses. Wild type and serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout mice underwent CR for 7 days leading to significant weight loss. Mice were then tested for cued fear learning and anxiety-related behavior. CR markedly enhanced fear extinction learning and its retention in adolescent female mice, and adults of both sexes. These effects of CR were absent in SERT knockout mice. Moreover, CR phenocopied behavioral and molecular effects of chronic fluoxetine, but there was no additive effect of CR in fluoxetine-treated mice. These results demonstrate that CR enhances fear extinction learning through a SERT-dependent mechanism.

Background: Previous studies have suggested that the perception of fear in facial expressions is mediated by a specialized neural system that includes the amygdala and certain posterior right-hemisphere cortical legions. However, the neuropsychological findings in patients with amygdala damage are inconclusive, and the contribution of distinct cortical regions to fear perception has only been examined in one study. Methods: We studied the recognition of six basic facial expressions by asking subjects to match-these emotions with the appropriate verbal labels. Results: Both normal control subjects (n = 80) and patients with focal brain damage (n = 63) performed significantly worse in recognizing fear than in recognizing any other facial emotion, with errors consisting primarily of mistaking fear for surprise. Although patients were impaired relative to control subjects in recognizing fear, we could not obtain convincing evidence that left, right, or bilateral lesions were associated with disproportionate impairments of fear perception once we adjusted for differences in overall recognition performance for the other five facial emotion categories. The proposed special role of the amygdala and posterior right-hemisphere cortical regions in fear perception was also not supported. Conclusions: Fear recognition deficits in neurologic patients may be attributable to task difficulty factors rather than damage to putative neural systems dedicated to fear perception.","Vet Adm Med Ctr, Neurol Sect 1 127, Tucson, AZ 85723 USA; Vet Adm Med Ctr, Psychol Serv, Tucson, AZ 85723 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ USA; Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Memory Disorders Res Ctr, Boston, MA USA; Brown Univ, Dept Psychol, Providence, RI 02912 USA",,"Rapcsak, SZ (corresponding author), Vet Adm Med Ctr, Neurol Sect 1 127, 3601 S 6th Ave, Tucson, AZ 85723 USA.",,,"Verfaellie, Mieke/0000-0001-5535-4584",,,,28,119,119,2,22,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0028-3878,,,NEUROLOGY,Neurology,FEB 8,2000,54,3,,,,,575,581,,10.1212/WNL.54.3.575,,,7,Clinical Neurology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,281KZ,WOS:000085160300007,10680785,,,,2022-04-16,

The following risks were considered: possible major accidents, radioactive substances and radiation, several carcinogenic substances in air and environmental noise, with the methods used based on the risk concept implemented in the Netherlands environmental policy. Starting with information on sources and emissions of several contaminants, their dispersion in air and human exposure to them were calculated, and the effects on human health estimated. The results were presented in a number of national maps. In spite of the complexity of discussions on risk-related subjects, applying the methods developed during the project has been shown to lead to insight into the geographical distribution and the comparison of different kinds of risk. The maps on possible major accidents and noise showed high risks on a local scale, whereas the risks due to radiation and substances were found to be more evenly distributed over large parts of the Netherlands.

The effect on acquisition was dependent on the dose given. BDP-12-treated rats and vehicle-treated controls reached the same level of conditioned fear and extinguished at the same rate. The dissociation of learning rate from these other normally covariant measures suggests that the drug had a specific and isolated effect on acquisition. Controls for drug effects on stimulus sensitivity, locomotor activity, generalized fearfulness, and other performance factors support this interpretation, the known action of BDP-12 on receptor dynamics suggests that its effect on acquisition. may be attributed to specific modulation of an AMPA and NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity mechanism. The finding that the drug accelerates acquisition but does not affect the level of conditioned fear acquired parallels the effect of the drug on long-term potentiation (LTP) (increasing the rate but not the ceiling of potentiation) and suggests that common mechanisms may underlie fear conditioning and LTP.","NYU,CTR NEURAL SCI,NEW YORK,NY 10003",,,,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37 MH38824, K02 MH0096, R01 MH46517] Funding Source: Medline",,,47,65,67,0,5,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

These studies established a predominant role for the amygdala in fear acquisition, while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been shown to be important in the extinction of conditioned fear. However, studies on morphological correlates of fear learning could not consistently confirm an association with these structures. The objective of the present study was to investigate if interindividual differences in morphology of the amygdala and the vmPFC are related to differences in fear acquisition and extinction learning in humans. We performed structural magnetic resonance imaging in 68 healthy participants who underwent a differential cued fear conditioning paradigm. Volumes of subcortical structures as well as cortical thickness were computed by the semi-automated segmentation software Freesurfer. Stronger acquisition of fear as indexed by skin conductance responses was associated with larger right amygdala volume, while the degree of extinction learning was positively correlated with cortical thickness of the right vmPFC. Both findings could be conceptually replicated in an independent sample of 53 subjects. The data complement our understanding of the role of human brain morphology in the mechanisms of the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear.","[Winkelmann, Tobias; Grimm, Oliver; Pohlack, Sebastian T.; Nees, Frauke; Cacciaglia, Raffaele; Dinu-Biringer, Ramona; Steiger, Frauke; Wicking, Manon; Flor, Herta] Heidelberg Univ, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Med Fac Mannheim, Dept Cognit & Clin Neurosci, Sq J 5, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Ruttorf, Michaela; Schad, Lothar R.] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Comp Assisted Clin Med, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany",,"Flor, H (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Med Fac Mannheim, Dept Cognit & Clin Neurosci, Sq J 5, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",herta.flor@zi-mannheim.de,"Nees, Frauke/AAZ-2150-2020; /ABD-6198-2020; Cacciaglia, Raffaele/K-9318-2019; Cacciaglia, Raffaele/X-1939-2019","Cacciaglia, Raffaele/0000-0002-9216-949X; Grimm, Oliver/0000-0002-0767-0301; Winkelmann, Tobias/0000-0001-7743-1894; , Mica/0000-0002-0523-6878; Nees, Frauke/0000-0002-7796-8234; Flor, Herta/0000-0003-4809-5398","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 636/C01, SFB 636/Z03]","We thank Stephanie Ridder, Slawomira Diener, Claudia Liebscher, Birgul Sarun, Claudia Stief and Bettina Kirr for assistance in data acquisition.

Patients with anxiety problems show overgeneralization of learned fear, as reflected by defensive physiological responses to harmless stimuli. Together with these physiological responses, conscious feeling of fear is a seminal part of emotional process that is directly related to the suffering of anxiety patients. However, the effect of anxiety on the generalization of conscious feeling remains unclear. We thus focused on the question whether the generalization of conscious feeling of fear depends on individual anxiety level in nonpatient participants. To address this question, we developed a fear generalization paradigm using natural scene images. We found that subjective feeling of fear was generalized to similar stimuli with the conditioned stimuli (CS), and that this generalization of conscious fear was positively correlated with the level of individual anxiety. Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur, but the individual depression level was not correlated with the fear generalization. These suggest that individual anxiety level mainly affects the generalization of conscious fear.","[Park, Doyoung; Lee, Hwa-Jin; Lee, Sue-Hyun] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Dept Bio & Brain Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Lee, Sue-Hyun] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Program Brain & Cognit Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea",,"Lee, SH (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Dept Bio & Brain Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.; Lee, SH (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Program Brain & Cognit Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.",suelee@kaist.ac.kr,"Lee, Sue-Hyun/F-5490-2015","Lee, Sue-Hyun/0000-0002-5318-5657",Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health Welfare [HI15C3175]; Basic Science Research Program [NRF-2016R1C1B2010726]; Brain Research Program through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea [NRF-2017M3C7A1031333]; Undergraduate Research Program of KAIST,"This work was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare (HI15C3175), the Basic Science Research Program (NRF-2016R1C1B2010726), and the Brain Research Program (NRF-2017M3C7A1031333) through the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea, and the Undergraduate Research Program of KAIST.

Methods: This feasibility study was conducted in a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial on 24 nulliparous women with FOC between July and October 2018. The women received five sessions of psychoeducation and four sessions of antenatal education. The primary outcome was the level of FOC in prenatal period, and the secondary outcomes were the rate of preference for vaginal birth (VB) in prenatal period, the rate of VB, and the level of FOC in postnatal period. The level of the FOC was assessed using Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire A and B. Results: Although the levels of FOC of the women decreased in both groups for post-treatment, the decrease in the psychoeducation group was significantly higher compared to the antenatal education group (p = 0.022). In the postnatal period, the level of FOC of psychoeducation group was statistically lower than that of the antenatal education group (p = 0.000). Furthermore, all the women in the psychoeducation group and 58.33% of the women in the antenatal education group wanted to have a VB at the end of the program (p = 0.012). However, there was statistically no difference between the groups in terms of the birth type (p = 0.342). Conclusions: There seems to be an indication that the psychoeducation program based on Human Caring Theory might have a benefit to reduce the level of FOC of women compared to the antenatal education classes.","[Boz, Ilkay; Akgun, Mehtap] Akdeniz Univ, Nursing Fac, Antalya, Turkey; [Duman, Ferdane] Hlth Sci Univ, Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Antalya, Turkey",,"Boz, I (corresponding author), Akdeniz Univ, Nursing Fac, Antalya, Turkey.",ilkayarslan@akdeniz.edu.tr,"Boz, ?lkay/C-5252-2016; Akgn, Mehtap/I-7048-2017","Boz, ?lkay/0000-0002-3529-9351; ",,,,47,2,2,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0167-482X,1743-8942,,J PSYCHOSOM OBST GYN,J.

We propose that avoidance behavior is a relevant factor that prevents subjects from obtaining new safety information during reconsolidation. Postretrieval extinction training without avoidance behavior reduced the fear response to conditioned stimulus and prevented spontaneous recovery in the current study, which corresponded with previous studies. Under the condition of postretrieval extinction training with avoidance behavior, the fear response was not reduced as much as it was in the condition without avoidance.

Approximately two million children in the United States experience the death of a sibling each year, leaving 25% of them in need of clinical intervention and more than 50% with significant behavioral problems. Fear, guilt, anxiety, and even distance from parents are some of the reactions that children feel after experiencing the loss of a sibling. The purpose of this study was to describe children's fears 2-13 months after their sibling's death. Fears were examined by children's age, gender, race/ethnicity, and time. Methods: Children completed two open-ended questions about fears and five fear items on the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale. The sample consisted of 132 children. Results: Children's top fears across age, gender, and race/ethnicity were daily situations (such as darkness, high places, and violent situations), bugs, animals, and medical examinations. Girls had more total fears than boys. These included fears of bugs and situations with parents and siblings. Boys and Hispanic children had more fears of daily situations. Black children had more fears of animals, whereas White children had more fears of bugs and medical examinations. Implications for practice: Children identify many fears after sibling death, including but not limited to fantasy creatures, common daily situations, bugs, animals, and medical examinations likely related to their sibling's death. Identifying children's fears early can help nurse practitioners assist families in better understanding and responding to children's behavior after sibling death.","[Roche, Rosa M.; Brooten, Dorothy; Youngblut, JoAnne M.] Florida Int Univ, Nicole Wertheim Coll Nursing & Hlth Sci, 11200 SW 8th St,AHC3,Rm 223, Miami, FL 33199 USA",,"Roche, RM (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Nicole Wertheim Coll Nursing & Hlth Sci, 11200 SW 8th St,AHC3,Rm 223, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",rroche@fiu.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Nursing ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [R01 NR012675]","Funded by grant #R01 NR012675 from the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Nursing Research.",,35,1,1,1,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",2327-6886,2327-6924,,J AM ASSOC NURSE PRA,J.

To exclude a focus on elements of the context we employed a paradigm, which uses two feature-identical contexts that only differ in the arrangement of the features and requires configural processing. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the role of the hippocampus and neocortical areas during the acquisition of contextual fear in humans. For contextual fear acquisition, we paired one context (CS+) with an aversive electrical stimulus, whereas the other (CS-) was never followed by aversive stimulation. Blood oxygen level dependent activation to the CS+ was present in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior medial gyrus and caudate nucleus. Furthermore, the amygdala and hippocampus were involved in a time-dependent manner. Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed functional connectivity of a more posterior hippocampal seed region with the anterior hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior parietal lobule. The anterior hippocampus was functionally coupled with the amygdala and postcentral gyrus.

This study investigated the molecular mechanisms of intrahippocampally administered D-cycloserine in facilitating fear extinction in a contextual fear conditioning animal model. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 120) were grouped into four experimental groups (n = 30) based on fear conditioning and intrahippocampal administration of either DCS or saline. The light/dark avoidance test was used to differentiate maladapted (MA) (anxious) from well-adapted (WA) (not anxious) subgroups. RNA extracted from the left dorsal hippocampus was used for RNA sequencing and gene expression data was compared between six fear-conditioned + saline MA (FEAR + SALINE MA) and six fear-conditioned + DCS WA (FEAR + DCS WA) animals. Of the 424 significantly downregulated and 25 significantly upregulated genes identified in the FEAR + DCS WA group compared to the FEAR + SALINE MA group, 121 downregulated and nine upregulated genes were predicted to be relevant to fear conditioning and anxiety and stress-related disorders. The majority of downregulated genes transcribed immune, proinflammatory and oxidative stress systems molecules. These molecules mediate neuroinflammation and cause neuronal damage. DCS also regulated genes involved in learning and memory processes, and genes associated with anxiety, stress-related disorders and co-occurring diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, digestive system diseases and nervous system diseases). Identifying the molecular underpinnings of DCS-mediated fear extinction brings us closer to understanding the process of fear extinction.","[Malan-Mueller, Stefanie; Fairbairn, Lorren; Seedat, Soraya; Hemmings, Sian Megan Joanna] Univ Stellenbosch, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Psychiat, Cape Town, South Africa; [Daniels, Willie M.

This line of fear conditioning research impacts the proposed onset of psychological interventions after threatening situations. In the present study, forty healthy men were investigated in a differential fear conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition in context A, extinction in context B, followed by retrieval testing in both contexts 24 h later to test fear renewal. Differently coloured lights served as conditioned stimuli (CS): two CS (CS+) were paired with an electrical stimulation that served as unconditioned stimulus, the third CS was never paired (CS-). Extinction took place immediately after fear acquisition or 24 h later. One CS+ was extinguished whereas the second CS+ remained unextinguished to control for different time intervals between fear acquisition and retrieval testing. Immediate extinction led to larger skin conductance responses during fear retrieval to both the extinguished and unextinguished CS relative to the CS-, indicating a stronger return of fear compared to delayed extinction. Taken together, immediate extinction is less potent than delayed extinction and is associated with a stronger renewal effect. Thus, the time-point of psychological interventions relative to the offset of threatening situations needs to be carefully considered to prevent relapses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The maladaptive behavior related to primary psychopathy is thought to reflect constitutional fearlessness, while the problematic behavior related to secondary psychopathy is motivated by other factors. The fearlessness observed in psychopathy has often been interpreted as reflecting a fundamental deficit in amygdala function, and previous studies have provided support for a low-fear model of psychopathy. However, many of these studies fail to use appropriate screening procedures, use liberal inclusion criteria, or have used unconventional approaches to assay amygdala function. We measured brain activity with BOLD imaging in primary and secondary psychopaths and non-psychopathic control subjects during Pavlovian fear conditioning. In contrast to the low-fear model, we observed normal fear expression in primary psychopaths. Psychopaths also displayed greater differential BOLD activity in the amygdala relative to matched controls. Inverse patterns of activity were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for primary versus secondary psychopaths. Primary psychopaths exhibited a pattern of activity in the dorsal and ventral ACC consistent with enhanced fear expression, while secondary psychopaths exhibited a pattern of activity in these regions consistent with fear inhibition. These results contradict the low-fear model of psychopathy and suggest that the low fear observed for psychopaths in previous studies may be specific to secondary psychopaths.","[Schultz, Douglas H.; Balderston, Nicholas L.; Larson, Christine L.; Helmstetter, Fred J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Baskin-Sommers, Arielle R.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT USA; [Larson, Christine L.; Helmstetter, Fred J.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Neurol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA",,"Schultz, DH; Helmstetter, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.; Helmstetter, FJ (corresponding author), Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Neurol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.",dhschultz29@gmail.com; fjh@uwm.edu,"Schultz, Douglas/AAB-2365-2020; Balderston, Nicholas/U-9126-2019","Schultz, Douglas/0000-0003-0809-9036; Balderston, Nicholas/0000-0002-8565-1544",University of Wisconsin-Madison/University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Intercampus Grant,This study was supported by a University of Wisconsin-Madison/University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Intercampus Grant.,,57,16,16,0,34,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

This learning process is dependent upon plastic interactions between the amygdala, the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), the hippocampus, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). With regard to the amygdala, the basolateral (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) serve unique roles in fear extinction. In a large sample (N = 91), the current study examined pre- to post-extinction changes in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of fear inhibition and expression pathways. We also examined how trait anxiety and extinction performance were associated with extinction-related changes within these neural pathways. We found stronger pre- to post-extinction RSFC in pathways known to play a role in the down-regulation of fear responses (BLA-hippocampus, aMCC-hippocampus, CMA-hippocampus, CMA-aMCC). We also found that trait anxiety was associated with strengthening of a BLA-aMCC circuit supporting fear expression following extinction learning. Furthermore, we found that physiological indices of poorer extinction learning were linked to weaker pre- to post-extinction RSFC of a BLA-hippocampus pathway important for fear extinction consolidation. Our results highlight the network changes that occur during extinction, the separable role of CMA and BLA-based circuitry and a key pathway linked to risk for anxiety pathology.","[Belleau, Emily L.] McLean Hosp, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Belleau, Emily L.] Harvard Med Sch, 25 Shattuck St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pedersen, Walker S.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Hlth Minds, 625 W Washington Ave, Madison, WI 53703 USA; [Miskovich, Tara A.] VA Northern Calif Healthcare Syst, 201 Walnut Ave, Vallejo, CA 94592 USA; [Helmstetter, Fred J.; Larson, Christine L.] Univ Wisconsin, 2441 E Hartford Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA",,"Belleau, EL (corresponding author), McLean Hosp, Ctr Depress Anxiety & Stress Res, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02478 USA.",belleauel@gmail.com,,,"Livingston Award (Harvard Medical School); Adam J.

These disorders can be grouped in fear and distress disorders. Aim of this study was to study the association between fear and distress disorders with subsequent heart disease, taking into account the temporal order of disorders. Methods: Twenty household surveys were conducted in 18 countries (n = 53791; person years = 2,212,430). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of disorders, and respondents were categorized into categories based on the presence and timing of fear and distress disorders. Heart disease was indicated by self-report of physician-diagnosed heart disease or self-report of heart attack, together with year of onset. Survival analyses estimated associations between disorder categories and heart disease. Results: Most respondents with fear or distress disorders had either pure distress or pure fear (8.5% and 7.7% of total sample), while fear preceded distress in the large majority of respondents with comorbid fear and distress (3.8% of total sample). Compared to the no fear or distress disorder category, respondents with pure fear disorder had the highest odds of subsequent heart disease (OR:1.8; 95%CI:1.5-2.2; p < 0.001) and compared to respondents with pure distress disorder, these respondents were at a significantly increased risk of heart disease (OR:1.3; 95%CI:1.0-1.6; p = 0.020). Conclusion This novel analytic approach indicates that the risk of subsequent self-reported heart disease associated with pure fear disorder is significantly larger than the risk associated with distress disorder. These results should be confirmed in prospective studies using objective measures of heart disease.","[Roest, A.

Previously we showed enhanced amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning in mGluR4(-/-) mice 24 h following training involving two tone-shock pairings. In this study, we assessed the effects of modulating mGluR4 signaling on acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. mGluR4(-/-) and wild-type female and male mice received 10 tone-shock pairings during training. Compared to wild-type mice, mGluR4(-/-) mice showed enhanced acquisition and extinction of cued fear. Next, we assessed whether acute pharmacological stimulation of mGluR4 with the specific orthosteric mGluR4 agonist LSP1-2111 also affects acquisition and extinction of cued fear. Consistent with the enhanced acquisition of cued fear in mGluR4-/-, LSP1-2111, at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, inhibited acquisition of cued fear conditioning in wild-type male mice. The drug's effect on extinction was less clear and only a subtle effect was seen at 5 mg/kg. Finally, analysis of microarray data of amygdala tissues from mGluR4(-/-) versus wild-type and from wild-type mice treated with a mGluR4 agonist versus saline revealed a significant overlap in pattern of gene expression. Together, these data support a role for mGluR4 signaling in acquisition of fear learning and memory. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors'.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that novel and startling stimuli may trigger fear-induced aggression. The aim of the present study was to study some possible behavioural and physiological measures of fear in the dog Canis familiaris in tests involving novel and startling stimuli. Dogs (n = 108) of various breeds, sex and experience were observed in four tests previously reported to induce fear-related responses in various animal species. A range of behavioural and physiological variables was recorded, such as latencies to approach the stimulus, time spent near stimulus and heart rate changes. Data were examined using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PICA). Moderate to high correlations were found between some of the variables within and between the tests and a number of variables were identified in three components determined by the PCA. These three components accounted for 48% of the total variation and components 1 and 3 contained high loadings for the latency to approach and time spent near the stimulus in a novel object test and a startling test, respectively. Component 2 contained variables measuring latencies and entries to areas in a light/dark test and an elevated plus maze test. It is suggested that component 1 may be a measure of a response to novelty and component 3 may be a measure of a response to startling stimuli, while component 2 may be a measure of exploration. Components I and 3 may thus be appropriate measures of different aspects of fear. The suitability of each test and its limitations in measuring fear of novel and startling stimuli in the dog are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A prime example is the continuing civil war in Syria, during which Turkey has become the host country for more Syrian refugees than any other country in the region. Research on fear of crime has focused mainly on fear of crime in general rather than on fear of crime being committed by specific groups of individuals with a shared identity. The current study used survey data to investigate the extent to which the general crime fear among Turkish citizens differs from their fear that Syrian refugees in the country may commit a crime. Consistent with theoretical assumptions of subgroup threats, the overall results of the study show that Turkish citizens' relational discomfort with Syrians, their perception that Syrian refugees pose a security threat, and their encounters with Syrian refugees in their neighborhoods are significantly associated with the manifestation of fear of general and group-specific crime. Fear of both types of crime was higher among females, which is consistent with previous research; however, contrary to previous research, young people rather than elderly people were more fearful of crime.","[Akyuz, Kadir] Univ Bridgeport, Bridgeport, CT USA; [Akbas, Halil] Troy Univ, Troy, AL USA; [Onat, Ismail] Univ Scranton, Scranton, PA 18510 USA",,"Akyuz, K (corresponding author), Univ Bridgeport, Dept Criminal Justice & Human Secur, 303 Univ Ave, Bridgeport, CT 06604 USA.",kakyuz@bridgeport.edu,,"Akyuz, Kadir/0000-0002-4796-972X",,,,67,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1477-3708,1741-2609,,EUR J CRIMINOL,Eur.

These experiments studied the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment on the contextual versus auditory fear memory of mice. We found that chronic fluoxetine treatment of adult mice impaired their contextual fear memory, but spared auditory fear memory. Hippocampal perineuronal nets, which are involved in contextual fear memory plasticity, were unaltered by fluoxetine treatment. These data point to a selective inability to form contextual fear memory as a result of fluoxetine treatment, and they suggest that a blunting of hippocampal-mediated aversive memory may be a therapeutic action for this medication.

An adaptive learning system should therefore extract relevant features from threat stimuli to successfully detect other novel threats in the environment. But what if the most relevant feature of a threat stimulus is emotionally positive? Here, we used Pavlovian fear conditioning to ask whether people extract positive emotional features of a fear conditioned stimulus (CS) to selectively generalize to other stimuli that contain positive features. In a between subjects design, we first paired a picture of a face expressing either a slight amount of happiness or fear with an electrical shock to the wrist. We then tested fear generalization to modified face stimuli of the same identity expressing more or less happiness or fear. Both groups exhibited biased physiological arousal (a peak shift) to a face stimulus with the most exaggerated emotional expression, regardless of valence. Fear generalization diminished to unreinforced happy faces over the course of testing, whereas arousal was maintained to unreinforced fearful faces throughout testing. Finally, subjects fear conditioned to a slightly happy face were accurate at retrospectively identifying the correct CS, whereas subjects fear conditioned to a fearful face retrospectively misidentified a more fearful face as the threat CS. These findings suggest that positive emotional features extracted from a known threat can guide biased fear generalization, but that generalization is maintained by a dimension of increasing fear which also produces retrospective biases in threat intensity estimation.","[McClay, Mason; Reidel, Alex; Dunsmoor, Joseph E.] Univ Texas Austin, Dell Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hennings, Augustin C.; Dunsmoor, Joseph E.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Dunsmoor, JE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dell Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",joseph.dunsmoor@austin.utexas.edu,,,National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R00 MH106719],"We thank our colleague, Sam Cooper, for statistical assistance.

It is defined as enhanced fear responding to a stimulus that bears similarities, but is not identical to a threatening stimulus. Pattern separation, a hippocampal-dependent process, is critical for stimulus discrimination; it transforms similar experiences or events into non-overlapping representations. This study is the first in humans to investigate the extent to which fear generalization relies on behavioral pattern separation abilities. Participants (N = 46) completed a behavioral task taxing pattern separation, and a neuroimaging fear conditioning and generalization paradigm. Results show an association between lower behavioral pattern separation performance and increased generalization in shock expectancy scores, but not in fear ratings. Furthermore, lower behavioral pattern separation was associated with diminished recruitment of the subcallosal cortex during presentation of generalization stimuli. This region showed functional connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Together, the data provide novel experimental evidence that pattern separation is related to generalization of threat expectancies, and reduced fear inhibition processes in frontal regions. Deficient pattern separation may be critical in overgeneralization and therefore may contribute to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and PTSD.","[Lange, Iris; Goossens, Liesbet; Michielse, Stijn; Bakker, Jindra; Verhagen, Simone; Leibold, Nicole; Marcelis, Machteld; Lieverse, Ritsaert; van Os, Jim; van Amelsvoort, Therese; Schruers, Koen] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Psychol, Sch Mental Hlth & Neurosci,EURON, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Lissek, Shmuel] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Papalini, Silvia] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Marcelis, Machteld] Inst Mental Hlth Care Eindhoven GGzE, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Wichers, Marieke] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Psychiat, Interdisciplinary Ctr Psychopathol & Emot Regulat, Groningen, Netherlands; [van Os, Jim] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychosis Studies, Kings Hlth Partners, London, England; [Schruers, Koen] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol, Ctr Expt & Learning Psychol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Lange, I (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Psychol, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",i.lange@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Wichers, Marieke/N-6667-2014; van Os, Jim/V-8884-2019; Michielse, Stijn/H-9020-2019; van Os, Jim/C-2113-2014; Schruers, Koen/AAV-2922-2021; Verhagen, Simone/AAL-3706-2020","Wichers, Marieke/0000-0001-5024-9064; van Os, Jim/0000-0002-7245-1586; Michielse, Stijn/0000-0003-3930-8646; Schruers, Koen/0000-0003-0134-406X; Verhagen, Simone/0000-0002-5364-6994; Lange, Iris/0000-0002-6251-8978; Leibold, Nicole/0000-0003-2347-5423; Marcelis, Machteld/0000-0003-0045-9244; Lissek, Shmuel/0000-0001-7384-371X",Stichting the Weijerhorst,This study was funded by a research grant from Stichting the Weijerhorst.,,58,31,32,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1749-5016,1749-5024,,SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR,Soc.

Methods This study was a cross-sectional analysis of 64 participants at a primary care facility in the western United States of America. The following fall risk factors were examined for differences between groups (fallers vs. non-fallers): age, body mass index, depression, fear of falling, neuropathy, number of medications, sedentary behavior, and visual co-morbidities. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine relationships with self-reported falls (yes/no recent fall as defined by the participant). Results Forty-five percent of participants reported a recent fall. The following fall risk factors produced significant differences between fallers and non-fallers: depression scores (p = .01), fear of falling (p < .01), and number of medications currently being taken (p = .04). Through multivariate logistic regression, the fear of falling score (p < .01) was the only significant relationship with self-reported falls in the model that included age, body mass index, depression, fear of falling, neuropathy, number of medications, sedentary behavior, and visual co-morbidities. Conclusion Psychological fall risk factors such as fear of falling are factors that should be considered early on in a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus because they may have an effect on falls, as evidenced in this sample of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged under 65 years.","[Swink, Laura A.; Schmid, Arlene A.; Atler, Karen E.; Klinedinst, Tara C.; Malcolm, Matthew P.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Marchant, Tasha P.; Marchant, David R.] Univ Colorado Hlth, Ft Collins Family Med Residency Program, Ft Collins, CO USA",,"Swink, LA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Occupat Therapy, Coll Hlth & Human Sci, Box 1573, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",laura.anita.swink@gmail.com,"Malcolm, Dr. Matt/AAY-2482-2021","Schmid, Arlene/0000-0002-7755-199X","Program of Research & Scholarly Excellence mini-grant, Department of Occupational Therapy, Colorado State University","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded through the Program of Research & Scholarly Excellence mini-grant, Department of Occupational Therapy, Colorado State University.",,32,0,0,4,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0308-0226,1477-6006,,BRIT J OCCUP THER,Br.

DCS also enhanced CS-evoked neural responses in a posterior hippocampus/collateral sulcus region and in the medial prefrontal cortex at test.

In the near future, first-in-human trials (FIH) will be indicated. FIH trials mark a key milestone in the translation of medical SynBio applications into clinical practice. Fostered by uncertainty of possible adverse events for trial participants, a variety of ethical concerns emerge with regards to SynBio FIH trials, including 'risk' minimization. These concerns are associated with any FIH trial, however, due to the novelty of the approach, they become more pronounced for medical applications of emerging technologies (emTech) like SynBio. To minimize potential harm for trial participants, scholars, guidelines, regulations and policy makers alike suggest using 'risk assessment' as evaluation tool for such trials. Conversely, in the context of emTech FIH trials, we believe it to be at least questionable to contextualize uncertainty of potential adverse events as 'risk' and apply traditional risk assessment methods. Hence, this issue needs to be discussed to enable alterations of the evaluation process before the translational phase of SynBio applications begins. In this paper, we will take the opportunity to start the debate and highlight how a misunderstanding of the concept of risk, and the possibilities and limitations of risk assessment, respectively, might impair decision-making by the relevant regulatory authorities and research ethics committees, and discuss possible solutions to tackle the issue.","[Genske, Anna] Univ Cologne, Forsch Stelle Eth, CERES Cologne Ctr Eth Rights Econ & Social Sci Hl, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Engel-Glatter, Sabrina] Univ Basel, Inst Bio & Med Eth, Bernoullistr 28, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",,"Engel-Glatter, S (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Bio & Med Eth, Bernoullistr 28, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",anna.genske@uk-koeln.de; sabrina.engel@unibas.ch,,,National Swiss Science Foundation (SNF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),We thank the National Swiss Science Foundation (SNF) for supporting the work of Anna Genske with the Pro-doc Grant Risk benefit evaluation of first-in-human trials in synthetic biology and nanomedicine''.,,99,8,8,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-7423,1572-8633,,MED HEALTH CARE PHIL,Med.

However, the mechanisms by which FOF influence postural stability are poorly understood. In the current article, we use psychological theory to explain FOF-related changes to postural control. First, we review literature describing associations between FOF and the 'stiffening' strategies observed during control of posture, including observations of eye and head movements. Second, we present a framework illustrating the interactions between increased age, FOF, and altered attentional processes, which in turn influence balance performance and fall-risk. Psychological theory predicts that anxiety can cause attentional bias for threatening and task-irrelevant stimuli and compromise the efficiency of working memory resources. We argue that while the adoption of stiffening strategies is likely to be beneficial in avoiding a loss of balance during simple postural tasks, it will ultimately compromise performance in dynamic and highly demanding functional tasks. The adoption of stiffening strategies leads to inadequate acquisition of the sensory information necessary to plan and execute dynamic and interactive movements. We conclude with some suggestions for future research. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Young, William R.; Williams, A.

Two core characteristics of pathologic fear are its rapid onset and resistance to cognitive regulation. We hypothesized that activation of the amygdala early in the presentation of fear-relevant visual stimuli would distinguish phobics from nonphobics. Methods: Chronometry of amygdala activation to phobia-relevant pictures was assessed in 13 spider phobics and 14 nonphobics using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the amygdala early in picture processing consistently differentiated between phobic and nonphobic subjects, as well as between phobogenic and nonphobogenic stimuli among phobics. Furthermore, amygdalar BOLD responses associated with timing but not magnitude of activation predicted affective responses to phobogenic stimuli. Computational modeling procedures were used to identify patterns of neural activation in the amygdala that could yield the observed BOLD data. These data suggest that phobic responses were characterized by strong but brief amygdala responses, whereas nonphobic responses were weaker and more sustained. Conclusions: Results are discussed in the context of the amygdala's role in rapid threat detection and the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis of anxiety. These data highlight the importance of examining the neural substrates of the immediate impact of phobogenic stimuli for understanding pathological fear.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Western Psychiat Inst & Clin, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Wyoming, Dept Psychol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Larson, CL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, 105B Psychol Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",larson37@msu.edu,,"Davidson, Richard/0000-0002-8506-4964","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F31-MH12085, K05-MH00875, MH40747, MH43454] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K05MH000875, R37MH043454, F31MH012085, R01MH043454, R01MH040747] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,69,110,114,1,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

We also found that s-carriers have increased trait anxiety due to threat in social evaluation, and ambiguous threat perception.

However aversive events can elicit at least two dissociable subtypes of reactions: fear (transient and relating to an imminent event) and anxiety (diffuse and relating to an unpredictable event). We hypothesised that anxiety might have an opposite effect on time perception compared to fear. To test this we combined a robust anxiety manipulation (threat-of-shock) with a widely used timing task in which participants judged whether the duration of a stimulus was long or short. In line with our hypothesis, across three experiments (with varying stimulus timings and shock levels), participants significantly underestimated time under inducted anxiety, as indicated by a rightward shift of the psychophysical function (meta-analytic effect size: d = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.94). In two further studies, we were unable to replicate previous findings that fear leads to time overestimation, after adapting our temporal cognition task, which suggests a dissociation between fear and anxiety on how they affect time perception. Our results suggest that experimentally inducing anxiety leads to underestimating the duration of temporal intervals, which might be a starting point in explaining different subjective experiences of disorders related to fear (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) and anxiety (e.g. generalised anxiety disorder).","[Sarigiannidis, Ioannis; Roiser, Jonathan P.; Robinson, Oliver J.] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, 17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Grillon, Christian; Ernst, Monique] NIH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, 15K North Dr, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",,"Sarigiannidis, I (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, 17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England.",sar.ioannis@gmail.com,"Robinson, Oliver J./B-3646-2011","Robinson, Oliver J./0000-0002-3100-1132; Roiser, Jonathan/0000-0001-8269-1228; Sarigiannidis, Ioannis/0000-0002-1604-7511","Wellcome Trust-NIH PhD studentship [106816/Z/15/Z]; Medical Research Council Career Development AwardUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K024280/1]; Medical Research Foundation Equipment Competition Grant [C0497]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH002798, 01-M-0185, NCT00026559]; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K024280/1] Funding Source: UKRI","This study has been supported by a Wellcome Trust-NIH PhD studentship to IS (106816/Z/15/Z), by a Medical Research Council Career Development Award to O.J.R.

Concepts have two very different relations: thematic relations based on the co-occurrence of events or scenarios, and taxonomic relations based on similarity or shared features. However, it remains unclear whether thematic and taxonomic relationships differentially affect fear generalization. To clarify the underlying cognitive mechanisms of these relations, the current study combined the classical fear conditioning procedure with electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants were conditioned to a neutral word by pairing the presentation of the word with an unpleasant electrical pulse. A different stimulus was not paired with the electrical pulse. Next, during generalization testing, thematically related or taxonomic-related words were presented. Behavioral responses (shock expectancy and response time) and brain responses (event-related potentials [ERP] and oscillation activity) were recorded. Behavioral results showed that taxonomic relations initiated higher shock expectancy compared with thematic relations, and that conceptual relations did not affect response times. Taxonomic relations induced larger P2 components than thematic relations, and danger generalization stimuli initiated smaller P600 components than safe generalization stimuli. In addition, the magnitudes of alpha and beta oscillations were larger for danger generalization stimuli. These results suggested that taxonomic stimuli generalize broader responses compared with thematic relations after fear conditioning. Therefore, we report a possible new electrophysiological evidence for the presentation of fear generalization. These findings aid our understanding of fear generalization at the concept level and have clinical implications for the cognitive treatment of anxiety disorders.","Shenzhen Univ, Res Ctr Brain Funct & Psychol Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Emot & Social Cognit Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; Shenzhen Inst Neurosci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",,"Peng, WW (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Sch Psychol, Nanhai Ave 3688, Shenzhen 518060, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yutian@szu.edu.cn; 18129863069@qq.com; d.yuqian@qq.com; leiyi821@vip.sina.com,,"Peng, Weiwei/0000-0002-4600-0036","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31571153, 31871130, 31871127]; 13th Five-Year Plan of Philosophy and Social Science in Guangdong Province [D18XXL05]","We thank Yanjing.

The growth of human populations is, at the same time, causing degradation of natural habitats and increasing interaction rates of humans with wildlife, such that conservation management routinely considers the effects of human disturbance as tantamount to or surpassing those of predators. The need to simultaneously manage both of these threats is particularly acute in urban areas that are, increasingly, being recognized as global hotspots of wildlife activity. Pressures from altered predator-prey interactions and human activity may each initiate fear responses in prey species above those that are triggered by natural stressors in ecosystems. If fear responses are experienced by prey at elevated levels, on top of responses to multiple environmental stressors, chronic stress impacts may occur. Despite common knowledge of the negative effects of stress, however, it is rare that stress management is considered in conservation, except in intensive ex situ situations such as in captive breeding facilities or zoos. We propose that mitigation of stress impacts on wildlife is crucial for preserving biodiversity, especially as the value of habitats within urban areas increases. As such, we highlight the need for future studies to consider fear and stress in predator-prey ecology to preserve both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, especially in areas where human disturbance occurs. We suggest, in particular, that non-invasive in situ investigations of endocrinology and ethology be partnered in conservation planning with surveys of habitat resources to incorporate and reduce the effects of fear and stress on wildlife.","[Fardell, Loren L.; Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pavey, Chris R.] CSIRO, Land & Water, Winnellie, NT, Australia",,"Fardell, LL (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lfar3796@uni.sydney.edu.au,"Pavey, Chris/AAT-6315-2020; Pavey, Chris/D-7209-2011","Pavey, Chris/0000-0003-2162-8019; Fardell, Loren/0000-0002-8090-854X; Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730",Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment,"This work was supported by a Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment.

Seven case studies demonstrate the application of this holistic approach to the designs of high-rise residential buildings. An incremental risk approach allows for quantification of the impact of human and organizational errors (HOEs) on different fire safety systems. The active systems considered are sprinklers, building occupant warning systems, smoke detectors, and smoke control systems. The paper presents detailed results from T-H-O-Risk modelling for HOEs and risk variations over time utilizing the SD modelling to compare risk acceptance in the seven case studies located in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and UK. Results indicate that HOEs impact risks in active systems up to similar to 33%. Large variations are observed in the reliability of active systems due to HOEs over time. SD results indicate that a small behavioral change in 'risk perception' of a building management team can lead to a very large risk to life variations over time through the self-reinforcing feedback loops. The quantification of difference in expected risk to life due to technical, human, and organizational risks for seven buildings for each of 16 trial designs is a novel aspect of this study. The research is an important contribution to the development of the next generation building codes and risk assessment methods.","[Tan, Samson; Weinert, Darryl; Joseph, Paul; Moinuddin, Khalid] Victoria Univ, Ctr Environm Safety & Risk Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3030, Australia",,"Tan, S; Moinuddin, K (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Ctr Environm Safety & Risk Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3030, Australia.",samson.tan@live.vu.edu.au; Darryl.Weinert@aecom.com; Paul.Joseph@vu.edu.au; khalid.moinuddin@vu.edu.au,"TAN, SAMSON/AAK-7899-2021; Moinuddin, Khalid/J-1087-2017","TAN, SAMSON/0000-0003-0419-3826; JOSEPH, PAUL/0000-0002-5503-9979; Moinuddin, Khalid/0000-0002-1831-6754",,,,49,1,1,9,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

A review of the literature concerning human bites, HIV and AIDS, HIV in saliva, and case examples was performed to examine the current opinion regarding the transmission of HIV via this route.

Several known anxiolytic compounds have been tested as well as several putative anxiolytics. Because results of these studies have been equivocal, the aim of the present study was to examine another pharmacological permutation of the human potentiated startle model by comparing two anxiolytic agents to a non-anxiolytic sedative and placebo. Twenty healthy volunteers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with four sessions in which they received single doses of the anxiolytics alprazolam (1 mg) and pregabalin (200 mg), as well as diphenhydramine (50 mg) as a non-anxiolytic sedative control and placebo. The design included a cued shock condition that presumably evokes fear and an unpredictable shock context condition presumably evoking anxiety. None of the treatments reliably reduced either fear- or anxiety-potentiated startle. Alprazolam and diphenhydramine reduced overall baseline startle. Alprazolam was found to only affect contextual anxiety in a statistical significant way after two subjects who failed to show a contextual anxiety effect in the placebo condition were excluded from the analysis. Pregabalin did not significantly affect any of the physiological measures. The negative findings from this study are discussed in terms of methodological differences between designs and in variability of startle both between and within study participants. Even though fear-potentiated startle may be used to translate preclinical evidence to human populations, methodological issues still hamper the application of this model to early screening of putative anxiolytic drugs.","[Baas, J.

This research calls for landowner education to close this perception-reality gap and encourage more recreation on private lands. Education by itself, however, may be insufficient because of social discourse about a liability crisis. This study tested the social amplification of risk framework to predict landowner fear of injury lawsuits, and recreational access decisions. The study sampled landowners across the four Northern Forest states in the Northeast United States, and found partial support for the social amplification process. Landowner lawsuit fear and access decisions were the product of belief in a liability crisis, perceived adequacy of the laws, parcel size, and familiarity with the laws. The results indicate that outreach efforts should focus on developing a toolkit of management practices tailored to individual landowners that reduce the uncertainty of liability risk. Management implications: 1. The data provided partial evidence for a social amplification process. Residents in New York, where high-profile recreation-related injury lawsuits are far more frequent than other Northern Forest states, were significantly more fearful of lawsuits and more likely to restrict recreational access to their land. 2. The perception of a liability crisis was widely acknowledged among Northern Forest landowners in spite of liability laws that protect landowners. Those who believed more strongly in a liability crisis were more fearful of lawsuits. 3. Those who were more fearful of lawsuits were more likely to impose partial restrictions on recreational access to their land or to completely eliminate all recreational access to their land. The amplification of risk in public discourse about landowner liability has real consequences for recreational access restrictions on private lands. 4. Knowledge of limited liability statutes, however, had no effect on liability fear. Moreover, greater knowledge of liability protections produced more partial access restrictions to recreational access. This suggests that managing recreational risk on private lands requires more than legal solutions and public education efforts about limited liability statutes. 5. Those who believed that limited liability statutes offered adequate landowner protection were less fearful of lawsuits and less likely to restrict all access to their land. This finding suggests that public education efforts should focus more on the performance of the laws, rather than simply on the description and purposes of the law.","[Kuentzel, Walter F.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Aiken Ctr 308E, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Daigle, John J.] Univ Maine, Sch Forest Resources, 221 Nutting Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Chase, Lisa C.] Univ Vermont Extens, 130 Austine Dr,Suite 300, Brattleboro, VT 05301 USA; [Brown, Tommy L.] Cornell Univ, Human Dimens Res Unit, Fernow Hall,Rm 122B, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Kuentzel, WF (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Aiken Ctr 308E, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",walter.kuentzel@uvm.edu,,,Northeastern States Research Cooperative: Public Access to Private Lands for Recreation and Tourism in the Northern Forest,Support for this research was provided by the Northeastern States Research Cooperative: Public Access to Private Lands for Recreation and Tourism in the Northern Forest.,,50,3,3,2,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

Aims: This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning, extinction training, and retention in healthy humans. Methods: The study involved a randomized placebo-controlled, two-group, parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults, age 21-55 recruited from a major metropolitan area. The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24 hours later, and 2 hours after study drug administration. Fear extinction retention was measured 48 hours after extinction training. Participants (N = 34; 70.6% male and 29.4% female) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100 mg MDMA or placebo. All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses. Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs. MDMA was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. Results: Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences. Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group (chi(2) = 7.29, p = 0.007). Conclusion: Although we did not observe the hypothesized facilitation of extinction retention, the findings from this initial human trial provide compelling rationale to continue to explore the potential for MDMA to impact extinction retention.

In Europe, highly dangerous snake species are distributed almost exclusively in the Mediterranean and Caspian areas. While the risk of a snakebite is relatively low in Central Europe, Azerbaijan, on the other hand, has a high occurrence of the deadly venomous Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina). We hypothesize that co-habitation with this dangerous snake has shaped the way in which humans evaluate snake species resembling it. For that purpose, we asked respondents from the Czech Republic and Azerbaijan to rank photographs depicting 36 snake species according to perceived fear and beauty. The results revealed a high cross-cultural agreement in both evaluations (fear r(2) = 0.683, p < 0.0001; beauty: r(2) = 0.816, p < 0.0001). Snakes species eliciting higher fear tend to be also perceived as more beautiful, yet people are able to clearly distinguish between these two dimensions. Deadly venomous snakes representing a serious risk are perceived as highly fearful. This is especially true for the vipers and allies (pit vipers) possessing a characteristic body shape with a distinct triangular head and thick body, which was found as the most fear evoking by respondents from both countries. Although the attitude toward snakes is more negative among the respondents from Azerbaijan, their fear evaluation is similar to the Czechs. For instance, despite co-habitation with the Levant viper, it was not rated by the Azerbaijanis as more fearful than other dangerous snakes. In conclusion, agreement in the evaluation of snake fear and beauty is cross-culturally high and relative fear attributed to selected snake species is not directly explainable by the current environmental and cultural differences. This may provide some support for the evolutionary hypothesis of preparedness to fear snakes.","[Landova, Eva; Janovcova, Marketa; Peleskova, Sarka; Frynta, Daniel] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague, Czech Republic; [Landova, Eva; Janovcova, Marketa; Peleskova, Sarka; Polak, Jakub; Frynta, Daniel] Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Appl Neurosci & Brain Imaging, Klecany, Czech Republic; [Bakhshaliyeva, Natavan; Guliev, Akif] Baku State Univ, Biol Fac, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Suleymanova, Mesma] Nat Hist Museum, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Polak, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Arts, Dept Psychol, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Landova, E; Frynta, D (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague, Czech Republic.; Landova, E; Frynta, D (corresponding author), Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Appl Neurosci & Brain Imaging, Klecany, Czech Republic.",evalandova@seznam.cz; frynta@centrum.cz,"Pelkov, rka/W-5111-2017; Polk, Jakub/M-9927-2017; Frynta, Daniel/L-7350-2016","Pelkov, rka/0000-0001-9073-1613; Polk, Jakub/0000-0001-5005-3328; Frynta, Daniel/0000-0002-1375-7972; Janovcova, Marketa/0000-0001-7647-8148","GAUK [1310414, 346315]; GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-15991S]; Ministry of Education, Youth and SportsMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LO1611]","The financial support was given by GAUK n. 1310414 and n. 346315, GACR n. 17-15991S, personal costs of MJ were partly covered by project n.

We have described a paradigm for measuring fear-potentiated, whole-body acoustic startle in nonhuman primates and have developed a protocol for maintaining fear-potentiated startle over repeated sessions with minimal extinction to allow measurement of pharmacological effects on fear-potentiated startle by using within-subjects designs in relatively small groups of monkeys. Methods: A novel, within-subjects testing protocol was used to examine the effects of three compounds in rhesus monkeys that have anxiolytic effects in rodents on fear-potentiated startle but that differ in their mechanism of action. Spontaneous vocalizations during testing also were recorded. Juvenile monkeys that were trained to associate a visual stimulus with a fear-inducing air blast to the face were tested after acute administration of different doses of buspirone diazepam, morphine, or vehicle. Results: Monkeys rapidly developed a robust and persistent elevation of startle response in the presence of the CS during repeated testing sessions. Diazepam and morphine produced dose-related reductions of fear-potentiated startle. Buspirone did not significantly reduce fear-potentiated startle at the doses tested, although a trend was evident at the highest dose. All drugs reduced rates of coo vocalizations during startle testing. Conclusions: These fear-potentiated startle results suggest that rhesus monkeys have a pharmacological profile with respect to these compounds that is closer to humans than to rats. This demonstrates the value of examining the effects of drugs on fear-potentiated startle in nonhuman primates.","Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Winslow, JT (corresponding author), NIMH, IRP, NHP Core, NIHAC Bldg 110,9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",jameswinslow@mail.nih.gov,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH057704, R01MH047840, Z01MH002902, R37MH047840, P50MH058922] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH47840, MH58922, MH57704] Funding Source: Medline",,,47,38,38,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdl) plays a critical role in the regulation of fear and anxiety, and expresses high levels of OT receptor (OTR). However, the role of OTR neurotransmission within the BNSTdI in mediating these behaviors is unknown. Here, we used adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to investigate the role of OTR neurotransmission in the BNSTdI in the modulation of the acoustic startle response, as well as in the acquisition and consolidation of conditioned fear using fear potentiated startle (FPS) paradigm. Bilateral intra-BNSTdI administration of OT (100 ng) did not affect the acquisition of conditioned fear response. However, intra-BNSTdI administration of specific OTR antagonist (OTA), (d(CH2)(5)(1), Tyr(Me)(2), Thr(4), Orn(8), des-Gly-NH29)-vasotocin, (200 ng), prior to the fear conditioning session, impaired the acquisition of cued fear, without affecting a non-cued fear component of FPS. Neither OTA, nor OT affected baseline startle or shock reactivity during fear conditioning. Therefore, the observed impairment of cued fear after OTA infusion resulted from the specific effect on the formation of cued fear. In contrast to the acquisition, neither OTA nor OT affected the consolidation of FPS, when administered after the completion of fear conditioning session. Taken together, these results reveal the important role of OTR neurotransmission in the BNSTdI in the formation of conditioned fear to a discrete cue. This study also highlights the role of the BNSTdI in learning to discriminate between threatening and safe stimuli. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

During an observation phase, female volunteers watched a video showing models performing cold pressor tasks (CPT), of which the color served as a conditioned stimulus (CS). In a differential fear conditioning paradigm, each of 2 colors were either paired with models' painful (CS+) or neutral (CS) facial expressions. Exposure consisted of participants performing CPTs of both colors (10 C). Self-reported fear of pain and expected pain ratings were obtained after the observation period, while actual pain and avoidance measures were obtained during and after exposure. Results show that after observing another person performing the CPT associated with the painful faces, subjects report more fear of pain and expect more intense and unpleasant pain as compared with the CPT associated with the neutral faces. This effect of observational learning on pain-related fear persisted until after exposure. During and after exposure no stimulus-type effect for pain ratings was found. This study provides preliminary evidence for observational learning of pain-related fear in humans. Perspective: Fear of pain can be more disabling than pain itself, and is a risk factor for chronic pain. Knowledge about the acquisition of pain-related fear may help to develop novel pain management programs. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the effects of observational learning on pain-related fear. (C) 2011 by the American Pain Society","[Helsen, Kim; Vlaeyen, Johan W.

We determined how different delays of extinction training (ET) impact fear-conditioned behaviors, changes in sleep, and stress responses. Methods: EEG activity, movement, and body temperature in mice were monitored via telemetry. Following contextual fear conditioning (shock training [ST]), separate groups of mice were reexposed to the context at 24-hour post-ST (24h ET-1) and at 48-hour post-ST (48h ET-1). Post-ET sleep amount and sleep-associated EEG (delta and theta) activity were compared to baseline and to post-ST sleep. Freezing, locomotion, grooming, and rearing were monitored to determine effects of ET on fear behaviors. Body temperature immediately after ET was monitored to assess stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH). Results: 24h ET-1 and 48h ET-1 produced similar freezing and REM reductions, but dissimilar rearing activity and SIH. 24h ET-1 was followed by periods of suppressed REM-associated theta (REM-theta) activity, immediately after ET and during the subsequent dark period. Suppressed REM-theta was specific to sleep after 24h ET-1, and did not occur after ST, nor after 48h ET-1. Conclusions: ET-1 at 24 and 48 hours after ST was associated with similar freezing and REM amounts, but with differences in other overt behaviors, in REM-theta, and in SIH. Freezing was not predictive of changes in other fear-associated responses. This study demonstrated that consideration of time delay from fear acquisition to extinction is important when assessing the relationships between extinction and behavior, sleep, and stress responses.","[Machida, Mayumi; Sutton, Amy M.; Williams, Brook L.; Wellman, Laurie L.; Sanford, Larry D.] Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Dept Pathol & Anat, Sleep Res Lab, POB 1980, Norfolk, VA 23507 USA",,"Sanford, LD (corresponding author), Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Dept Pathol & Anat, Sleep Res Lab, POB 1980, Norfolk, VA 23507 USA.",SanforLD@evms.edu,,,National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH64827],This work was supported by National Institutes of Health research grant MH64827.,,47,3,3,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0161-8105,1550-9109,,SLEEP,Sleep,OCT,2019,42,10,,,,,,,zsz147,10.1093/sleep/zsz147,,,9,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,JI3RL,WOS:000493385300012,31322681,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2022-04-16,

The cognitive-behavioral fear-avoidance model of chronic pain suggests that pain-related fear contributes to the development and maintenance of pain-related disability. However, investigations of the relation between pain-related fear and disability have demonstrated considerable between-study variation. The main goal of the current meta-analysis was to synthesize findings of studies investigating cross-sectional associations between pain-related fear and disability in order to estimate the magnitude of this relation. We also tested potential moderators, including type of measure used, demographic characteristics, and relevant pain characteristics. Searches in PubMed and PsycINFO yielded a total of 46 independent samples (N = 9,579) that reported correlations between pain-related fear and disability among persons experiencing acute or chronic pain. Effect size estimates were generated using a random-effects model and artifact distribution method. The positive relation between pain-related fear and disability was observed to be moderate to large in magnitude, and stable across demographic and pain characteristics. Although some variability was observed across pain-related fear measures, results were largely consistent with the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain. Perspective: Results of this meta-analysis indicate a robust, positive association between pain-related fear and disability, which can be classified as moderate to large in magnitude. Consistent with the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain, these findings suggest that pain-related fear may be an important target for treatments intended to reduce pain-related disability.

In contrast, the neural basis of the unconditioned response and the mechanisms by which fear modulates inter-regional functional coupling have received limited attention. We examined the neural responses to an unconditioned stimulus using a partial-reinforcement fear conditioning paradigm and functional MRI. The analysis focused on: (1) the effects of an unconditioned stimulus (an electric shock) that was either expected and actually delivered, or expected but not delivered, and (2) on how related brain activity changed across conditioning trials, and (3) how shock expectation influenced interregional coupling within the fear network. We found that: (1) the delivery of the shock engaged the red nucleus, amygdale, dorsal striatum, insula, somatosensory and cingulate cortices, (2) when the shock was expected but not delivered, only the red nucleus, the anterior insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices showed activity increases that were sustained across trials, and (3) psycho-physiological interaction analysis demonstrated that fear led to increased red nucleus coupling to insula but decreased hippocampus coupling to the red nucleus, thalamus and cerebellum. The hippocampus and the anterior insula may serve as hubs facilitating the switch between engagement of a defensive immediate fear network and a resting network. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Data from 9033 elderly subjects aged >= 65 years were analyzed from the 2008 National Elderly Survey of the Korea Ministry of Health & Welfare. Results: In total, 76.6% of elderly Korean subjects had fear of falling. Factors associated with an increased risk of fear of falling in elderly subjects were, in order from highest to lowest, previous experience of falling (odds ratio [OR] = 6.41, p < 0.001), experience of body pain (OR = 2.45, p < 0.001), lower perceived health status (OR = 1.89, p < 0.001), presence of depression (OR = 1.82, p < 0.001), receipt of more doses of drugs per day for those receiving 1-2 (OR = 1.72, p < 0.001) or = 3 doses of drugs per day (OR = 1.67, p = 0.001), older age (OR = 1.68, p < 0.001), female gender (OR = 1.64, p < 0.001), dependence for instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 1.55, p < 0.001), dependence for activities of daily living (OR = 1.44, p = 0.017), and lower education level (OR = 1.18, p = 0.016). Conclusion: The fear of falling can be attenuated by providing interventions to reduce the impact of modifiable risk factors that were identified in this study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we aimed to transiently modulate and test the cortical excitability during fear processing using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and brain oscillations in theta and alpha frequency bands with electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: We conducted two separate experiments (no-TMS and TMS). In the no-TMS experiment, EEG recordings were performed during the instructed fear paradigm in which a visual cue (CS+) was paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (electric shock), while the other visual cue was unpaired (CS-). In the TMS experiment, in addition the TMS was applied on the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The participants also underwent structural MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning and were assigned pseudo-randomly to both experiments, such that age and gender were matched. The cortical excitability was evaluated by time-frequency analysis and functional connectivity with weighted phase lag index (WPLI). We further linked the excitability patterns with markers of stress coping capability. Results: After visual cue onset, we found increased theta power in the frontal lobe and decreased alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+ relative to CS- trials. TMS of dmPFC increased theta power in the frontal lobe and reduced alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+. The TMS pulse increased the information flow from the sensorimotor region to the prefrontal and occipital regions in the theta and alpha bands, respectively during CS+ compared to CS-. Pre-stimulation frontal theta power (0.75-1 s) predicted the magnitude of frontal theta power changes after stimulation (1-1.25 s). Finally, the increased frontal theta power during CS+ compared to CS- was positively correlated with stress coping behavior. Conclusion: Our results show that TMS over dmPFC transiently modulated the regional cortical excitability and the fronto-occipital information flows during fear processing, while the pre-stimulation frontal theta power determined the strength of achieved effects. The frontal theta power may serve as a biomarker for fear processing and stress-coping responses in individuals and could be clinically tested in mental disorders.","[Chirumamilla, Venkata C.; Gonzalez-Escamilla, Gabriel; Koirala, Nabin; Bonertz, Tamara; von Grotthus, Sarah; Muthuraman, Muthuraman; Groppa, Sergiu] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Sect Movement Disorders & Neurostimulat, Biomed Stat & Multimodal Signal Proc Unit, Dept Neurol,Focus Program Translat Neurosci,Univ, Mainz, Germany",,"Groppa, S (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Sect Movement Disorders & Neurostimulat, Biomed Stat & Multimodal Signal Proc Unit, Dept Neurol,Focus Program Translat Neurosci,Univ, Mainz, Germany.",segroppa@uni-mainz.de,"Koirala, Nabin/Y-3055-2019; Muthuraman, Muthuraman/ABD-2021-2020; Gonzalez-Escamilla, Gabriel/B-6961-2016; Groppa, Sergiu/A-5711-2019","Koirala, Nabin/0000-0002-8261-8271; Muthuraman, Muthuraman/0000-0001-6158-2663; Gonzalez-Escamilla, Gabriel/0000-0002-7209-1736; Groppa, Sergiu/0000-0002-2551-5655",German Research Council (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC-TR-1193],This work was supported by a grant from the German Research Council (DFG; CRC-TR-1193 project B05).,,43,1,1,1,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-453X,,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

We analyzed the neural mechanisms underlying context-dependent extinction and renewal in a clinically relevant model of conditioned abdominal pain-related fear.Experimental design: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, two groups of healthy volunteers underwent differential fear conditioning with painful rectal distensions as unconditioned stimuli (US) and visual conditioned stimuli (CS+; CS-). The extinction context was changed in an experimental group (context group), which was subsequently returned into the original learning context to test for renewal. No context changes occurred in the control group. Group differences in CS-induced differential neural activation were analyzed along with skin conductance responses (SCR), CS valence and CS-US contingency ratings.Principal observations: During extinction, group differences in differential neural activation were observed in dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventromedial (vmPFC) prefrontal cortex and amygdala, mainly driven by enhanced activation in response to the CS- in the control group. During renewal, observed group differences in activation of dlPFC and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) resulted primarily from differential modulation of the CS- in the absence of group differences in response to CS+ or SCR. ConclusionThe extinction context affects the neural processing of nonpain predictive safety cues, supporting a role of safety learning in pain-related memory processes.

Subjects (n = 13) were initially submitted to four habituation trials. followed by four random confrontation sessions for each test (DZP 0, 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg). Each trial was divided into three consecutive 5-min intervals: pre-exposure, exposure (human observer, taxidermized oncilla cat) and post-exposure. As DZP induced sedation, marmosets (n = 10) were re-tested in a second experiment, consisting of two habituation trials and four confrontation sessions per stimulus, with lower DZP doses (0, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg). Exposure to both stimuli significantly increased direct gazes and alarm calls, being dose-dependently reduced by DZP only in the PC test. In the HT protocol, the significant decrease in aerial scans was not detected with 0.10 mg/kg DZP. Locomotion, proximity, displacement activities and vigilance were not consistently influenced by the stimuli and/or DZP. The results thus suggest that the FIT test had a greater impact on the marmosets' behavior, while DZP was more effective on the reactions observed in the PC test, possibly due to the inherent nature of each stimulus, distinct threat levels and/or presentation order.

This pathway's existence is fundamental for understanding nonconscious emotional responses, but has been challenged as a result of a lack of evidence for short-latency fear-related responses in primate amygdala, including humans. We recorded human intracranial electrophysiological data and found fast amygdala responses, beginning 74-ms post-stimulus onset, to fearful, but not neutral or happy, facial expressions. These responses had considerably shorter latency than fear responses that we observed in visual cortex. Notably, fast amygdala responses were limited to low spatial frequency components of fearful faces, as predicted by magnocellular inputs to amygdala. Furthermore, fast amygdala responses were not evoked by photographs of arousing scenes, which is indicative of selective early reactivity to socially relevant visual information conveyed by fearful faces. These data therefore support the existence of a phylogenetically old subcortical pathway providing fast, but coarse, threat-related signals to human amygdala.","[Mendez-Bertolo, Constantino; Moratti, Stephan; Lopez-Sosa, Fernando; Strange, Bryan A.] Tech Univ Madrid, Ctr Biomed Technol, Lab Clin Neurosci, Madrid, Spain; [Mendez-Bertolo, Constantino] UCM UPM, CEI Campus Moncloa, Madrid, Spain; [Moratti, Stephan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Basic Psychol 1, Madrid, Spain; [Moratti, Stephan] Tech Univ Madrid, Lab Cognit & Computat Neurosci, Ctr Biomed Technol, Madrid, Spain; [Toledano, Rafael; Gil-Nagel, Antonio] Hosp Ruber Int, Dept Neurol, Epilepsy Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Martinez-Alvarez, Roberto] Hosp Ruber Int, Dept Neurosurg, Madrid, Spain; [Mah, Yee H.] St Georges Univ London, Neurosci Res Ctr, Cardiovasc & Cell Sci Inst, London, England; [Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Lab Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Neurosci & Neurol, Univ Hosp, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Geneva, Switzerland; [Strange, Bryan A.] Reina Sofia Ctr Alzheimers Res, Dept Neuroimaging, Madrid, Spain",,"Strange, BA (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Ctr Biomed Technol, Lab Clin Neurosci, Madrid, Spain.; Strange, BA (corresponding author), Reina Sofia Ctr Alzheimers Res, Dept Neuroimaging, Madrid, Spain.",bryan.strange@upm.es,"Vuilleumier, Patrik/AAJ-1839-2021; Mndez-Brtolo, Constantino/R-3803-2018; Strange, Bryan A/L-9466-2014; Moratti, Stephan/A-5605-2019; Lopez Sosa, Fernando/H-4961-2017; Strange, Bryan/AAF-3805-2019","Vuilleumier, Patrik/0000-0002-8198-9214; Strange, Bryan A/0000-0001-6476-4091; Moratti, Stephan/0000-0003-0824-8759; Lopez Sosa, Fernando/0000-0002-0601-9103; Strange, Bryan/0000-0001-6476-4091","Spanish Ministry of Science and EducationSpanish Government [SAF2011-27766]; Marie Curie Career Integration Fellowship [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG 304248]; PICATA fellowship of CEI Moncloa (UCM-UPM); Ramon y Cajal fellowshipSpanish Government [RYC-2009-04974]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Education, Marie Curie Career Integration Fellowship [SAF2011-27766, FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG 304248]; BIAL FoundationBial Foundation [119/12]","We thank the electroencephalography technicians at the Hospital Ruber Internacional.

Here we used inhibitory component of AP-1 transcription factor, JunB, in order to map brain regions where JunB-dependent transcription is regulated during consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory. We found that contextual fear memory consolidation induced JunB expression in the medial nucleus and intercalated cells of the amygdala while extinction training induced JunB in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the dorsal hippocampus. JunB upregulation induced by contextual fear memory extinction was absent in alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation-deficient mice which have impaired contextual fear memory extinction.

An exposure model was developed and used to assess the combined risks of oral and dermal exposure under a variety of exposure conditions. A total of 4500 API uptake values and 165 lifetime risk values were estimated for 15 and 11 APIs, respectively. Overall, the lifetime human health risks posed by the APIs and their mixtures based on modeling results were deemed acceptable under typical exposure conditions. Under very extreme environmental conditions and human behavior, API mixture risks were of potential concern while the risks of individual APIs were negligible, with a few exceptions.

However, most of the methodologies of risk assessment adopt the deterministic approach of using a fixed value for ascertaining the hazards derived from exposure to chemical pollutants. However, this is not the case of the Human, Ecological and Radiological Risk (HERisk) code, which allows space-time assessments of ecological, radiological, and human health risks. Indeed, this work aims to describe this new software (enhanced version of HHRISK), which not only improves the performance of the code but also increases its applicability and versatility. To showcase its usefulness in evaluating ecological pollution and human health risk were studied the contents of potentially toxic elements (Co, Cu. Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in soils and surface waters from the nickel mining area in the municipality of Itagiba (Bahia, Brazil). The obtained results showed that metals are nonhomogeneous distributed, suggesting the presence of local enrichment sources, mainly related to human activities. The statistical analyses carried out revealed that mining and agricultural activities are possibly responsible for the contents of these pollutants in both soils and surface waters. The calculated ecological indices of pollution confirmed anthropogenic pollution around the mining area, especially in the locations closest to sterile waste piles. The results of the human health risk assessment revealed that the ingestion of meat and contaminated water are the main routes for entering the potentially toxic elements to the human body and that Co is the chemical specie that poses the highest risk in the entire region. The hazard index (HI) values indicated that the whole area around the mine should be considered as a high risk for human health. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Objects from one category were reinforced by an electrical shock, whereas the other category was never reinforced. Results confirmed concept-based fear learning through subjective report of shock expectancy, heightened skin conductance responses, and enhanced 24 h recognition memory for items from the conditioned category.

Modulation of fear memories by noninvasive brain stimulation techniques might be an attractive approach, which, however, has not been examined so far. We investigated the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left supraorbital region on fear memories in humans. Seventy-four young, healthy individuals were assigned randomly to two groups, which underwent fear conditioning with mild electric stimuli paired with a visual stimulus. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were shown a reminder of the conditioned fearful stimulus. Shortly thereafter, they received either tDCS (right prefrontal - anodal, left supraorbital - cathodal) for 20 min at 1 mA current intensity or sham stimulation. A day later, fear responses of both groups were compared by monitoring skin conductance. On day 3, during fear response assessment, the tDCS group had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher mean skin conductance in comparison with the sham group. These results suggest that tDCS (right prefrontal - anodal, left supraorbital - cathodal) enhanced fear memories, possibly by influencing the prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit underlying the memory for fear.","[Mungee, Aditya; Kazzer, Philipp; Bajbouj, Malek] Charite, Dept Psychiat, D-14050 Berlin, Germany; [Mungee, Aditya; Kazzer, Philipp; Feeser, Melanie; Bajbouj, Malek] Free Univ Berlin, Cluster Excellence Languages Emot, Berlin, Germany; [Bajbouj, Malek] Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Inst Neuroimaging Emot, Berlin, Germany; [Nitsche, Michael A.] Univ Med, Dept Clin Neurophysiol, Gottingen, Germany; [Schiller, Daniela] Mt Sinai Hosp New York, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA",,"Mungee, A (corresponding author), Charite, Dept Psychiat, Campus Benjamin Franklin, D-14050 Berlin, Germany.",aditya.mungee@charite.de,"Bajbouj, Malek/ABD-6241-2021; Schiller, Daniela/Q-2431-2018; Nitsche, Michael A/B-6755-2012; Bajbouj, Malek/B-3579-2012","Bajbouj, Malek/0000-0002-0073-3322; Schiller, Daniela/0000-0002-0357-7724; ","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Charite Medical Neuroscience Program; cluster 'Languages of Emotion'; Cluster of Excellence 'Languages of Emotion' at the Free University, Berlin","The authors thank the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), Charite Medical Neuroscience Program and the cluster 'Languages of Emotion' for supporting this project.

To maintain emotional well-being, it is similarly important to be able to learn which stimuli predict safety. The ability to discriminate between stimuli that predict danger and safety has been suggested to not only have an emotional component, but also a cognitive one. One such candidate mechanism is mnemonic discrimination (MD), the ability to differentiate between two memories that are similar but not identical. In the present study, we wanted to examine if MD performance helps to explain inter-individual differences in the ability to acquire a differentiated fear response during fear conditioning. Methods: Participants performed a task assessing MD ability, and then underwent a fear conditioning procedure. Fear responses were measured using skin conductance responses (SCRs). Results: Results revealed no support for MD ability being associated with to which degree a differentiated fear response was acquired, or with the time needed to acquire such a response. Limitations: Our only outcome measurement was SCRs. Future studies need to include fear ratings, expectancy ratings and neural responses. Future studies also need to examine this using a stimulus material where the conditioned stimulus and the safety stimulus are more difficult to distinguish from each other. Conclusions: If MD ability has a role in inhibiting overgeneralization of fear learning, this does not seem to be driven by MD already during the initial learning.","[Davidson, Per; Johansson, Mikael] Lund Univ, Dept Psychol, Box 213, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Davidson, Per] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, CNY 149 13th St, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Davidson, Per] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, CNY 149 13th St, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Jonsson, Peter] Kristianstad Univ, Ctr Psychol, Sch Educ & Environm, Elmetorpsvagen 15, S-29888 Kristianstad, Sweden",,"Davidson, P (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Psychol, Box 213, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",per.davidson@psy.lu.se,"Davidson, Per/AFE-2915-2022; Jonsson, Peter/I-2059-2014","Davidson, Per/0000-0001-9943-9862; Jonsson, Peter/0000-0002-2921-3945",Helge Ax:son Johnson Foundation; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2017-06383],"This study was partially funded by a grant from the Helge Ax:son Johnson Foundation.

People can be exposed to PAHs through ingestion or dermal contact with contaminated sediments or through ingestion of finish and shellfish exposed to contaminated sediments. Although more than 100 PAHs have been identified, human exposure and risk are commonly evaluated for 18 individual PAHs. Other PAHs, such as alkylated PAHs, likely contribute to biological activity of environmental PAH mixtures; however, insufficient toxicity data are available to quantify their potential risk. This article presents an initial evaluation of the potential for human health risk from exposure to alkylated PAHs in sediment and fish. Individual alkylated PAHs have been observed to have potentially mutagenic, tumor-promoting, or carcinogenic activity. However, except for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, insufficient toxicity data are available to quantify toxicity or cancer risk from exposure to individual alkylated PAHs or mixtures of alkylated PAHs. This article describes a proposed strategy to better understand the potential human health risk from exposure to alkylated PAHs. Implementation of this strategy will contribute to evaluations of human exposure to complex PAH mixtures in the environment.","Menzie Cura & Associates, Winchester, Hants, England",,"Baird, SJS (corresponding author), Massachusetts Dept Environm Protect, 1 Winter St, Boston, MA 02108 USA.",sandra.baird@state.ma.us,,,,,,58,30,30,12,77,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Defensive aggression arising from fear may be implicated in some attacks and thus research on measuring fear in dogs is clearly required. The aim of the present study was to examine the validity of several measures of fear of novel and startling stimuli previously identified in the authors' laboratory. Anxiolytic drugs have been shown to reduce fear behaviour in rats in novel situations and thus an anxiolytic drug, clomipramine, was used in the present study to examine the validity of these previously identified measures of fear. Twenty-four dogs of varying breed, age and sex were used in a cross-over design, involving a placebo treatment and a clomipramine treatment. It was found that when the dogs were medicated with clomipramine for 6 weeks they were quicker to approach and spent more time near the stimulus (P < 0.05) in a novel object test. Furthermore, there was a tendency (P = 0.06) for a treatment by order interaction in which treatment with clomipramine in the first period but not the second period was associated with reduced latency to approach and increased time spent near the stimulus in the startling test. There was no treatment effect on latencies and entries to areas in a light/dark test and an elevated plus maze test. These results indicate that a number of behavioural variables in two of the tests, the novel object and startling test, are measures of fear of novel and startling stimuli, respectively, in dogs and furthermore provide a useful methodology to study fear-induced aggression in dogs.

And the management of fear memories is important when facing mental health disorders such as post-traumatic stress. Adolescence is a transitional stage of physical and psychological human development and the ability to deal with the fear memory in adolescence may be a potent factor for developing mental disorders in adulthood. However, little is known about the direct relationship between the ability to deal with the fear memory and appearance of depressive-like behaviors. To assess this, we used a model of associative learning to induce the fear memories and evaluated the depressive-related behaviors in the fear memory extinction process and its underlying cellular mechanisms from adolescent and adult mice. We found that, compared with adult mice, the adolescent mice exhibited impaired fear memory extinction in contextual fear conditioning extinction process. Meanwhile, impaired fear memory extinction was accompanied by more immobility time in forced swimming test, which was used to assess the depressive-like state. Consistent with this, we observed that long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in the hippocampal CA1 region of adolescent mice persistently larger in extinction process in adolescent mice, which was involved the presynaptic mechanism. Together, our results suggest that adolescent mice exhibited a disability to extinct the fear memory, and that this may lead to the depressive-like behaviors via presynaptic-mediated synaptic plasticity. These findings may give us a new insight in the knowledge of some mental disorders caused by persistent unpleasant memories.","[Lu, Kun; Jing, Xiao-Bo; Song, Xiang-Jian] Zhengzhou Orthopaed Hosp, Dept Pediat Orthopaed, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Xue, Qiong] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Anesthesiol, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wei, Mei-Dan] Southern Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 3, Dept Pharm, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ai-Guo] Zhengzhou Orthopaed Hosp, Dept Traumat Orthoped, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China",,"Wei, MD (corresponding author), Southern Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 3, Dept Pharm, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Wang, AG (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Orthopaed Hosp, Dept Traumat Orthoped, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China.",weimeidan0521@163.com; wag0726@163.com,,,Medical Science and Technology Research Foundation of Guangdong Province [A2016499]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2017A030313208],This study was supported by Medical Science and Technology Research Foundation of Guangdong Province (A2016499) and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2017A030313208).,,59,4,5,1,8,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0304-3940,1872-7972,,NEUROSCI LETT,Neurosci.

Previous research in humans demonstrates that prenatal or adolescent stress increases the risk for psychiatric disorders. Animal models investigating the effects of stress during prenatal or adolescent development produces behavioral outcomes analogous to those observed in humans. However, whether adolescent stress exposure potentiates the effects of prenatal stress is currently unknown. Thus, the current study tested whether adolescent stress increases the impact of prenatal stress on contextual and cued fear memory in adulthood. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to a chronic variable stress schedule during the last week of gestation, during adolescence, or during both developmental periods before undergoing fear conditioning training in adulthood. Our hypothesis predicted that the combined effects of prenatal and adolescent stress on contextual and cued fear memory would be greater than the effects of stress during either time period alone. In contrast to our hypothesis, however, we found independent effects of prenatal and adolescent stress on contextual and cued fear memory in both sexes, with no additional combined impact of stress exposure during both developmental phases. In males, developmental stress increased freezing behavior during contextual and cued testing regardless of whether stress exposure was prenatal, adolescent, or combined prenatal and adolescent stress exposure. In contrast, the effects of developmental stress in females were both test- and ovarian hormone status-dependent. During cued testing, nonstressed female freezing behavior depended on estrous cycle phase, whereas freezing behavior in stressed females did not, suggesting that developmental stress interferes with hormone-dependent cued fear memory. No effects of developmental stress or estrous cycle phase were observed for contextual fear memory in females. The results of the current study suggest that the effects of prenatal and adolescent stress on contextual and cued fear memory are not cumulative, but the effects of developmental stress on associative memory differ between males and females.","[Chavez, Marcia C.; Schulz, Kalynn M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Psychol, 1404 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37916 USA; [Ragusa, Maria; Brooks, Kayla; Drake-Frazier, Chakeer; Ramos, Isabella; Zajkowski, Megan] VA Eastern Colorado Hlth Care Syst, Aurora, CO USA",,"Chavez, MC (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Psychol, 1404 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37916 USA.",mchavez4@vols.utk.edu,"Schulz, Kalynn/O-6740-2018","Schulz, Kalynn/0000-0001-5001-3721",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH113115]; United States Department of Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [1 IK2 BX001562-01],This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [MH113115]; and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs [1 IK2 BX001562-01].,,70,0,0,2,5,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0031-9384,1873-507X,,PHYSIOL BEHAV,Physiol.

This is partially due to the lack of suitable methods for interlinking usability engineering and human-centered risk management. Especially regarding the early identification of human-induced errors and the systematic control of these failures, medical device manufacturers and in particular the developers have to be supported in order to guarantee reliable design and error-tolerant human-machine interfaces (HMI). In this context, we developed the HiFEM methodology and a corresponding software tool (mAIXuse) for model-based human risk analysis. Based on a two-fold approach, HiFEM provides a task-type-sensitive modeling structure with integrated temporal relations in order to represent and analyze the use process in a detailed way. The approach can be used from early developmental stages up to the validation process. Results of a comparative study with the HiFEM method and a classical process-failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) depict, that the new modeling and analysis technique clearly outperforms the FMEA. Besides, we implemented a new method for systematic human risk control (mAIXcontrol). Accessing information from the method's knowledge base enables the operator to detect the most suitable countermeasures for a respective risk. Forty-one approved generic countermeasure principles have been indexed as a resulting combination of root causes and failures in a matrix. The methodology has been tested in comparison to a conventional approach as well. Evaluation of the matrix and the reassessment of the risk priority numbers by a blind expert demonstrate a substantial benefit of the new mAIXcontrol method.","[Janss, Armin; Plogmann, Simon; Radermacher, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Helmholtz Inst BME, Chair Med Engn, Aachen, Germany",,"Janss, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Helmholtz Inst BME, Chair Med Engn, Aachen, Germany.",janss@hia.rwth-aachen.de,"Radermacher, Klaus/V-5850-2017","Radermacher, Klaus/0000-0003-4395-3197",Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) in the framework of the AIF/FQS project InnoRisk; Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) in the framework of the AIF/FQS project SysRisk,This work has been funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) in the framework of the AIF/FQS projects InnoRisk and SysRisk.,,42,4,4,1,27,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,1862-278X,,BIOMED ENG-BIOMED TE,Biomed.

Thus, identification of a novel means to enhance fear extinction to stand the passage of time and generalize across contexts is of the utmost importance. Acute bouts of exercise can be used as inexpensive, noninvasive treatment strategies to reduce anxiety, and have been shown to enhance memory for extinction when performed in close temporal proximity to the extinction session. However, it is unclear whether acute exercise can be used to prevent relapse of fear, and the neural mechanisms underlying this potential effect are unknown. The current study therefore examined whether acute exercise during extinction of auditory fear can protect against the later relapse of fear. Male F344 rats lacking an extended history of wheel running were conditioned to fear a tone CS and subsequently extinguished within either a freely mobile running wheel, a locked wheel, or a control context lacking a wheel. Rats exposed to fear extinction within a freely mobile wheel ran during fear extinction, and demonstrated reduced fear as well as attenuated corticosterone levels during re-exposure to the extinguished CS during the relapse test in a novel context 1 week later. Examination of cfos mRNA patterns elicited by re-exposure to the extinguished CS during the relapse test revealed that acute exercise during extinction decreased activation of brain circuits classically involved in driving fear expression and interestingly, increased activity within neurons of the direct striatal pathway involved in reward signaling. These data suggest that exercise during extinction reduces relapse through a mechanism involving the direct pathway of the striatum. It is suggested that a positive affective state could become associated with the CS during exercise during extinction, thus resulting in a relapse-resistant extinction memory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The n-ary sumation 8DL-PCB concentrations were ranged from 0.29 to 1.35 ng g(-1) l.w., (mean 6.2 +/- 8.7 ng g(-1) l.w.), with toxicity equivalent to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) ranging from 8.58 x 10(-6) to 0.05 ng TEQ g(-1) l.w. The spatial trend of PCB levels in human milk revealed higher bioaccumulative levels for urban mothers as compared with rural counterparts. The estimated daily intake (EDI) values of DL-PCBs to infants through trans-mammary transfer were considerably higher than tolerable daily intake limits established by WHO (i.e., 1-4 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw) and other globally recognized organizations. Similarly, the hazard quotient values for TEQ n-ary sumation 8DL-PCBs (range 1.21 to 79.87) were far above the benchmark value of 1 at all the sampling sites, indicating the high levels of adverse health risks to infants in the region through breast milk consumption. The n-ary sumation 34PCB levels were found to be negatively correlated with mother' age (r = -0.31; p = 0.02), parity (r = - 0.85; p = 0.001), and infant' birth weight (r = - 0.73; p = 0.01).

The present study was outlined to investigate if the association between coffee odor (CS1) and electrical footshock (US) would be an effective model for the study of fear-induced behavior and whether compounds used in humans for emotional-related disorders such as midazolam, propranolol, or scopolamine, applied during the different stages of fear conditioning (acquisition, consolidation and expression), affect the defensive responses to both, the olfactory CS1, and the context (CS2) where the CS1 had been presented (second order conditioning). The results revealed that five pairings between coffee odor (CS1) and electrical footshock (US) were able to elicit consistent defensive responses and a second order conditioning to the context (CS2). Midazolam (0.375-0.5 mg/kg; i.p.) treatment was able to interfere with the CS1-US association and with the consolidation of the aversive information. The propranolol (5-10 mg/kg; i.p.) treatment interfered with the CS1-US association, with the retention of fear memory and with the CS1-CS2 association. Propranolol also attenuated the expression of conditioned fear responses when applied before the CS1 test session. Scopolamine (0.6-1.2 mg/kg; i.p.) treatment impaired the acquisition of CS1-US and CS1-CS2 associations, and also disrupted the expression of conditioned fear responses when injected prior to the CS1 test session. These findings have pointed out the usefulness for the olfactory fear conditioning paradigm to investigate drug effects on the acquisition, consolidation and expression of fear conditioned responses.

Previous studies showed that apelin may be required for certain forms of learning and memory. Up to date, the role of apelin in fear memory has not been explored. In the present study, we tested the effects of apelin-13 (1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 A mu g/rat) on contextual fear conditioning (experiment 1), consolidation (experiment 2) and expression (experiment 3) in rats. A well established fear conditioning protocol was used, which contained three training phases: habituation, fear conditioning and test. Apelin-13 was i.c.v injected 10 min before conditioning (experiment 1), immediately after conditioning (experiment 2) or 10 min before testing (experiment 3). The values of percent freezing were used to measure fear. We found that only 2.0 A mu g apelin-13 administrations produced a decrease freezing in experiment 1. The most effective dose of apelin-13 (2.0 A mu g) was selected, but it had no effect on freezing in experiment 2 and 3. Furthermore, the decreased freezing in experiment 1 was not attributed to the deficits of locomotor activity and foot-shock sensitivity. These results, for the first time, indicated that apelin-13 impaired fear acquisition but not fear consolidation or expression.","[Han, Li; Luo, Huaiqing; Qin, Xiaoqun] Cent S Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Changsha 410007, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Huaiqing] Changsha Med Univ, Dept Anat Histol & Embryol, Changsha 410219, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Fulian] Cent S Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Changsha 410013, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Tian, Shaowen] Cent S Univ, Dept Physiol, Coll Med, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, Peoples R China",,"Qin, XQ (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Physiol, Changsha 410007, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Tian, SW (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Dept Physiol, Coll Med, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, Peoples R China.",tsw1997@126.com; shishikong_1998@163.com,,,,,,35,9,12,0,7,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-3190,1573-6903,,NEUROCHEM RES,Neurochem.

Samples were analyzed for metals (e.g., cadmium, nickel) and chlorinated pesticides (e.g., PCNB, DDT, and metabolites). Flame and furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry were utilized for analysis of metals, while gas chromatography (GC) and CC-mass spectrophotometry were utilized for analysis of chlorinated pesticides. Because no formalized guidelines exist to determine risk of botanical dietary supplements, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for protection of human health were used. Metals and chlorinated organics were found in Ginseng samples, but the concentrations posed no noncarcinogenic hazard; however, a 1000 mg/d dose for 350 d/yr resulted in 1 x 10(-6) carcinogenic risk in 19% of the Ginseng samples analyzed.

We have suggested that the fear-inhibited light reflex paradigm could be used as a laboratory model of human anxiety. In the present study, we examined whether two doses (5 mg and 10 mg) of the anxiolytic drug diazepam would antagonize the effects of threat on the pupillary light reflex. Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in three weekly sessions, each associated with one of three treatments (diazepam 5 mg or 10 mg or placebo) in a double-blind, balanced, crossover design. The light reflex was recorded during either the anticipation of a shock (threat blocks) or periods in which no shocks were anticipated (safe blocks). At the end of each threat or safe block, subjects rated their anxiety using visual analogue scales. Two-factor ANOVA (treatment x condition) showed that diazepam treatment antagonized the effect of threat on light reflex amplitude in a dose-dependent manner but it did not affect the threat-induced increase in pupil diameter. Diazepam had no effect on the pupillary light reflex in the safe condition. Diazepam also reduced subjective anxiety and alertness in the threat condition. These results show the sensitivity of the threat-induced reduction of light reflex amplitude to anxiolytic drugs, and provide further evidence for the utility of the fear-inhibited light reflex paradigm as a laboratory model of human anxiety.","Queens Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",,"Szabadi, E (corresponding author), Queens Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Floor A,South Block, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England.",,,,,,,26,25,25,0,7,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JAN,1998,135,1,,,,,93,98,,10.1007/s002130050489,,,6,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,YT081,WOS:000071562100011,9489938,,,,2022-04-16,

This diversity of the human experience, combined with the manner in which it may (or may not) present, creates several challenges for risk assessors if they are to give available HD due weight in the RA process. An evaluation was made of how HD has been cited and used within the 64 human health RAs published by the EU to the end of 2005. In all RAs, HD had been cited to some degree. But there was no consistency between how cited data had subsequently been taken forward and used in the evaluation of different endpoints, either between the RAs authored by the same or different EU Member States. The lack of any accepted guidance for addressing the role that HD can play within the RA process appears to lead to this situation. Recommendations are provided on the scope and focus such guidance could usefully be expected to take.","Esso Belgium, Occupat Hlth, Machelen, Belgium",,"Money, CD (corresponding author), Esso Belgium, Occupat Hlth, Machelen, Belgium.",chris.money@exxonmobil.com,,,,,,14,2,2,0,3,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-4332,,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,APR,2007,27,2,,,,,387,396,,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2007.00891.x,,,10,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",169XO,WOS:000246625600010,17511705,,,,2022-04-16,

Patients were recruited from sexually transmitted infection and HIV clinics in Athens. Samples were obtained from oral, penile, and anal sites of 294 study participants and HPV testing was performed on 882 samples using next-generation sequencing. Patients also completed a questionnaire assessing risk factors for infection. The mean age of the participants was 33.1, 30% identified as men who have sex with men (MSM), and 21% were HIV positive. The prevalence of HPV was 49%; it was the highest at anal sites (33%) compared with 23% at penile sites (P=0.008) and 4% at oral sites (P<0.001). The most common HPV types in order of frequency were 6, 44, 16, 53, and 89. The genotype concordance rate was the highest between the penile and anal sites (7%), followed by 2% for anal-oral concordance. Identifying as MSM [adjusted odds ratios (aOR)=6.75, P<0.001] and being HIV positive (aOR=2.89, P=0.026) were significant risk factors for anal HPV infection, whereas alcohol use (aOR=0.45, P=0.002) was associated negatively with infection. The only significant risk factor for oral infection was an older age of sexual debut (aOR=1.32, P=0.038). Nearly half of our study participants tested positive in at least one of three anatomical sites. Using next-generation sequencing, we could identify high-risk types that are not covered by the current vaccine and would be missed by traditional HPV testing kits.","[Tsikis, Savas; Hoefer, Lea] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sharma, Shruti; Long, Bradley C.; Mujacic, Ibro; Kadri, Sabah; Segal, Jeremy P.; Furtado, Larissa V.; Charnot-Katsikas, Angella] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL USA; [Schneider, John] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Med, Chicago, IL USA; [Schneider, John] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Bethimoutis, George; Nicolaidou, Electra; Paparizos, Vassilios; Antoniou, Christina] Univ Athens, Dept Dermatol & Venerol, Andreas Syggros Hosp, Athens, Greece; [Chardalias, Leonidas; Stavropoulos, Georgios-Emmanouil] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Athens, Greece",,"Charnot-Katsikas, A (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC 0006, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",angella.charnot-katsikas@uchospitals.edu,"Nicolaidou, Electra/AAD-7039-2019","Kadri, Sabah/0000-0003-0365-6550; Nicolaidou, Electra/0000-0002-8221-0217","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R21 AI118998, R01 DA033875]; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1 TR000430]; University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine Summer Research Project fund; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000430] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R21AI118998] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA033875] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (R21 AI118998, R01 DA033875), the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (UL1 TR000430), and the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine Summer Research Project fund.",,27,7,7,2,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0959-8278,1473-5709,,EUR J CANCER PREV,Eur.

For irrational fears and their associated phobias, epidemiological studies suggest sex differences in prevalence and twin studies report significant genetic effects. How does sex impact on the familial transmission of liability to fears and phobias? Methods. In personal interviews with over 3000 complete pairs (of whom 1058 were opposite-sex dizygotic pairs), ascertained from a population-based registry, we assessed the lifetime prevalence of five phobias and their associated irrational fears analysed using a multiple threshold model. Twin resemblance was assessed by polychoric correlations and biometrical model-fitting incorporating sex-specific effects. Results. For agoraphobia, situational and blood/injury fear/phobia, the best fit model suggested equal heritability in males and females and genetic correlations between the sexes of less than +0(.)50. For animal fear/phobias by contrast, the best fit model suggested equal heritability in males and females and a genetic correlation of unity. No evidence was found for an impact of family environment on liability to these fears or phobias. For social phobias, twin resemblance in males was explained by genetic factors and in females by familial-environmental factors. Conclusion. The impact of sex on genetic risk may differ meaningfully across phobia subtypes. Sex-specific genetic risk factors may exist for agoraphobia, social, situational and blood-injury phobias but not for animal fear/phobia. These results should be interpreted in the context of the limited power of twin studies, even with large sample sizes, to resolve sex-specific genetic effects.","Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Coll Med, Dept Human Genet, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; Virginia Inst Psychiat & Behav Genet, Richmond, VA USA",,"Kendler, KS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, POB 980126, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.",,"Jacobson, Kristen C/D-2064-2009; Kendler, Kenneth/AAF-2876-2019",,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH040828, R01MH049492] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA009095] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [AA-09095] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH-49492, MH-40828] Funding Source: Medline",,,42,41,42,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0033-2917,1469-8978,,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

To this end, qualitative research was carried out through in-depth interviews and discussion groups with 73 boys and girls between the ages of 16 and 22. The article asserts that there are gender differences in the spaces of fear. Girls are the ones who experience fear the most when they walk alone, and at specific times - a feeling that is made worse in specific public spaces. The study results show that girls' fear is associated with sexual assault and boys' fear with robberies or fights. Results show that three main types of strategies are used in the face of these fears: avoidance, confronting risks and empowerment. All these strategies include the use of new communication technologies. This article seeks to provide a theoretical contribution to enhancing a gender perspective in the field of urban geography.","[Garcia-Carpintero, Maria Angeles; de Diego-Cordero, Rocio; Tarrino-Concejero, Lorena] Univ Seville, Dept Nursing, Sch Nursing Physiotherapy & Podiatry, C Avenzoar 6, Seville 41009, Spain; [Pavon-Benitez, Laura] Univ Granada, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, Granada, Spain",,"de Diego-Cordero, R (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Nursing, Sch Nursing Physiotherapy & Podiatry, C Avenzoar 6, Seville 41009, Spain.",rdediego2@us.es,"Tarrio-Concejero, Lorena/AAE-6469-2019; Pavn Bentez, Laura/AAY-5700-2021; de Diego-Cordero, Roco/ABC-4164-2020","Tarrio-Concejero, Lorena/0000-0003-0158-5744; Pavn Bentez, Laura/0000-0001-9786-3555; de Diego-Cordero, Roco/0000-0002-3453-003X","Ministry of Industry, Economy and Competitiveness, State Research Agency, State Plan for Scientific Research and Innovation Technique (MINECO/FEDER, EU) [FEM2016-77116-C2-1-R]","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Ministry of Industry, Economy and Competitiveness, State Research Agency, State Plan for Scientific Research and Innovation Technique, 2016-2019 (Reference FEM2016-77116-C2-1-R, MINECO/FEDER, EU).",,56,1,1,9,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5068,1461-7420,,EUR J WOMENS STUD,Eur.

The present study examined whether acute citalopram increased fear-potentiated startle to predictable and/or unpredictable shocks in healthy subjects. Eighteen healthy subjects each received two treatments, placebo and 20 mg citalopram in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second in which unpredictable shocks were anticipated, and a third in which no shocks were administered. Changes in aversive states were investigated using acoustic startle stimuli. Citalopram did not affect baseline startle. However, the phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was robustly increased by acute citalopram. The sustained startle potentiation in the unpredictable conditions was also increased by citalopram, but only when the drug was given during the first session. These results indicate that a single dose of citalopram is not anxiogenic in itself, but can exacerbate the expression of fear and anxiety.","NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, 15K N Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 113,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,"Levenson, Jessica C/O-5448-2015; Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019",,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798, Z01MH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA Funding Source: Medline",,,38,114,115,0,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0893-133X,,,NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOL,Neuropsychopharmacology,JAN,2007,32,1,,,,,225,231,,10.1038/sj.npp.1301204,,,7,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,117UT,WOS:000242899500022,16971899,Bronze,,,2022-04-16,

Materials and methods Cross-sectional and cohort studies published from 2000 to 2014, that measured DFA in children /adolescents (aged 0-19 years), in the general population, or visiting private or public dental services (general or pediatric) or attending school and kindergarten, were searched, with specific terms, in 3 electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web Of Science). Primary data, collected with specific questionnaires of demonstrated reliability and/or validity, were extracted. Results After screening 743 abstracts and evaluating 164 full-text publications, 36 articles were selected. Dental fear/anxiety prevalence rates were 12.2%, 10.0%, 12.2%, 11.0% and 20.0% for the CFSS-DS, DAS, MDAS, DFS, and DFSS-SF scores, respectively. In the studies that used MCDAS Dental fear/prevalence rates varied from 13.3% to 29.3%. In the studies that used CFSS-DS ratings, the prevalence and the mean score of dental fear/anxiety was lower in Northern Europe than the remaining countries, the prevalence decreased with increasing age and the frequency was higher in females than males. Conclusions Dental fear/anxiety is a common problem in children/adolescents worldwide, therefore, new strategies to overcome this relevant children/adolescent condition should be encouraged.","[Cianetti, S.; Lombardo, G.; Pagano, S.] Univ Perugia, Unit Paediat Dent, Biomed Sci, Perugia, Italy; [Abraha, I.; Montedori, A.] Hlth Planning Serv Perugia, Reg Hlth Author Umbria, Perugia, Italy; [Caruso, S.; Gatto, R.] Univ Aquila, Sch Dent, Dept Life Hlth & Environm Sci, Laquila, Italy; [De Giorgio, S.; Salvato, R.] Univ Perugia, Dept Philosophy Social & Human Sci & Educ, Perugia, Italy; [Paglia, L.] Ist Stomatol Italiano Isi, Dept Paediat Dent, Milan, Italy",,"Lombardo, G (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Unit Paediat Dent, Biomed Sci, Perugia, Italy.",guido.lombardo@unipg.it,"Abraha, Iosief/K-4327-2018","Abraha, Iosief/0000-0002-5440-775X; MONTEDORI, ALESSANDRO/0000-0001-7719-573X; LOMBARDO, Guido/0000-0002-4502-6103",,,,70,67,71,2,22,ARIESDUE SRL,CARIMATE,"VIA AIROLDI, CARIMATE, 11-22060, ITALY",1591-996X,2035-648X,,EUR J PAEDIATR DENT,Eur.

Adults (N = 39) and adolescents (N = 44) completed differential fear acquisition wherein each conditional stimulus (CS) appeared in a background context. In the dangerous context, one stimulus (CS+) predicted an aversive sound, and the other stimulus (CS-) did not. In the safe context, the aversive sound was never administered with either CS. During fear generalization, participants were presented with three generalization stimuli (GSs), ranging on a perceptual continuum from threat to safety stimuli, in both contexts. Participants then completed avoidance conditioning and avoidance generalization phases, allowing them to actively avoid the upcoming aversive sound by pressing an avoidance button. Developmental differences emerged in threat perception, physiological arousal, avoidance behavior, and eye movements during contextual fear learning and generalization. Adolescents showed less discrimination between stimuli and contexts than adults, resulting primarily from their elevated fear responses to safety and generalized stimuli. Developmental differences in fear learning should be further explored in future research, as they could explain why adolescence is a sensitive developmental period for anxiety.","[Klein, Zohar; Berger, Smadar; Shechner, Tomer] Univ Haifa, Sch Psychol Sci, Haifa, Israel; [Klein, Zohar; Berger, Smadar; Shechner, Tomer] Univ Haifa, Integrated Brain & Behav Res Ctr, Haifa, Israel; [Vervliet, Bram] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Biol Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Vervliet, Bram] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Brain Inst, Leuven, Belgium",,"Shechner, T (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Sch Psychol Sci, Haifa, Israel.; Shechner, T (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Integrated Brain & Behav Res Ctr, Haifa, Israel.",tshechner@psy.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,60,0,0,4,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

Different tactics such as ambush, stalking, and pursuit may lead to spatially heterogeneous distributions of predation risk. Studying how such a landscape of risk looks in a multi-predator setting has become topical in light of the re-colonization of apex predators in areas with extensive human harvesting. The human hunter is likely to adapt hunting tactics to increase encounter rate and hunting success, but is also limited by time constraints, light conditions, legislation, tradition, and/or skills. The extent to which hunters vary tactics resulting in a spatial pattern of risk to ungulate prey has never been quantified. By comparing habitat characteristics between kill sites and sites used by GPS-marked roe deer, we quantified the landscape of risk as experienced by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) exposed to predation by both Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and humans using different hunting tactics in southeastern Norway. Lynx killed roe deer in denser habitat than roe deer used on average, while humans killed most roe deer in open terrain. However, humans used multiple hunting tactics, and habitat characteristics varied predictably between drive hunts conducted with rifle versus shotgun, and between stalking versus sit and wait hunts with a rifle. Vegetation density was higher where roe deer were shot during drive hunts with a shotgun and during stalking than when shot during drive hunting with a rifle or during sit and wait hunts. Shooting distance was shortest for drive hunts with a shotgun, similar for drive hunts with a rifle and stalking, and considerably longer during sit and wait hunting. Managers therefore have the possibility to create different risk landscapes by restricting types of weapons and types of hunting tactic allowed, also in combination with the duration of the hunting season.","[Norum, Jorgen Kvernhaugen; Mysterud, Atle] Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway; [Lone, Karen; Loe, Leif Egil] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway; [Linnell, John D.

Extinction and discrimination of fear memory have become therapeutic targets for PTSD. Newly developed optogenetics and advanced in vivo imaging techniques have provided unprecedented spatiotemporal tools to characterize the activity, connectivity, and functionality of specific cell types in complicated neuronal circuits. The use of such tools has offered mechanistic insights into the exquisite organization of the circuitry underlying the extinction and discrimination of fear memory. This review focuses on the acquisition of more detailed, comprehensive, and integrated neural circuits to understand how the brain regulates the extinction and discrimination of fear memory. A future challenge is to translate these researches into effective therapeutic treatment for PTSD from the perspective of precise regulation of the neural circuits associated with the extinction and discrimination of fear memories.","[Yan, Yan; Aierken, Ailikemu; Wang, Chunjian; Jin, Wei; Quan, Zhenzhen; Qing, Hong; Ni, Junjun] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Mol Med & Biotherapy, 5 Bldg,Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhe] Capital Med Univ, Adv Innovat Ctr Human Brain Protect, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhe] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Natl Clin Res Ctr Geriatr Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Juan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 5 South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Juan] Aerosp Ctr Hosp, Aerosp Med Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Ni, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Mol Med & Biotherapy, 5 Bldg,Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.; Zhao, J (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 5 South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",nijunjun@bit.edu.cn; 7520190072@bit.edu.cn,,"Ni, Junjun/0000-0001-8486-8146; Zhao, Juan/0000-0002-9709-751X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [92049102]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1312302-3],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 92049102) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC1312302-3).",,170,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1073-8584,1089-4098,,NEUROSCIENTIST,Neuroscientist,,,,,,,,,,,1.07386E+16,10.1177/10738584211069977,,JAN 2022,20,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,YP9JU,WOS:000748935900001,35057666,,,,2022-04-16,

However, fear extinction is often incomplete in these patients. Our previous study had shown that Rac1 activity in hippocampus plays a crucial role in the learning of contextual fear memory in rats. Here, we further investigated whether Rac1 activity also modulated the extinction of contextual fear memory. We found that massed extinction obviously upregulated hippocampal Rac1 activity and induced long-term extinction of contextual fear in rats. Intrahippocampal injection of the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 prevents extinction of contextual fear in massed extinction training rats. In contrast, long-spaced extinction downregulated Rac1 activity and caused less extinction. And Rac1 activator CN04-A promotes extinction of contextual fear in long-spaced extinction rats. Our study demonstrates that inhibition of Rac1 activity in the hippocampus impaired extinction of contextual fear, suggesting that modulating Rac1 activity of the hippocampus may be promising therapy of fear disorders.

The mechanisms by which corticosteroids exert their effects on behavior are often indirect, because, although corticosteroids do not regulate behavior, they induce chemical changes in particular sets of neurons making certain behavioral outcomes more likely in certain contexts as a result of the strengthening or weakening of particular neural pathways. The timing of corticosteroid increase (before, during or after exposure to a stressor) determines whether and how behavior is affected. The present review shows that different aspects of fear and anxiety are affected differentially by the occupation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at different phases of the stress response. Corticosteroids, at low circulating levels, exert a permissive action via brain MRs on the mediation of acute freezing behavior and acute fear-related plus-maze behavior. Corticosteroids, at high circulating levels, enhance acquisition, conditioning and consolidation of an inescapable stressful experience via GR-mechanisms. Brain GR-occupation also promotes processes underlying fear potentiation. Fear potentiation can be seen as an adjustment in anticipation of changing demands. However, such feed-forward regulation may be particularly vulnerable to dysfunction. MR and/or GR mechansisms are involved in fear extinction. Brain MRs may be involved in the extinction of passive avoidance, and GRs may be involved in mediating the extinction of active avoidance. In the developing brain, corticosteroids play a facilitatory role in the ontogeny of freezing behavior, probably via GRs in the dorsal hippocampus, and their influence on the development of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system. Corticosteroids can exert maladaptive rather than adaptive effects when their actions via MRs and GRs are chronically unbalanced due to chronic stress. Both mental health of humans and animal welfare is likely to be seriously threatened after psychosocial stress, prolonged stress, prenatal stress or postnatal stress, especially when maternal care or social support is absent, because these can chronically dysregulate the central MR/GR balance. In such circumstances the normally adaptive corticosteroid responses can become maladaptive. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this test, mice are placed into a conditioning chamber and are given parings of a conditioned stimulus (an auditory cue) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (an electric footshock). After a delay time, the mice are exposed to the same conditioning chamber and a differently shaped chamber with presentation of the auditory cue. Freezing behavior during the test is measured as an index of fear memory. To analyze the behavior automatically, we have developed a video analyzing system using the ImageFZ application software program, which is available as a free download at http://www.mouse-phenotype.org/. Here, to show the details of our protocol, we demonstrate our procedure for the contextual and cued fear conditioning test in C57BL/6J mice using the ImageFZ system. In addition, we validated our protocol and the video analyzing system performance by comparing freezing time measured by the ImageFZ system or a photobeam-based computer measurement system with that scored by a human observer. As shown in our representative results, the data obtained by ImageFZ were similar to those analyzed by a human observer, indicating that the behavioral analysis using the ImageFZ system is highly reliable.

Rat studies have shown increases and decreases in these behaviors. Inconsistencies may be due to differences in testing conditions and the extent to which each test measures anxiety, fear, or activity. Few mouse studies have been performed. The present study was conducted to address these issues by examining the effect of estradiol benzoate (EB) in ovariectomized (OVX), C57BL/6 mice on a range of behavioral paradigms measuring anxiety [open field (OF), dark-light transition (DLT), elevated plus maze (EP)], activity [running wheel (RW)], and conditioned fear learning (FCon). In OF, vehicle (Veh) animals spent more time in the center than EB-treated animals and were more active overall. In DLT, Veh animals were more active than EB-treated animals in both the dark and light compartments and made more transitions between the two. In EP, Veh animals entered a greater number of arms. During FCon, EB animals froze more than Veh to the conditioned stimulus. In contrast, in the home cage RW, EB animals were more active than Veh. Factor analysis was used to characterize intertask correlations of females' behavior and to explore the possibility that estrogen may have an impact on a general arousal factor. In sum, estrogen treatment heightened fear responses in a range of fear and anxiety-provoking situations (OF, DLT, EP, and FCon), while increasing activity in the safer RW. We suggest that EB treatment may result in a generally more aroused animal.

Cerebral abnormalities at term age have been clearly linked with later behavior alterations, but existing studies did not focus on the amygdala. Moreover, studies of early amygdala development after premature birth in humans are scarce. Objective: To compare amygdala volumes in very preterm infants at term equivalent age (TEA) and term born infants, and to relate premature infants amygdala volumes with their performance on the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (Lab-TAB) fear episode at 12 months. Participants: Eighty one infants born between 2008 and 2014 at the University Hospitals of Geneva and Lausanne, taking part in longitudinal and functional imaging studies, who had undergone a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at TEA enabling manual amygdala delineation. Outcomes: Amygdala volumes assessed by manual segmentation of MRI scans; volumes of cortical and subcortical gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) automatically segmented in 66 infants; scores for the Lab-TAB fear episode for 42 premature infants at 12 months. Results: Amygdala volumes were smaller in preterm infants at TEA than term infants (mean difference 138.03 mm(3), p < 0.001), and overall right amygdala volumes were larger than left amygdala volumes (mean difference 36.88 mm(3), p < 0.001). White matter volumes were significantly smaller (p < 0.001) and CSF volumes significantly larger (p, 0.001) in preterm than in term born infants, while cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes were not significantly different between groups. Amygdala volumes showed significant correlation with the intensity of the escape response to a fearsome toy (r(s) = 0.38, p = 0.013), and were larger in infants showing an escape response compared to the infants showing no escape response (mean difference 120.97 mm(3), p = 0.005). Amygdala volumes were not significantly correlated with the intensity of facial fear, distress vocalizations, bodily fear and positive motor activity in the fear episode. Conclusion: Our results indicate that premature birth is associated with a reduction in amygdala volumes and white matter volumes at TEA, suggesting that altered amygdala development might be linked to alterations in white matter connectivity reported in premature infants.

Fifty-three women participated in the study. Each subject underwent four experimental conditions (control, fear, relaxation, and a combined fear-relaxation condition), lasting 10 min each. Fear was provoked by an unpredictable aversive human scream. Relaxation should be induced with the aid of verbal instructions. To control for respiratory effects on HPV, breathing was paced at 0.2 Hz using an indirect light source. Besides physiological measures (HPV measures, EGG, respiration, forearm EMG, blood pressure), emotional states (pleasure, arousal, dominance, state anxiety) were assessed by subjects' self-reports. Since relaxation instructions did not have any effect neither on the subjective nor on the physiological variables, the present paper focuses on the comparison of the control and the fear condition. The scream reliably induced changes in both physiological and self-report measures. During the fear condition, subjects reported mon arousal and state anxiety as well as less pleasure and dominance. Heart period decreased, while EMG and diastolic blood pressure showed a tendency to increase. HPV remained largely unaltered with the exception of the LF component, which slightly decreased under fear induction. Replicating previous findings, trait anxiety was negatively associated with HPV, but there were no treatment-specific differences between subjects with low and high trait anxiety.","Univ Giessen, Dept Clin & Physiol Psychol, Giessen, Germany; Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Expt & Physiol Psychol, Greifswald, Germany",,"Stark, R (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Clin & Physiol Psychol, Giessen, Germany.",Rudolf.Stark@Psychol.Uni-Giessen.de,"Walter, Bertram/AAD-4695-2021","Schienle, Anne/0000-0003-2173-6626",,,,39,3,3,0,4,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"MERKELSTR 3, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",0269-8803,2151-2124,,J PSYCHOPHYSIOL,J.

The surface water data was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). ADEs for human health were set for each pharmaceutical in the study. The pharmaceuticals were evaluated for known adverse health interactions and their potential health impact. These factors were brought together using a cumulative hazard index (HI) risk assessment calculation to assess the overall risk of pharmaceuticals in NJ surface water to human health. When examining the potential for DDI in this assessment, the risk increased but not appreciably. The HI for the sample locations ranged from <0.00001 to 0.01 with the DDI adding less than 1.2x increase to the overall risk. The calculated risk of these mixtures was also increased to an extreme DDI of 7times per interaction.

Cyanobacteria occurr especially in eutrophic inland and coastal surface waters, where under favorable conditions they attain high densities and may form blooms and scums. Cyanotoxins can be grouped according to their biological effects into hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, and toxins with irritating potential, also acting on the gastrointestinal system. The chemical and toxicological properties of the main cyanotoxins, relevant for the evaluation of possible risks for human health, are presented. Humans may be exposed to cyanotoxins via several routes, with the oral one being by far the most important, occurring by ingesting contaminated drinking water, food, some dietary supplements, or water during recreational activities. Acute and short-term toxic effects have been associated in humans with exposure to high levels of cyanotoxins in drinking and bathing waters. However, the chronic exposure to low cyanotoxin levels remains a critical issue. This article identifies the actual risky exposure scenarios, provides toxicologically derived reference values, and discusses open issues and research needs.","[Funari, Enzo; Testai, Emanuela] Ist Super Sanita, Environm & Primary Prevent Dept, I-00161 Rome, Italy",,"Funari, E (corresponding author), Ist Super Sanita, Environm & Primary Prevent Dept, Viale Regina Elena 299, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",enzo.funari@iss.it; emanuela.testai@iss.it,"Testai, Emanuela/K-5121-2016","Testai, Emanuela/0000-0003-3113-5103",,,,226,289,300,11,182,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1040-8444,1547-6898,,CRIT REV TOXICOL,Crit.

Recently, in addition to direct effects, it has been shown that indirect (non-lethal) effects of predation risk are predominant in many populations. Predation risk is often structured in space and time, generating a heterogeneous landscape of fear within which animals can minimize risks by modifying their habitat use. Furthermore, for ungulates, resource quality seems to be positively correlated with human-related sources of risk. We studied the trade-off between access to resources of high-quality and risk-taking by contrasting habitat use of roe deer during daytime with that during nighttime for 94 roe deer in a hunted population. Our first hypothesis was that roe deer should avoid human disturbance by modifying their habitat use during daytime compared to nighttime. Our results supported this, as roe deer mainly used open fields during nighttime, but used more forested habitats during daytime, when human disturbance is higher. Moreover, we found that diel patterns in habitat use were influenced by hunting disturbance. Indeed, the roe deer decreased their use of high-crops during daytime, an important source of cover and food, during the hunting season. The proximity of roads and dwellings also affected habitat use, since roe deer used open fields during daytime to a greater extent when the distance to these sources of disturbance was higher. Hence, our results suggest that roe deer resolve the trade-off between the acquisition of high-quality resources and risk avoidance by modifying their habitat use between day and night.","[Bonnot, Nadege; Morellet, Nicolas; Verheyden, Helene; Cargnelutti, Bruno; Lourtet, Bruno; Hewison, A.

Credit scoring has been so successful that it has expanded beyond lending and into our everyday lives, even to inform how insurers evaluate our health. The pervasive application of credit scoring has outpaced knowledge about why credit scores are such useful indicators of individual behavior. Here we test if the same factors that lead to poor credit scores also lead to poor health. Following the Dunedin (New Zealand) Longitudinal Study cohort of 1,037 study members, we examined the association between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk and the underlying factors that account for this association. We find that credit scores are negatively correlated with cardiovascular disease risk. Variation in household income was not sufficient to account for this association. Rather, individual differences in human capital factors-educational attainment, cognitive ability, and self-control-predicted both credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk and accounted for similar to 45% of the correlation between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk. Tracing human capital factors back to their childhood antecedents revealed that the characteristic attitudes, behaviors, and competencies children develop in their first decade of life account for a significant portion (similar to 22%) of the link between credit scores and cardiovascular disease risk at midlife. We discuss the implications of these findings for policy debates about data privacy, financial literacy, and early childhood interventions.","[Israel, Salomon; Caspi, Avshalom; Harrington, HonaLee; Houts, Renate; Moffitt, Terrie E.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Caspi, Avshalom; Moffitt, Terrie E.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Caspi, Avshalom; Moffitt, Terrie E.] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Social Genet & Dev Psychiat Ctr, London SE5 8AF, England; [Belsky, Daniel W.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Study Aging & Human Dev, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Belsky, Daniel W.] Duke Univ, Social Sci Res Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Hogan, Sean; Ramrakha, Sandhya; Poulton, Richie] Univ Otago, Dunedin Sch Med, Dunedin Multidisciplinary Hlth & Dev Res Unit, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Sanders, Seth] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Sanders, Seth] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Moffitt, TE (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",terrie.moffitt@duke.edu,"Moffitt, Terrie E/D-5295-2011; Belsky, Daniel/AAB-4785-2021; Houts, Renate/AAC-5304-2019; caspi, avshalom/AAJ-5874-2020","Moffitt, Terrie E/0000-0002-8589-6760; Belsky, Daniel/0000-0001-5463-2212; Houts, Renate/0000-0002-1518-2631; caspi, avshalom/0000-0003-0082-4600; Israel, Salomon/0000-0003-3629-2466","New Zealand Health Research CouncilHealth Research Council of New Zealand; National Institute on Aging (NIA) Grant [AG032282]; UK Medical Research Council GrantUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K00381X]; Yad Hanadiv Rothschild Foundation; NIAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [T32-AG000029, P30 AG028716-08]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G0100527, G9806489, G0601483, MR/K00381X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [G0100527, MR/K00381X/1, G0601483, G9806489] Funding Source: UKRI; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P30AG028716, R01AG032282, T32AG000029] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the Dunedin Study members, their peer informants, the Unit research staff, and Study founder Phil Silva.

In this series emphasis is placed on the risk of infectious disease. Our 21stst century understanding of human biology is that, as holobionts, we possess a majority of microbial cells and genes. In fact, our microbes fundamentally affect our interactions with the external environment, metabolism, physiology, and risk of both pathology and disease. As holobionts, we require our microbial partners for us to be both complete and healthy. Using the 20th century understanding of human biology, we failed to capture the effects of the microbiome in evaluating health risks. But 21st century risk assessments such as those associated with exposure to specific microbial pathogens need to include the human microbiome.

Learned signals for safety inhibit fear, and so when presented, reduce fear responses produced by danger signals. This phenomenon is termed conditioned inhibition of fear. Here, we report that CS+/CS fear discrimination conditioning over 5 days in rats leads the CS to become a conditioned inhibitor of fear, as measured by the classic tests of conditioned inhibition: summation and retardation of subsequent fear acquisition. We then show that NMDA-receptor antagonist AP5 injected to posterior insular cortex (IC) before training completely prevented the acquisition of a conditioned fear inhibitor, while intra-AP5 to anterior and medial IC had no effect. To determine if the IC contributes to the recall of learned fear inhibition, injections of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol were made to posterior IC before a summation test. This resulted in fear inhibition per se, which obscured inference to the effect of IC inactivation with recall of the safety cue. Control experiments sought to determine if the role of the IC in conditioned inhibition learning could be reduced to simpler fear discrimination function, but fear discrimination and recall were unaffected by AP5 or muscimol, respectively, in the posterior IC. These data implicate a role of posterior IC in the learning of conditioned fear inhibitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The processing of other fear-relevant cues, such as facial expressions, has also been associated with amygdala function, but an effect of serotonin depletion on these processes has not been assessed. Objective: The present study investigated the effects of reducing serotonin function, using acute tryptophan depletion, on the recognition of basic facial expressions of emotions in healthy male and female volunteers. Methods: A double-blind between-groups design was used, with volunteers being randomly allocated to receive an amino acid drink specifically lacking tryptophan or a control mixture containing a balanced mixture of these amino acids. Participants were given a facial expression recognition task 5 h after drink administration. This task featured examples of six basic emotions (fear, anger, disgust, surprise, sadness and happiness) that had been morphed between each full emotion and neutral in 10% steps. As a control, volunteers were given a famous face classification task matched in terms of response selection and difficulty level. Results: Tryptophan depletion significantly impaired the recognition of fearful facial expressions in female, but not male, volunteers. This was specific since recognition of other basic emotions was comparable in the two groups. There was also no effect of tryptophan depletion on the classification of famous faces or on subjective state ratings of mood or anxiety. Conclusions: These results confirm a role for serotonin in the processing of fear related cues, and in line with previous findings also suggest greater effects of tryptophan depletion in female volunteers. Although acute tryptophan depletion does not typically affect mood in healthy subjects, the present results suggest that subtle changes in the processing of emotional material may occur with this manipulation of serotonin function.","Univ Oxford, Warneford Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England",,"Harmer, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Warneford Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England.",,"Rogers, Robert/AAF-7621-2019","Rogers, Robert/0000-0001-5010-069X; Tunbridge, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2966-2281; Cowen, Philip/0000-0001-5518-6138; Harmer, Catherine/0000-0002-1609-8335",,,,32,135,136,0,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JUN,2003,167,4,,,,,411,417,,10.1007/s00213-003-1401-6,,,7,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,696MC,WOS:000183889800010,12677354,,,,2022-04-16,

Healthy participants without history of back pain completed standardized reaches to high and low targets at self-paced and rapid speeds before and after induction of acute low back pain using a DOMS paradigm. Pain-related fear was assessed prior to DOMS induction. Three-dimensional joint motions of the thoracic spine, lumbar spine, and hip were recorded using an electromagnetic tracking device. DOMS-induced differences between high-and low-fear participants were observed for lumbar spine flexion, but not for thoracic or hip flexion. Pain-related fear scores were not predictive of lumbar flexion during baseline, but predicted reduced lumbar flexion during self-and fast-paced trials to low target locations once DOMS was induced. Pain-related fear was likewise predictive of perceived interference in life activities following DOMS induction. The findings suggest that initially pain-free individuals with high pain-related fear adopt avoidant spinal strategies during common reaching movements shortly after injury is sustained, which may comprise a risk factor for future pain and disability.

Therefore, fear generalization is considered a key mechanism for the development of anxiety disorders. However, systematic investigations on the variance in fear generalization are lacking. Therefore, the current study aims at identifying distinctive phenotypes of fear generalization among healthy participants. To this end, 1175 participants completed a differential fear conditioning phase followed by a generalization test. To identify patterns of fear generalization, we used a k-means clustering algorithm based on individual arousal generalization gradients. Subsequently, we examined the reliability and validity of the clusters and phenotypical differences between subgroups on the basis of psychometric data and markers of fear expression. Cluster analysis reliably revealed five clusters that systematically differed in mean responses, differentiation between conditioned threat and safety, and linearity of the generalization gradients, though mean response levels accounted for most variance. Remarkably, the patterns of mean responses were already evident during fear acquisition and corresponded most closely to psychometric measures of anxiety traits. The identified clusters reliably described subgroups of healthy individuals with distinct response characteristics in a fear generalization test. Following a dimensional view of psychopathology, these clusters likely delineate risk factors for anxiety disorders. As crucial group characteristics were already evident during fear acquisition, our results emphasize the importance of average fear responses and differentiation between conditioned threat and safety as risk factors for anxiety disorders.","[Stegmann, Y.; Gamer, M.; Pauli, P.] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Stegmann, Y.; Reif, A.; Domschke, K.; Gamer, M.; Pauli, P.] Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Mental Hlth, Wurzburg, Germany; [Schiele, M.

However, non-human animal data has shown that amygdala dependent threat (fear) learning can also lead to long lasting changes in cortical sensitivity, persisting even after extinction of fear responses. The neural mechanisms of long-lasting traces of such conditioning in humans have not yet been explored. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and assessed skin conductance responses (SCR) during threat acquisition, extinction learning and extinction retrieval. We provide evidence of lasting cortical plasticity in the human brain following threat extinction and show that enhanced blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal to the learned threat stimulus in the auditory association cortex is resistant to extinction. These findings point to a parallel avenue by which cortical processing of potentially dangerous stimuli can be long lasting, even when immediate threat and the associated amygdala modulation have subsided.

One type of inhibitory conditioning is extinction, a process in which stimuli that elicit fear by virtue of previous associations with aversive stimuli such as shock (excitatory fear conditioning) are now presented in the absence of the aversive stimuli (extinction training). As a result, the ability of the conditioned stimulus to elicit fear gradually diminishes. Extinction is different from forgetting and does not reflect an erasure of the original fear memory. Instead, extinction is an active form of inhibitory learning that competes with excitatory fear conditioning. Infusions into the amygdala (a brain area essential for excitatory fear conditioning) of either NMDA receptor antagonists or inhibitors of the NMDA-receptor-linked mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade block extinction learning. Conversely, the NMDA receptor agonist D-cycloserine facilitates extinction after either systemic administration or intra-amygdala infusion. Because therapeutic interventions based on extinction procedures are commonly used to treat fear disorders, and because D-cycloserine is a widely available and safe compound, D-cycloserine or similar agents might be usefully combined with traditional extinction-based approaches in the treatment of clinical fear.","Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Davis, M (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1639 Pierce St,Suite 4000, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,"anand, amit/A-7222-2009",,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 59906, MH 58922, MH 57250, MH 52384, MH 47840] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH059906, R01MH057250, R37MH047840, P50MH058922, P50MH052384, R01MH047840] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,51,119,129,0,10,NEW YORK ACAD SCIENCES,NEW YORK,"2 EAST 63RD ST, NEW YORK, NY 10021 USA",0077-8923,,1-57331-404-8,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2003,985,,,,,,218,232,,,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychiatry,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,BW71H,WOS:000182918800018,12724161,,,,2022-04-16,

Although much research has centered upon the idea that individuals can adaptively modify their behaviors to cope with environmental changes, recent evidence supports the existence of individual differences in suites of correlated behaviors. However, little is known about how selection can change these behavioral structures in populations subject to different environmental constraints. The colonization of urban environments by birds has been related to their inter-individual variability in their fear of humans, measured as their flight initiation distance to an approaching human, such that urban life would select for fearless individuals. This behavior has been demonstrated to be heritable and highly consistent throughout the adult lifespan of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). Here, we experimentally assessed, in field conditions, whether urban life involves changes in other behaviors such as exploration and antipredatory response through their correlation with fear of humans. Breeding urban birds were more fearless toward humans and were quicker to explore a new food resource and defend their nests from predators than their rural counterparts. However, while fear of humans positively correlated with exploration and antipredatory response in the rural population, it only correlated with exploration in the urban one. Predator release in urban environments could relax- and even counterselect-antipredator behaviors, thus dismantling the behavioral correlation existent in natural populations. Altogether, our results suggest that rural and urban animals may differ in some behavioral aspects, may be as a consequence of the selection processes acting during the colonization of urban areas as well as the different ecological environments encountered by individuals.","[Carrete, Martina] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Seville, Spain; [Carrete, Martina; Tella, Jose L.] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estac Biol Donana, Seville, Spain",,"Carrete, M (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Seville, Spain.; Carrete, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estac Biol Donana, Seville, Spain.",mcarrete@upo.es,"Carrete, Martina/D-2618-2017; Carrete, Martina/A-6376-2009","Carrete, Martina/0000-0002-0491-2950","Canal Sur TV; MINECO (Spain) [RYC-2009-04860, CGL2012-31888, CGL2015-71378-P]; Fundacion Repsol","M.

Overall, the references to human mobility within the SFDRR show an evolution in the way the issue is considered within global policy dialogues. Both the potential of population movements to produce risk and their role in strengthening the resilience of people and communities are now clearly recognized. This is an evolution of previously prevailing views of mobility as the consequence of disasters or as a driver of risk.

We have previously developed an observational fear learning (OFL) behavioral assay to measure empathic fear in mice. In the OFL task, a mouse is conditioned for context-dependent fear when it observes a conspecific demonstrator receiving aversive stimuli. In the present study, by comparing 11 different inbred mouse strains that are commonly used in the laboratory, we found that empathic fear response was highly variable between different strains. Five strains-C57BL/6J, C57BL/6NTac, 129S1/SvImJ, 129S4/SvJae and BTBRT+ Itpr3(tf)/J-showed observational fear (OF) responses, whereas AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ and NOD/ShiLtJ mice exhibited low empathic fear response. Importantly, day 2 OF memory was significantly correlated with contextual memory in the classical fear conditioning among the 11 strains. Innate differences in anxiety, locomotor activity, sociability and preference for social novelty were not significantly correlated with OFL. Interestingly, early adolescent C57BL/6J mice exhibited an increase in acquisition of OF. The level of OFL in C57BL/6J strain was not affected by sex or strains of the demonstrator. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that there are naturally occurring OFL-specific genetic variations modulating empathic fear behaviors in mice. The identification of causal genes may uncover novel genetic pathways and underlying neural mechanisms that modulate empathic fear and, ultimately, provide new targets for therapeutic intervention in human mental disorders associated with impaired empathy.","[Keum, S.; Park, J.; Kim, A.; Kim, K.

However, when the tested compounds also influence baseline startle, it is unclear how comparisons with control groups can best be made. Objective: To evaluate the validity of absolute difference (startle amplitude on CS minus non-CS test trials) vs. proportional increase (the absolute difference score divided by startle amplitude on non-CS test trials) scoring methods. Methods: The effect on proportional increase and absolute difference scores of baseline shifts that occur with or without concomitant increases in fear was evaluated in rats. A reliable measure should yield similar scores across shifting baselines, provided that fear levels remain constant. Results: Preexisting baseline differences, and those brought about by different startle-eliciting noise burst intensities, by strychnine injections, or by CRH infusions, each increased absolute difference scores without markedly influencing proportional change scores. These baseline differences were not associated with different fear levels. Increases in baseline startle brought about by unsignaled footshocks or by a second CS increases which are associated with increased fear partially occluded additional CS-induced increases using either measure. Conclusions: Across different baselines, CS-elicited fear is most accurately reflected in proportional change scores. Under certain conditions saturation effects may interfere with an accurate assessment using either measure. However, these same saturation effects may provide opportunities to explore the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety in novel ways.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Walker, DL (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1639 Pierce Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",dlwalke@emory.edu,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH047840, P50MH058922, R01MH059906, P50MH052384, R01MH057250, R37MH047840] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 52384, MH 57250, MH 58922, MH 47840, MH 59906] Funding Source: Medline",,,41,89,90,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,NOV,2002,164,3,,,,,318,328,,10.1007/s00213-002-1213-0,,,11,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,624UD,WOS:000179779200010,12424556,,,,2022-04-16,

Relationships with flight speed and fear of humans",APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Beef cattle; Temperament; Handling; Fear; Welfare,AVERSION LEARNING TECHNIQUES; DAIRY-COWS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MILK-YIELD; HEART-RATE; PEOPLE; BEHAVIOR; SITUATIONS; CALVES; DISCRIMINATION,"Numerous tests have been used to measure beef cattle temperament, but limited research has addressed the relationship between such tests and whether temperament can be modified. One-hundred-and-forty-four steers were given one of three human handling and yarding experiences on six occasions during a 12-month grazing period post-weaning (backgrounding): Good handling/yarding, Poor handling/yarding and Minimal handling/yarding. At the end of this phase the cattle were lot-fed for 78 days, with no handling/yarding treatments imposed, before being transported for commercial slaughter. Temperament was assessed at the start of the experiment, during backgrounding and lot-feeding by flight speed (FS) and a fear of humans test, which measured the proximity to a stimulus person (zone average; ZA), the closest approach to the person (CA) and the amount the cattle moved around the test arena (total transitions; TT). During backgrounding, FS decreased for all treatments and at the end of backgrounding there was no difference between them. The rate of decline, however, was greatest in the Good group, smallest in the Minimal group with the Poor intermediate. In contrast, ZA was affected by treatment, with a greater reduction for the Good group than the others (P = 0.012). During lot-feeding, treatment did not affect FS, but all groups showed a decrease in ZA, with the greatest change in the Poor group, the least in the Good and the Minimal intermediate (P = 0.052). CA was positively correlated with ZA (r = 0.18 to 0.66) and negatively with TT (r = -0.180 to -0.659). FS was consistently correlated with TT only (r = 0.17 to 0.49). These findings suggest that FS and TT measure a similar characteristic, as do ZA and CA, but that these characteristics are different from one another, indicating that temperament is not a unitary trait, but has different facets. FS and TT measure one facet that we suggest is general agitation, whilst ZA and CA measure fear of people. Thus, the cattle became less agitated during backgrounding, but the effect was not permanently influenced by the quantity and quality of handling/yarding. However, Good handling/yarding reduced fearfulness of people. Fear of people was also reduced during lot-feeding, probably as a consequence of frequent exposure to humans in a situation that was neutral or positive for the cattle.

Exposure therapy is the gold-standard treatment for PTSD, and fear extinction learning is a key concept underlying successful exposure. Methods This study examined the role of genetic endocannabinoid polymorphisms in a fear extinction paradigm with PTSD compared to healthy participants (N = 220). Participants provided saliva for genotyping, completed a fear conditioning and extinction task, with blood samples taken before and after the task (n = 57). Skin conductance was the outcome and was analyzed using mixed models. Results Results for cannabinoid receptor type 1 polymorphisms suggested that minor alleles of rs2180619 and rs1049353 were associated with poorer extinction learning in PTSD participants. The minor allele of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) polymorphism rs324420 was associated with worse extinction in PTSD participants. Subanalysis of healthy participants (n = 57) showed the FAAH rs324420 genotype effect was dependent on plasma arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) level, but not oleoylethanolamide or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. Specifically, higher but not lower AEA levels in conjunction with the minor allele of FAAH rs324420 were associated with better extinction learning. Conclusions These findings provide translational evidence that cannabinoid receptor 1 and AEA are involved in extinction learning in humans. FAAH rs324420's effect on fear extinction is moderated by AEA plasma level in healthy controls. These findings imply that FAAH inhibitors may be effective for targeting anxiety in PTSD, but this effect needs to be explored further in clinical populations.","[Ney, Luke J.; Matthews, Allison; Hsu, Chia-Ming Ken; Bruno, Raimondo] Univ Tasmania, Sch Psychol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Zuj, Daniel, V] Swansea Univ, Dept Psychol, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Nicholson, Emma; Steward, Trevor; Felmingham, Kim] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Nichols, David] Univ Tasmania, Cent Sci Lab, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Graham, Bronwyn] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Harrison, Ben] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne Neuropsychiat Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Harrison, Ben] Melbourne Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Ney, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Med Psychol, Private Bag 30, Sandy Bay, Tas 7005, Australia.",luke.ney@utas.edu.au,,"Nichols, David/0000-0002-8066-3132; Graham, Bronwyn/0000-0001-6582-2273; Ney, Luke/0000-0003-0209-8366",National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia [APP1073041],"National Health and Medical Research Council, Grant/Award Number: APP1073041",,87,5,5,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1091-4269,1520-6394,,DEPRESS ANXIETY,Depress.

Manipulations that enhance the extinction process can be beneficial for treatment. Animal studies have shown that fasting or caloric restriction can enhance extinction and inhibit the return of fear. The present study examined the effects of fasting on fear acquisition, extinction, and the return of fear in humans. One hundred and twenty-five male participants were randomized into a fasting group and food group and exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm. Changes in plasma cortisol and ghrelin levels were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. One-night fasting had no effect on fear acquisition but enhanced fear extinction retention and prevented the return of fear, and this effect persisted for at least 6 months. This procedure was also effective for remote fear memory. Plasma ghrelin levels were elevated after fasting and had a negative relationship with the fear response in spontaneous recovery test. However, overnight fasting did not affect cortisol levels. These findings indicate that fasting enhances extinction retention and prevents the return of fear, without influencing fear memory formation. We propose that this novel procedure may open new avenues for promoting extinction-based therapies for fear-related disorders.","[Shi, Le] Peking Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Hlth Sci Ctr, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Shi, Le; Han, Ying; Shi, Jie; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Shi, Le; Han, Ying; Shi, Jie; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Shi, Le; Deng, Jiahui; Chen, Sijing; Que, Jianyu; Wang, Zhong; Guo, Xiaojie; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Inst Mental Hlth, Key Lab Mental Hlth, Minist Hlth,Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders,Ho, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yekun; Zhang, Xiujun] North China Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Psychol, Tangshan 063009, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhong] Anhui Med Univ, Dept Med Psychol, Hefei 230032, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuxin] Allegheny Coll, Dept Neurosci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Xie, Wen] Mental Hlth Ctr Anhui Prov, Hefei 230032, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",,"Shi, J; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Shi, J; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Mental Hlth, Key Lab Mental Hlth, Minist Hlth,Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders,Ho, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",shjie@bjmu.edu.cn; linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB856400, 2015CB553503]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31230033, 91432303, 81521063, 8160050380]","This work was supported in part by the National Basic Research Program of China (no. 2015CB856400 and 2015CB553503) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31230033, 91432303, 81521063, and 8160050380).",,63,13,14,1,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",2158-3188,,,TRANSL PSYCHIAT,Transl.

The MAC-RF is an eight-item, self-report scale that has been developed to assess clinically relevant domains of fear during the COVID-19 pandemic. The MAC-RF is based on a comprehensive theoretical model conceptualizing fears during the pandemics as resulting from an interaction of bodily, interpersonal, cognitive, and behavioral experiences. The MAC-RF was administered to a sample of 623 Italian adults from the community aged between 18 and 76 years old (M= 35.67, SD= 12.93), along with a measure of current clinical symptoms. Item response theory analyses demonstrated that each item of the MAC-RF provided sufficient information about the underlying construct of fear. The statistical fit of the scale was satisfactory. MAC-RF total scores correlated significantly and positively with total scores on the measure of psychopathology and with the clinical symptom domain scores. A ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis showed that the MAC-RF total score was sufficiently able to identify cases with high levels of current psychopathology, with an area under the curve of.76. These findings suggest that the MAC-RF can be used to assess pathological fear during pandemics.

Previous studies indicate that PTSS are associated with low cortisol activity, and cortisol is shown to facilitate fear extinction. Few studies have examined the influence of cortisol reactivity on fear extinction in PTSS. Method: We used a standardized fear conditioning and extinction paradigm to investigate the relationship between fear extinction and endogenous salivary cortisol activity in participants with high PTSS (n = 18), trauma-exposed controls (n=33), and non-trauma-exposed controls (n=27). Skin conductance response (SCR) was used as an index of conditioned responding. Saliva samples were collected at baseline, and 20 min post-fear acquisition for basal and reactive cortisol levels, respectively. Results: PTSS participants demonstrated a slower rate of extinction learning during the early extinction phase. A moderation analysis revealed that cortisol reactivity was a significant moderator between fear inhibition to the safety signal (CS) during early extinction and PTSS, but not to the threat signal (CS+). Specifically, this interaction was significant in two ways: (1) participants with elevated cortisol reactivity showed lower PTSS as fear inhibition improved; and (2) participants with low cortisol reactivity showed higher PTSS as fear inhibition improved. Conclusion: The findings of the present study show that the relationship between fear inhibition and cortisol reactivity is complex, and suggest that cortisol reactivity shapes safety signal learning in PTSS.

In this paper, we describe a methodology for evaluating, classifying and integrating human and animal data into the risk assessment process that incorporates: (1) a balanced appraisal of human and animal data, (2) relevance to different stages of the risk assessment process, and (3) accommodation for different data quality requirements. The proposed framework offers a flexible, step-wise approach for determining which set of available data best support the chemical risk assessment that involves the rating and relative ranking of human and animal data quality. The evaluation of human data incorporates seven data quality elements, nature and specificity of the lead effect; evaluation of animal data incorporates data quality and relevance to humans. Results of simulations with selected chemicals previously evaluated in a formal risk assessment generally agreed with existing regulatory guidance. Application of the proposed framework across a wider range of chemical agents will improve transparency of the risk assessment process and validity of results, while informing continuous refinements to this evolving methodology.

This suggests that acute insomnia might act prophylactically against the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) even though it is also a possible risk factor for PTSD. We examined total sleep deprivation and memory suppression to evaluate the effects of these interventions on subsequent aversive memory formation and fear conditioning. Active suppression of aversive memory impaired retention of event memory. However, although the remembered fear was more reduced in sleep-deprived than sleep-control subjects, suppressed fear increased, and seemed to abandon the sleep-dependent plasticity of fear. Active memory suppression, which provides a psychological model for Freud's ego defense mechanism, enhances fear and casts doubt on the potential of acute insomnia as a prophylactic measure against PTSD. Our findings bring into question the role of sleep in aversive-memory consolidation in clinical PTSD pathophysiology.","[Kuriyama, Kenichi; Honma, Motoyasu; Yoshiike, Takuya; Kim, Yoshiharu] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Adult Mental Hlth, Tokyo, Japan",,"Kuriyama, K (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Adult Mental Hlth, Tokyo, Japan.",kenicik@ncnp.go.jp,"Honma, Motoyasu/M-7124-2018; Yoshiike, Takuya/AAL-5150-2020","Honma, Motoyasu/0000-0003-4612-0115; Yoshiike, Takuya/0000-0002-6071-8167","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Ministry of Education, Sports, Science, and Culture of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [25670122]; Japan Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental HealthJapan Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental Health; Takeda Science FoundationTakeda Science Foundation (TSF); SENSHIN Medical Research FoundationSENSHIN Medical Research Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25670122] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Sayori Koyama and Mikiko Kimura for technical assistance in the experimental trial.

Here, we characterize and reconcile the paradoxical role of ghrelin in the acquisition of fearful memories. METHODS: We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure endogenous acyl-ghrelin and corticosterone at time points surrounding auditory fear learning. We used pharmacological (systemic and intra-amygdala) manipulations of ghrelin signaling and examined several aversive and appetitive behaviors. We also used biotin-labeled ghrelin to visualize ghrelin binding sites in coronal brain sections of amygdala. All work was performed in rats. RESULTS: In unstressed rodents, endogenous peripheral acyl-ghrelin robustly inhibits fear memory consolidation through actions in the amygdala and accounts for virtually all interindividual variability in long-term fear memory strength. Higher levels of endogenous ghrelin after fear learning were associated with weaker long-term fear memories, and pharmacological agonism of the ghrelin receptor during the memory consolidation period reduced fear memory strength. These fear-inhibitory effects cannot be explained by changes in appetitive behavior. In contrast, we show that chronic stress, which increases both circulating endogenous acyl-ghrelin and fear memory formation, promotes profound loss of ghrelin binding sites in the amygdala and behavioral insensitivity to ghrelin receptor agonism. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide a new link between stress, a novel type of metabolic resistance, and vulnerability to excessive fear memory formation and reveal that ghrelin can regulate negative emotionality in unstressed animals without altering appetite.","[Harmatz, Elia S.; Stone, Lauren; Lim, Seh Hong; Lee, Graham; McGrath, Anna; Gisabella, Barbara; Peng, Xiaoyu; Kosoy, Eliza; Yao, Junmei; Liu, Elizabeth; Machado, Nuno J.; Weiner, Veronica S.; Slocum, Warren; Goosens, Ki A.] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 43 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Harmatz, Elia S.; Stone, Lauren; Lim, Seh Hong; Lee, Graham; McGrath, Anna; Gisabella, Barbara; Peng, Xiaoyu; Kosoy, Eliza; Yao, Junmei; Liu, Elizabeth; Machado, Nuno J.; Weiner, Veronica S.; Slocum, Warren; Goosens, Ki A.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lim, Seh Hong] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Machado, Nuno J.; Cunha, Rodrigo A.] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, Coimbra, Portugal; [Machado, Nuno J.; Cunha, Rodrigo A.] Univ Coimbra, Fac Med, Coimbra, Portugal",,"Goosens, KA (corresponding author), MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, 43 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",kgoosens@mit.edu,"Lim, Seh Hong Chris/AAA-2027-2020; Cunha, Rodrigo A/E-7475-2015; de Jesus Machado, Nuno Miguel/C-3771-2013; Goosens, Ki/ABI-6743-2020","Cunha, Rodrigo A/0000-0003-2550-6422; de Jesus Machado, Nuno Miguel/0000-0001-5097-4231; Lee, Graham/0000-0002-4676-4554; Goosens, Ki/0000-0002-5246-2261",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH084966]; U.S. Army Research Office; Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [W911NF-10-1-0059]; Deshpande Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH084966] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health Grant No. R01 MH084966 (to KAG), the U.S. Army Research Office and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Grant No. W911NF-10-1-0059 (to KAG), and the Deshpande Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (to KAG).",,67,30,30,1,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

We have reported alterations of auditory P50 suppression in human fear conditioning and extinction in healthy control subjects (Kurayama et al., 2009). In the study, P50 suppression was impaired transiently in the course of fear acquisition and extinction. In this study, we investigated the changes of P50 suppression with OCD patients in the course of the same experimental paradigm. 39 patients with OCD and 21 healthy control subjects were recruited. In the acquisition phase of classical fear conditioning, 10 pairings of the conditioned stimulus (CS; the visual stimulus from a light-emitting diode) and the unconditioned stimulus (US; the electrical stimulus to the wrist) were administered, and in the extinction phase, 10 CS without US were administered. P50 auditory evoked potentials were measured as the first stimulus sound (SI) and the second stimulus sound (S2) in double-click paradigm with a 500 ms interval. P50 S2/S1 ratio was used to evaluate P50 suppression. The mean P50 S2/S1 ratio in patients with OCD significantly elevated from baseline level during the fear acquisition as that in healthy controls, but the elevated S2/S1 ratio did not recover to baseline level. The S2/S1 ratio in the extinction phase was significantly higher in the OCD patient group than in the healthy control group. In conclusion, our data suggested that P50 sensory gating in fear extinction was impaired in patients with OCD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Less well characterized is the metabotropic GABA(B) receptor, which when activated, induces a more sustained inhibitory effect and has been implicated in regulating oscillatory activity. Few studies have been carried out utilizing GABA(B) ligands in learning, and investigations of GABA(B) in extinction have primarily focused on interactions with drugs of abuse. The current study examined changes in GABAB receptor function using the GABA(B) agonist baclofen (2 mg/mL) or the GABA(B) antagonist phaclofen (0.3 mg/mL) on trace cued and contextual fear conditioning and extinction. The compounds were either administered during training and throughout extinction in Experiment 1, or starting 24 h after training and throughout extinction in Experiment 2. All drugs were administered 1 mL/kg via intraperitoneal injection. These studies demonstrated that the administration of baclofen during training and extinction trials impaired animals' ability to extinguish the fear association to the CS, whereas the animals that were administered baclofen starting 24 h after training (Experiment 2) did display some extinction. Further, contextual fear extinction was impaired by baclofen in both experiments. Tissue analyses suggest the cued fear extinction deficit may be related to changes in the GABA(B2) receptor subunit in the amygdala. The data in the present investigation demonstrate that GABA(B) receptors play an important role in trace cued and contextual fear extinction, and may function differently than GABA(A) receptors in learning, memory, and extinction.

While PTSD affects 10-20% of individuals who experience a trauma, women are particularly susceptible to developing the disorder. Despite this notable female vulnerability, few studies have investigated this particular resistance to fear extinction observed in females. Similar to humans, rodent models of Pavlovian fear learning and extinction show a wide range of individual differences in fear learning and extinction, although female rodents are considerably understudied. Therefore, the present study examined individual differences in fear responses, including freezing behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), of female Long-Evans rats during acquisition of fear conditioning and cued fear extinction. Similar to prior studies in males, female rats displayed individual variation in freezing during cued fear extinction and were divided into extinction competent (EC) and extinction resistant (ER) phenotypes. Differences in freezing between ER and EC females were accompanied by shifts in rearing during extinction, but no darting was seen in any trial. Freezing behavior during fear learning did not differ between the EC and ER females. Vocalizations emitted in the 22 and 50 kHz ranges during fear learning and extinction were also examined. Unlike vocalizations seen in previous studies in males, very few 22 kHz distress vocalizations were emitted by female rats during fear acquisition and extinction, with no difference between ER and EC groups. Interestingly, all female rats produced significant levels of 50 kHz USVs, and EC females emitted significantly more 50 kHz USVs than ER rats. This difference in 50 kHz USVs was most apparent during initial exposure to the testing environment. These results suggest that like males, female rodents show individual differences in both freezing and USVs during fear extinction, although females appear to vocalize more in the 50 kHz range, especially during initial periods of exposure to the testing environment, and emit very few of the 22 kHz distress calls that are typically observed in males during fear learning or extinction paradigms. Overall, these findings show that female rodents display fear behavior repertoires divergent from males.","[Tryon, Sarah C.; Sakamoto, Iris M.; Kellis, Devin M.; Kaigler, Kris F.; Wilson, Marlene A.] Univ South Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol Physiol & Neurosci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Wilson, Marlene A.] Columbia VA Hlth Care Syst, Columbia, SC USA",,"Tryon, SC (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol Physiol & Neurosci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",sarah.tryon@uscmed.sc.edu,,,"United States Department of Veterans Affairs Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service (VA BLRD) [I01 BX001374]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH113892]; Merit Award [BX002664, BX001804]; UofSC Magellan Scholars award from the VP","This work was supported by Merit Award # I01 BX001374 to MW from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Service (VA BLRD), NIMH R01 MH113892 (Susan Wood PI), in part by Merit Award # BX002664 and BX001804 (Lawrence Reagan PI), and a UofSC Magellan Scholars award from the VP for Research to IS.",,95,0,0,1,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

This risk can derive from natural predators and also from direct and indirect human pressures. A starving forager will often take risks that a less hungry forager would not. At a highly seasonal and human-modified site, we predicted that arboreal samango monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus) would show highly flexible, responsive, risk-sensitive foraging. We first determined how monkeys use horizontal and vertical space across seasons to evaluate if high-risk decisions (use of gardens and ground) changed with season, a proxy for starvation risk. Then, during a subsequent winter, we offered equal feeding opportunities (in the form of high-value, raw peanuts) in both gardens and forest to see if this short-term change in food availability and starvation risk affected monkeys' foraging decisions. We found that during the food-scarce winter, monkeys foraged outside indigenous forest and in gardens, where they fed on exotic species, especially fallen acorns (Quercus spp.), despite potential threats from humans. Nevertheless, and as predicted, when given the choice of foraging on high-value foods in gardens vs. forest during our artificial foraging experiment, monkeys showed a preference for a safer forest habitat.

Sleep contributes to emotional memory consolidation and emotion regulation. Insomnia disorder (ID) is characterized by persistent sleep disturbance as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep abnormalities and often precedes or develops in parallel with PTSD and anxiety disorders. Here, we explore the impact of chronic poor sleep and sleep immediately following fear conditioning and extinction learning on preservation of extinction memories. Methods: Twenty-four ID age- and sex-matched to 24 healthy, good sleeper controls (GS) completed up to 2 weeks of habitual sleep monitoring with daily sleep-wake diaries and actigraphy, and then participated in a two-session fear conditioning, extinction learning and extinction recall procedure. Fear Conditioning and Extinction Learning occurred during session 1, followed by Extinction Recall approximately 24 hours later. Skin-conductance responses (SCR) and shock expectancies were recorded throughout all experimental phases to evaluate associative learning and memory. Overnight sleep between sessions 1 and 2 was recorded using ambulatory polysomnography. Results: ID showed greater physiological reactivity during Fear Conditioning. REM sleep physiology was associated with poorer extinction memory in ID but better extinction memory in GS. Conclusion: REM sleep physiology may differentially support emotional memory retention and expression in ID and GS. In the former, REM may enhance retention of fear memories, while in the later, REM may enhance the expression of extinction memories. Statement of Significance Incident insomnia disorder exhibits bidirectional risk with incident emotional disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Individuals with PTSD show deficits in fear extinction memory. Fear extinction learning and memory are important mechanisms supporting our ability to overcome fears, both in everyday life and during psychotherapies, such as exposure therapy, that treat PTSD. However, to date, evidence is limited as to how insomnia influences fear extinction memory or how intervening sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in particular, influence the consolidation of extinction memory. Understanding how REM sleep interacts with fear extinction memory in insomnia may provide a mechanistic link by which those with poor sleep sometimes go on to develop PTSD.","[Bottary, Ryan; Seo, Jeehye; Daffre, Carolina; Gazecki, Samuel; Moore, Kylie N.; Kopotiyenko, Konstantin; Dominguez, Jarrod P.; Lasko, Natasha B.; Pace-Schott, Edward F.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA USA; [Bottary, Ryan; Seo, Jeehye; Daffre, Carolina; Gazecki, Samuel; Moore, Kylie N.; Kopotiyenko, Konstantin; Dominguez, Jarrod P.; Lasko, Natasha B.; Pace-Schott, Edward F.] Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA USA; [Bottary, Ryan] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Seo, Jeehye; Lasko, Natasha B.; Roth, Brittainy; Pace-Schott, Edward F.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Moore, Kylie N.] Boston Univ, Ctr Syst Neurosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gannon, Karen] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Milad, Mohammed R.] NYU, Dept Psychiat, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA",,"Pace-Schott, EF (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp East CNY, 149 13th St,Room 2605, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",epace-schott@mgh.harvard.edu,,,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1R21MH101567, R01MH109638]; 2016 Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior Interfaculty Initiative","This project was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health grants 1R21MH101567 and R01MH109638 to E.P.S. and the 2016 Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior Interfaculty Initiative (E.P.S., Co-PI).",,100,5,5,2,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0161-8105,1550-9109,,SLEEP,Sleep,JUL,2020,43,7,,,,,,,zsaa007,10.1093/sleep/zsaa007,,,12,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,PS8AD,WOS:000608145900007,31993652,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2022-04-16,

The apelinergic system is widely expressed within the central nervous system (CNS). However, the role of this system in the CNS has not been completely elucidated. Utilizing an Aplnr knockout mouse model, we report here results from tests of sensory ability, locomotion, reward preference, social preference, learning and memory, and anxiety. We find that knockout of Aplnr leads to significant effects on acoustic startle response and sex-specific effects on conditioned fear responses without significant changes in baseline anxiety. In particular, male Aplnr knockout mice display enhanced context- and cue-dependent fear responses. Our results complement previous reports that exogenous Apelin administration reduced conditioned fear and freezing responses in rodent models, and future studies will explore the therapeutic benefit of APLNR-targeted drugs in rodent models of PTSD.","[Laudermilk, Lucas T.; Runyon, Scott; Maitra, Rangan] RTI Int, Ctr Drug Discovery, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Harper, Kathryn M.; Moy, Sheryl S.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Harper, Kathryn M.; Moy, Sheryl S.] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Inst Dev Disabil, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Zhou, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol, 320 Yueyang Rd,Life Sci Res Bldg A-2112, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Koller, Beverly] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,"Maitra, R (corresponding author), POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",rmaitra@rti.org,", Histology Research Core Facility/ABF-6317-2021","Harper, Kathryn/0000-0002-6297-0032; Laudermilk, Lucas/0000-0001-6181-0136",RTI International; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U01HG004085]; CSD Consortium [U01HG004080]; CHORI [U42RR024244]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [U54 HD079124];  [R01DK103625],"This work has been supported by R01DK103625 to R.M. and internal funding from RTI International.; The knockout mouse strain used for this research project was generated by the trans-NIH Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP) and obtained from the KOMP Repository (www.komp.org).NIH grants to Velocigene at Regeneron Inc (U01HG004085) and the CSD Consortium (U01HG004080) funded the generation of gene-targeted ES cells for 8500 genes in the KOMP Program and archived and distributed by the KOMP Repository at UC Davis and CHORI (U42RR024244).; The UNC CIDD Mouse Behavioral Phenotyping Laboratory is funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD; U54 HD079124).; Histological services provided by the Histology Research Core Facility in the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill NC.",,66,0,0,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4328,1872-7549,,BEHAV BRAIN RES,Behav.

In the last decade, however, this focus of animal welfare research has shifted to the consequences of these behavioural and physiological stress responses rather than only the responses per se. Modern-day farming, even with the intensification and automation requires regular monitoring and interactions by stockpeople. Research conducted in both experimental and commercial settings has shown widespread effects of the human-animal interactions on behaviour, physiology, and reproductive performance in farm animals. In this paper, we review the implications of human-animal interactions on reproduction in farm animals. A negative human-animal relationship (HAR) from the perspective of the animal is a limiting factor affecting farm animal welfare, as well as farm animal productivity. Research in farm animals has elucidated sequential relationships between stockperson attitudes, stockperson behaviour, farm animal fear behaviour, farm animal stress physiology, and farm animal productivity. In situations where stockperson attitudes to and interactions with farm animals are sub-optimal, through animal fear and stress, both animal welfare and productivity, including reproductive performance, can be compromised. There is a growing body of evidence that farm animals often seek and enjoy interacting with humans, but our understanding of the effects of a positive HAR on stress resilience and productivity in farm animals is limited. In this review, we explore the pathways by which stress induced by human-animal interactions can negatively affect farm animal reproduction, in particular, via inhibitory effects on the secretion of gonadotrophins. We also review the current knowledge of the stockperson characteristics and the nature of stockperson interactions that affect fear and physiological stress in farm animals. The contents of this review provide an insight into the importance of the HAR on farm animal welfare and reproduction while highlighting the gap in knowledge regarding the effects of a positive HAR on farm animals.","[Acharya, Rutu Y.; Hemsworth, Paul H.; Coleman, Grahame J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Anim Welf Sci Ctr, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Kinder, James E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Acharya, RY (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Anim Welf Sci Ctr, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",rutu.acharya@unimelb.edu.au; phh@unimelb.edu.au; grahame.coleman@unimelb.edu.au; kinder.15@osu.edu,,,,,,85,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,FEB,2022,12,4,,,,,,,487,10.3390/ani12040487,,,14,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,ZL6LX,WOS:000763787800001,35203194,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-16,

As expected, temporal lobectomy patients showed a general impairment in fear conditioning relative to controls. This impairment did not differ with respect to the affected hemisphere. Moreover, while fear-conditioned startle potentiation in healthy controls was independent of contingency awareness, skin conductance discrimination was only observed for those participants who correctly recognized the stimulus contingencies. Patients who acquired a declarative memory of the contingencies also showed intact skin conductance discrimination but failed to exhibit fear-potentiated startle.

Animal models have demonstrated the importance of spatial context representations within the hippocampal formation in contextualization of fear learning. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to play an important role in safety learning, possibly also through the incorporation of context information. However, if contextual representations are related to context-dependent expression of fear memory in humans remains unclear. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent functional MRI combined with a cue-context conditioning paradigm within a self-navigated virtual reality environment. The environment included two buildings (Threat and Safe context), which had distinct features outside but were identical inside. Within each context, participants saw two cues (CS+, CS-). The CS+ was consistently (100% reinforcement rate) paired with an electric shock in the Threat context, but never in the Safe context. The CS- was never paired with a shock. We found robust differential skin conductance responses (SCRs; CS+ > CS-) in the Threat context, but also within the Safe context, indicating fear generalization. Within the Safe context, vmPFC responses to the CS+ were larger than those in the Threat context. We furthermore found environment-specific representations for the two contexts in the training paradigm (i.e., before conditioning took place) in the hippocampus to be related to fear expression and generalization. Namely, participants with a weak context representation (z-score < 1.65) showed stronger fear generalization compared to participants with a strong context representation (z-score > 1.65). Thus, a weak neural representation strength of spatial context may explain overgeneralization of memory to safe contexts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that context-dependent regulation of fear expression engages ventromedial prefrontal pathways suggesting this involves a similar mechanism that is known to be involved in retrieval of extinction memory.","[de Voogd, Lycia D.; Murray, Yannick P.

The postsubiculum (PoSub) is reciprocally connected with a number of hippocampal, parahippocampal and subcortical structures that are involved in spatial learning and memory. In addition, behavioral data suggest that PoSub is needed for optimal performance during tests of spatial memory. Together, these data suggest that PoSub plays a prominent role in spatial navigation. Currently it is unknown whether the PoSub is needed for other forms of learning and memory that also require the formation of associations among multiple environmental stimuli. To address this gap in the literature we investigated the role of PoSub in Pavlovian fear conditioning. In Experiment 1 male rats received either lesions of PoSub or Sham surgery prior to training in a classical fear conditioning procedure. On the training day a tone was paired with foot shock three times. Conditioned fear to the training context was evaluated 24 hr later by placing rats back into theconditioning chamber without presenting any tones or shocks. Auditory fear was assessed on the third day by presenting the auditory stimulus in a novel environment (no shock). PoSub-lesioned rats exhibited impaired acquisition of the conditioned fear response as well as impaired expression of contextual and auditory fear conditioning. In Experiment 2, PoSub lesions were made 1 day after training to specifically assess the role of PoSub in fear memory. No deficits in the expression of contextual fear were observed, but freezing to the tone was significantly reduced in PoSub-lesioned rats compared to shams. Together, these results indicate that PoSub is necessary for normal acquisition of conditioned fear, and that PoSub contributes to the expression of auditory but not contextual fear memory.

Research on the FAM has not yielded consistent results, which may be attributed to the model itself, but could also be a product of the way fear of movement is assessed. Studies of the FAM have measured fear using verbal scales consisting of items that are often vague and have only an indirect relationship with fear. This study reports on the development of a Pictorial Fear of Activity Scale-Cervical (PFActS-C). The instrument consists of a set of photographs depicting movements in which four factors that determine biomechanical demands on the neck are systematically varied - Direction of Movement, Arm Position, Weight Bearing, and Extremity of Movement. Patients (n = 355) who had been involved in motor vehicle collisions with minimal symptoms (n = 143) and moderate to severe symptoms (n = 212) rated their fear of engaging in a set of activities depicted in the PFActS-C. Based on a principle components analysis, a 19 item measure was developed. Internal consistency (alpha = .98), stability over time (n = 44, IntraClass Correlation = .72), and construct validity were all good to excellent.

Despite being the third most common psychiatric disorder, little is known about the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors in the development of SAD. The available literature on SAD has been compared with data on the genetics and environmental impact on the phenotypic expression of fear and anxiety, and its implicated neurobiology, in order to explore the neurobiology of SAD as understood through the neurochemical dysregulation expressed in fear and anxiety. Method: A systematic review of the literature was employed for the years from 1966 to 2001. Results: SAD does indeed have much overlap with fear and anxiety. This is best demonstrated by the interactions of the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems with each other and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Conclusion: SAD may well be understood as one potential outcome for predisposed individuals who are exposed to the proverbial 'second hit', or environmental insult, in childhood. Behavioral inhibition may be an early expression of this predisposition, with natural progression to SAD occurring via a disruption of neurochemical homeostasis. Through animal and human data it has become evident that fear and anxiety have shared, as well as distinct, neurochemical and neuroanatomical pathways. These similarities are expressed as symptoms and objective signs that are common to many individuals with social anxiety disorder.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Marcin, MS (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1639 Pierce Dr,4000, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",marcinms@bigfoot.com,,"Nemeroff, Charles/0000-0001-7867-1160","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH042088, P50MH058922] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH-42088, MH-58922] Funding Source: Medline",,,117,22,24,4,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0001-690X,1600-0447,,ACTA PSYCHIAT SCAND,Acta Psychiatr.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a genetic relationship exists between innate alcohol preference and propensity to develop learned fear, using the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) paradigm, in 2 mouse lines selectively bred for high or low alcohol preference. Methods: Alcohol-naive, male, and female mice from replicate pairs of lines selectively bred for high alcohol preference and low alcohol preference were randomly assigned to a fear-conditioned or control group. Mice in the fear-conditioned group received 20 pairings of a light stimulus and footshock; the control group received the same number of exposures to light and footshock, except that these stimuli were explicitly unpaired. During testing for FPS, acoustic stimuli were presented both in the presence and in the absence of the light stimulus. Results: In both replicate pairs of lines, mice selectively bred for high alcohol preference showed greater FPS than mice selectively bred for low alcohol preference. No sex differences in FPS were found in any line. Control groups did not show FPS. Conclusion: These findings suggest that common genes mediate both innate alcohol preference and propensity to develop learned fear in these selected mouse lines.","Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Chester, JA (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, 703 3rd St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jchester@psych.purdue.edu,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R03AA015424] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [AA015424] Funding Source: Medline,,,50,25,25,0,5,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0145-6008,,,ALCOHOL CLIN EXP RES,Alcoholism (NY),JUL,2007,31,7,,,,,1081,1088,,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00396.x,,,8,Substance Abuse,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Substance Abuse,179VO,WOS:000247318400001,17451404,,,,2022-04-16,

This paper continues this theme by addressing the use of risk assessment to integrate people into a single assessment. In a broad overview of the risk assessment process we stress the need to build a conceptual model of the whole system including multiple species (humans and other ecological entities), stressors, and cumulative effects. We also propose converging landscape ecology and evaluation of ecosystem services with risk assessment to address these cumulative responses. We first look at how this integration can occur within the problem formulation step in risk assessment where the system is defined, a conceptual model created, a subset of components and functions selected, and the analytical framework decided in a context that includes the management decisions. A variety of examples of problem formulations (salmon, wild insects, hyporheic ecosystems, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, nitrogen fertilization, toxic chemicals, and oil spills) are presented to illustrate how treating humans as components of the landscape can add value to risk assessments. We conclude that the risk assessment process should help address the urgent needs of society in proportion to importance, to provide a format to communicate knowledge and understanding, and to inform policy and management decisions.

Its role in human fear conditioning has, however, received limited attention. The current meta-analysis examines the loci of cerebellar contributions to fear conditioning in healthy subjects, thus mapping, for the first time, the neural response to conditioned aversive stimuli onto the cerebellum. By using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique for analyses, we identified several distinct regions in the cerebellum that activate in response to the presentation of the conditioned stimulus: the cerebellar tonsils, lobules HIV-VI, and the culmen. These regions have separately been implicated in fear acquisition, consolidation of fear memories and expression of conditioned fear responses. Their specific role in these processes may be attributed to the general contribution of cerebellar cortical networks to timing and prediction. Our meta-analysis highlights the potential role of the cerebellum in human cognition and emotion in general, and addresses the possibility how deficits in associative cerebellar learning may play a role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Future studies are needed to further clarify the mechanistic role of the cerebellum in higher order functions and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Proposed mechanisms include enhanced fear learning and impaired extinction or extinction recall. Documented extinction recall deficits and failure to use safety signals could result from general failure to use contextual information, a hippocampus-dependent process. This can be probed by adding a renewal phase to standard conditioning and extinction paradigms. Human subjects with PTSD and combat controls were conditioned (skin conductance response), extinguished, and tested for extinction retention and renewal in a scanner (fMRI). Fear conditioning (light paired with shock) occurred in one context, followed by extinction in another, to create danger and safety contexts. The next day, the extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS + E) was re-presented to assess extinction recall (safety context) and fear renewal (danger context). PTSD patients showed impaired extinction recall, with increased skin conductance and heightened amygdala activity to the extinguished CS + in the safety context. However, they also showed impaired fear renewal; in the danger context, they had less skin conductance response to CS + E and lower activity in amygdala and ventral-medial prefrontal cortex compared with combat controls. Control subjects displayed appropriate contextual modulation of memory recall, with extinction (safety) memory prevailing in the safety context, and fear memory prevailing in the danger context. PTSD patients could not use safety context to sustain suppression of extinguished fear memory, but they also less effectively used danger context to enhance fear. They did not display globally enhanced fear expression, but rather showed a globally diminished capacity to use contextual information to modulate fear expression.","[Garfinkel, Sarah N.; Abelson, James L.; King, Anthony P.; Sripada, Rebecca K.; Wang, Xin; Gaines, Laura M.; Liberzon, Israel] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Garfinkel, Sarah N.] Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton BN1 9RR, E Sussex, England; [Sripada, Rebecca K.; Liberzon, Israel] Ann Arbor Vet Affairs, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA",,"Garfinkel, SN (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Clin Sci Imaging Ctr, Brighton BN1 9RR, E Sussex, England.",s.garfinkel@bsms.ac.uk,", Anthony/AAG-9308-2019","Garfinkel, Sarah/0000-0002-5961-1012; Sripada, Rebecca/0000-0002-2844-3458; King, Anthony/0000-0002-0764-9625",Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research [U028028]; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R24 MH075999]; Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center [W81XWH-08-2-0208]; University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics Pilot Grant Program; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R24MH075999] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"The research reported in this article was supported by grants from the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (U028028) to S.N.G., the National Institute of Mental Health (R24 MH075999) to I.

We found only a weak effect of such generalization of GS extinction either back to CS + or to a different GS, on either US expectancy or skin conductance measures. In other words, despite extinction trials with a stimulus highly similar to CS +, participants showed a return of fear when tested with CS + or a novel GS. However this responding declined rapidly over non-reinforced test trials. Trait anxious participants showed higher overall US expectancy ratings in the extinction and test phases, and slower extinction of expectancy, relative to low anxious participants. These results may help explain why exposure therapy, which is unlikely to reproduce the exact stimuli present at acquisition, sometimes fails to transfer to other fear-eliciting stimuli subsequently encountered by anxious clients. The generalization of GS extinction paradigm might provide a useful testbed for evaluation of interventions designed to enhance transfer, such as exposure to multiple diverse exemplars.","[Wong, Alex H.

Such contamination can also directly affect human health when irrigated crops are primarily used for human consumption. Therefore, a large number of humans are potentially at risk worldwide due to daily As exposure. Numerous previous Studies have been severely limited by small sample sizes which are not reliably extrapolated to large populations or landscapes. Human As exposure and risk assessment are no longer simple assessments limited to a few food samples from a small area. The focus of more recent studies has been to perform risk assessment at the landscape level involving the use of biomarkers to identify and quantify appropriate health problems and large surveys of human dietary patterns, supported by analytical testing of food, to quantify exposure. This approach generates large amounts of data from a wide variety of sources and geographic information system (GIS) techniques have been used widely to integrate the various spatial, demographic, social, field, and laboratory measured datasets. With the current worldwide shift in emphasis from qualitative to quantitative risk assessment, it is likely that future research efforts will be directed towards the integration of GIS, statistics, chemistry, and other dynamic models within a common platform to quantify human health risk at the landscape level.

Some methodologies cluster hundreds of hydrocarbon substances into one single parameter, total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) ranged from C10 to C40. Several national policies establish a maximum acceptable concentration in soil to directly consider if a site is seriously contaminated; this scope may be described as a total content approach. Another approach considers TPH division into fractions according to their physico-chemical and toxicological properties, performed in terms of the environmental behavior (aliphatic and aromatic compounds) and the equivalent carbon number (EC). This approach lets us determine the associated risk for human health through the Human Risk Index (HRI). The consequences of application of the total content and fraction approaches is discussed in this study, evaluating the differences in the approach for volatile and semi-volatile hydrocarbons and also in regard to the origin of the contamination. When focusing on volatile substances, the fraction approach is much more restrictive than the total content approach where all oil products are assessed in the same way. When assessing semi-volatile hydrocarbons, their behavior varies depending on the oil product.

A preliminary scan of the literature shows that people are not just passive maleficiaries of risk but are also active participants in its inception. People are actors whose biases and behaviors give rise to risk and make an impact on both the degree of its likelihood and the severity of its consequences. Because people themselves undertake risk analysis (either as experts and/or stakeholders), the risk analysis process itself is subject to biases and human error. Therefore, it is argued that human factors must be explicitly brought into risk conceptualization, analysis, and theory development in order to enrich and extend the frontiers of the field. Scholarly contributions by members of the Society for Risk Analysis Australia and New Zealand (SRA-ANZ) investigating the challenges and complexities of incorporating people in risk analysis are introduced in this issue.","[Seno-Alday, Sandra] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Discipline Int Business, Rm 4107 Abercrombie Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,"Seno-Alday, S (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Discipline Int Business, Rm 4107 Abercrombie Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sandra.seno-alday@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,53,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

In recent years, neuroimaging work has yielded a detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying fear conditioning common across participants, however only a minority of studies have investigated the brain basis of inter-individual variation in fear learning. Moreover, the majority of these studies have employed small sample sizes (mean n=17; range n=5-27) and all have failed to meet the minimum recommended sample size for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of individual differences. Here, using fMRI, we analyzed blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response recorded simultaneously with skin conductance response (SCR) and ratings of unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy in 49 participants undergoing Pavlovian fear conditioning. On average, participants became conditioned to the conditioned stimulus (CS+; higher US expectancy ratings and SCR for the CS+ compared to the unpaired conditioned stimulus, CS-); the CS+ also robustly increased activation in the bilateral insula. Amygdala activation was revealed from a regression analysis that incorporated individual differences in fear conditionability (i.e., a between-subjects regressor of mean CS+ > CS- SCR). By replicating results observed using much smaller sample sizes, the results confirm that variation in amygdala reactivity covaries with individual differences in fear conditionability. The link between behavior (SCR) and brain (amygdala reactivity) may be a putative endophenotype for the acquisition of fear memories. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Such epigenetic programming is also assumed to play an important role in the transgenerational transmission of PTSD in humans. Here we studied whether even subtle within-subject differences in maternal care caused by increasing mothering experience from the first to the second litter - can determine subsequent vulnerability for PTSD-like behaviour. To assess the influence of maternal experience on different components of fear, we analysed the adult male offspring of two subsequent litters (offspring 1, 2) from the same parental C57BL/6NCrl (B6N) and C57BL/6JOla (B6JOla) mice for (i) their innate anxiety behaviour on a modified hole board and (ii) their vulnerability to develop long-lasting PTSD-like fear symptoms (hyperarousal, contextually conditioned fear) following perception of an inescapable foot shock. Increasing maternal experience reduced the animals' innate fear on the modified hole board (more exploration, less inhibition), the acute stress reaction to the shock and - one month after trauma - the levels of hyperarousal-like behaviour in the PTSD-prone B6N strain. In contrast, both acquisition and extinction of contextually conditioned fear were increased in the second offspring, representing cognitive flexibility. A factor analysis showed that innate fear, hyperarousal and conditioned fear represent independent behavioural dimensions. In conclusion, the present study identifies maternal inexperience as a risk factor for the development of IPTSD-like symptoms. This effect - occurring in inbred mice on an almost identical genetic background - emphasizes the impact of epigenetic factors in PTSD-like behaviour. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This may result in wide variability in the estimates of chemical exposure and risk. A comparison of human health risk assessment approaches practiced at the provincial level in Canada was undertaken, wherein each jurisdiction's approach was applied to a hypothetical contaminated site. Approaches were found to vary both in terms of methodological considerations, and in matters of policy. The exercise yielded results in terms of estimated exposures and predicted hazard quotients/indexes and incremental lifetime cancer risks that were in some cases quite consistent (varying by a factor of less than 1.5 times), and in other cases remarkably different (varying by orders of magnitude).

Although studying ungulate ecology of fear is common, knowledge from ungulate systems is highly contested among ecologists. Here, we review the available literature on the ecology of fear in ungulates to generalize our current knowledge and how we can leverage it for conservation. Four general focus areas emerged from the 275 papers included in our literature search (and some papers were included in multiple categories): behavioral responses to predation risk (79%), physiological responses to predation risk (15%), trophic cascades resulting from ungulate responses to predation risk (20%), and manipulation of predation risk (1%). Of papers focused on behavior, 75% were about movement and habitat selection. Studies were biased toward North America (53%), tended to be focused on elk (Cervus canadensis; 29%), and were dominated by gray wolves (40%) or humans (39%) as predators of interest. Emerging literature suggests that we can utilize predation risk for conservation with top-down (i.e., increasing predation risk) and bottom-up (i.e., manipulating landscape characteristics to increase risk or risk perception) approaches. It is less clear whether fear-related changes in physiology have population-level fitness consequences or cascading effects, which could be fruitful avenues for future research. Conflicting evidence of trait-mediated trophic cascades might be improved with better replication across systems and accounting for confounding effects of ungulate density. Improving our understanding of mechanisms modulating the nature of trophic cascades likely is most important to ensure desirable conservation outcomes. We recommend future work embrace the complexity of natural systems by attempting to link together the focal areas of study identified herein.","[Chitwood, M.

Despite substantial comorbidity between alcohol dependence (ALC) and anxiety disorders and reports of altered negative emotion processing in ALC, neural correlates of FCE in this clinical population remain unknown. Here, we used a 2-day fear learning paradigm in 43 healthy participants and 43 individuals with ALC at the National Institutes of Health. Main outcomes of this multimodal study included structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging, clinical measures, as well as skin conductance responses (SCRs) to confirm differential conditioning. Successful FCE was demonstrated across participants by differential SCRs in the conditioning phase and no difference in SCRs to the conditioned stimuli in the extinction phase. The ALC group showed significantly reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in the right amygdala during conditioning (Cohen's d = .89, P-(FWE) = .037) and in the left amygdala during fear renewal (Cohen's d = .68, P-(FWE) = .039). Right amygdala activation during conditioning was significantly correlated with ALC severity (r = .39, P-(Bonferroni) = .009), depressive symptoms (r = .37, P-(Bonferroni) = .015), trait anxiety (r = .41, P-(Bonferroni) = .006), and perceived stress (r = .45, P-(Bonferroni) = .002). Our data suggest that individuals with ALC have dysregulated fear learning, in particular, dysregulated neural activation patterns, in the amygdala. Furthermore, amygdala activation during fear conditioning was associated with ALC-related clinical measures. The FCE paradigm may be a promising tool to investigate structures involved in negative affect regulation, which might inform the development of novel treatment approaches for ALC.","[Muench, Christine; Charlet, Katrin; Lohoff, Falk W.] NIAAA, Sect Clin Genom & Expt Therapeut, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Balderston, Nicholas L.; Grillon, Christian] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Heilig, Markus] Linkoping Univ, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Linkoping, Sweden; [Cortes, Carlos R.; Momenan, Reza] NIAAA, Clin NeuroImaging Res Core, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Lohoff, FW (corresponding author), NIAAA, Sect Clin Genom & Expt Therapeut CGET, NIH, 10 Ctr Dr 10CRC-2-2352, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",falk.lohoff@nih.gov,"ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020","Momenan, Reza/0000-0002-7624-9676",National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [ZIA-AA000242]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG CH1936/1-1],"National Institutes of Health (NIH), Grant/Award Number: ZIA-AA000242; German Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DFG CH1936/1-1",,56,3,3,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1355-6215,1369-1600,,ADDICT BIOL,Addict.

Considering the safety of systemically administered cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-psychotomimetic component of Cannabis sativa, to animals and humans, the present study sought to investigate whether and how this phytocannabinoid (3-30 mg/kg intraperitoneally; i.p.) could mitigate an established memory, by blockade of its reconsolidation, evaluated in a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm in rats. We report that CBD is able to disrupt 1- and 7-days-old memories when administered immediately, but not 6 h, after their retrieval for 3 min, with the dose of 10 mg/kg being the most effective. This effect persists in either case for at least 1 week, but is prevented when memory reactivation was omitted, or when the cannabinoid type-1 receptors were antagonized selectively with AM251 (1.0 mg/kg). Pretreatment with the serotonin type-1A receptor antagonist WAY100635, however, failed to block CBD effects. These results highlight that recent and older fear memories are equally vulnerable to disruption induced by CBD through reconsolidation blockade, with a consequent long-lasting relief in contextual fear-induced freezing. Importantly, this CBD effect is dependent on memory reactivation, restricted to time window of <6h, and is possibly dependent on cannabinoid type-1 receptor-mediated signaling mechanisms. We also observed that the fear memories disrupted by CBD treatment do not show reinstatement or spontaneous recovery over 22 days. These findings support the view that reconsolidation blockade, rather than facilitated extinction, accounts for the aforementioned CBD results in our experimental conditions.

This study examined the effects of dexamethasone administration on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD. We used an established fear discrimination procedure, in which one visual stimulus (CS+, danger cue) was paired with aversive airblasts to the throat (unconditioned stimulus, US), and another stimulus (CS-, safety cue) was presented without airblasts. In addition to FPS, the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was performed. The study sample (N = 100) was recruited from a highly traumatized civilian population in Atlanta, GA. Half of the subjects (n = 54, 16 PTSD, 38 controls) underwent conditioning at baseline and the other half (n = 46, 17 PTSD, 29 controls) after DST, in a cross-sectional design. We found a significant interaction effect of diagnostic group and dexamethasone treatment. Under baseline conditions, subjects with PTSD showed more than twice as much fear-potentiated startle to the danger cue compared to traumatized controls, F(1,53) = 8.08, p = 0.006. However, there was no group difference in subjects tested after dexamethasone suppression. Furthermore, there was a significant treatment effect in PTSD subjects but not in controls, with dexamethasone reducing fear-potentiated startle to the CS+, F(1,32) = 4.00, p = 0.05. There was also a positive correlation between PTSD subjects' FPS and cortisol levels, r = 0.46, p = 0.01. These results suggest that transient suppression of HPA function via dexamethasone suppression may reduce exaggerated fear in patients with PTSD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the voices that speak about such fears is the narrative literature. In the present article we try to bring forward some of the many examples which under the shape of a novel hide bioethical issues. The passage that bioethics carries out from the simple theoretical concept to legal expression finds an intermezzo in the social field to which literature is in a privileged way connected. Edgar Allen Poe in his fantasy stories expresses fears regarding premature deaths caused by organ takings, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein desecrates the dignity of human corpses, in Heart of a Dog Mihail Bulgakov speaks about a psychosis of change caused by a xenotransplant, whereas with Dominique Lapierre (The city of joy) one comes upon a very actual problem: the organ trade.

Recent behavioral evidence suggests that the neuropeptide tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39), via its receptor, the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2R), modulates fear memory. Here we examined the anatomical and cellular localization of TIP39 signaling that contributes to the increase in fear memory over time following a traumatic event, called fear memory incubation. Contextual freezing, a behavioral sign of fear memory, was significantly greater in PTH2R knock-out than wild-type male mice 2 and 4 weeks after a 2 s 1.5 mA footshock. PTH2R knock-out mice had significantly reduced c-Fos activation in the medial amygdala (MeA) following both footshock and fear recall, but had normal activation in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the amygdalar central nucleus compared with wild-type. We therefore investigated the contribution of MeA TIP39 signaling to fear incubation. Similar to the effect of global TIP39 signaling loss, blockade of TIP39 signaling in the MeA by lentivirus-mediated expression of a secreted PTH2R antagonist augmented fear incubation. Ablation of MeA PTH2R-expressing neurons also strengthened the fear incubation effect. Using the designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug pharmacogenetic approach, transient inhibition of MeA PTH2R-expressing neurons before or immediately after the footshock, but not at the time of fear recall, enhanced fear incubation. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that TIP39 signaling within the MeA at the time of an aversive event regulates the increase over time in fear associated with the event context.","[Tsuda, Mumeko C.; Yeung, Ho-Man; Kuo, Jonathan; Usdin, Ted B.] NIMH, Sect Fundamental Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Usdin, TB (corresponding author), NIMH, Sect Fundamental Neurosci, Bldg 35,Room 1B-215,35 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",usdint@mail.nih.gov,,"Yeung, Ho-Man/0000-0002-7188-9738",Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIA-MH002685]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002685] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health (ZIA-MH002685).

Disruption in the detection and response of the brain's fear system is commonly observed in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FXS), a brain disorder characterized by variable cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances such as social avoidance and anxiety. The amygdala is highly involved in mediating fear processing, and increasing evidence supports the idea that inhibitory circuits play a key role in regulating the flow of information associated with fear conditioning in the amygdala. Here, we review the known and potential importance of amygdala fear circuits in FXS, and how developmental studies are critical to understand the formation and function of neuronal circuits that modulate amygdala-based behaviors.

Bilateral lesions of the auditory thalamus prevent the expression of fear to an auditory stimulus paired with shock. The present study assessed whether bilateral lesions of the auditory thalamus would also disrupt the inhibition of fear to an auditory stimulus paired with the absence of shock. Rats were given bilateral lesions of the auditory thalamus followed by PavIovian conditioned inhibition training in which a light was paired with shock and a noise and light compound was presented in the absence of shock. Fear and the inhibition of fear were measured with the fear-potentiated startle effect. Lesions of the auditory thalamus did not disrupt the ability of the noise to inhibit the expression of fear to the light. However, these lesions did disrupt the ability of the noise to produce fear-potentiated startle after it had been subsequently paired with shock. These results suggest that although the auditory thalamus is an essential part of a neural circuit that mediates the expression of fear to auditory stimuli, it is not an essential part of the circuit that mediates the inhibition of fear to auditory stimuli.

The first component (which explained 30.1% (I), 29.4% (S) and 34.8% (H) of the total variance) was interpreted as anxiety or fear induced by social isolation which is common to the three tests. Effectively, eight variables related to feeding, locomotor activity and localisation in the test pen showed consistent and high loadings on component 1 for the three tests. In order to simplify the methodology, a 'fear mark' was computed using the three major items related to component 1 for the three tests: the time spent feeding, the time in square 5 (location of the trough) and in squares 1, 2 and 3 (away from the stimulus and the trough). This method of scoring allows positioning of an animal on a continuous scale and therefore direct comparisons with other groups of animals, using a simplified methodology. Other behavioural variables showed high loadings on component 2 in S and in H: this component was interpreted in terms of 'close interaction' with the stimulus in S and in terms of 'panic' in H. An 'interaction mark' (S) and a 'panic mark' (H) were computed using the major behavioural items. These marks could improve the interpretation of behavioural reactions of sheep towards a surprise effect and the presence of an immobile human. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Pavlovian fear conditioning is a key tool for the study of fundamental aspects of fear learning. Here, we used a selected mouse line of High and Low Pavlovian conditioned fear created from an advanced intercrossed line (AIL) in order to begin to identify the cellular basis of phenotypic divergence in Pavlovian fear conditioning. We investigated whether phosphorylated MAPK (p44/42 ERK/MAPK), a protein kinase required in the amygdala for the acquisition and consolidation of Pavlovian fear memory, is differentially expressed following Pavlovian fear learning in the High and Low fear lines. We found that following Pavlovian auditory fear conditioning, High and Low line mice differ in the number of pMAPK-expressing neurons in the dorsal sub nucleus of the lateral amygdala (LAd). In contrast, this difference was not detected in the ventral medial (LAvm) or ventral lateral (LAv1) amygdala sub nuclei or in control animals. We propose that this apparent increase in plasticity at a known locus of fear memory acquisition and consolidation relates to intrinsic differences between the two fear phenotypes. These data provide important insights into the micronetwork mechanisms encoding phenotypic differences in fear. Understanding the circuit level cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie individual variability in fear learning is critical for the development of effective treatment of fear-related illnesses such as PTSD.

Impaired learning of contingencies around negative outcomes may influence such drug-use patterns. To our knowledge, no studies to date have examined fear conditioning in drug-dependent humans, nor have they investigated the association between fear conditioning outcomes and neuropsychological functioning. The current study compared de novo fear conditioning in a sample of opiate-dependent outpatients to that in a healthy and an affective-disordered sample in an attempt to isolate the contribution of substance dependence on conditioning outcomes, relative to the substantial comorbidity present in substance using samples. Additionally, a brief neuropsychological battery was completed in the substance dependent sample. We found consistent evidence across three indices of fear acquisition-simple conditioning, differential conditioning, and contingency awareness-that the opiate-dependent learned the cue association less well than the control groups. Some of these deficits were significantly related to impairments in attention and memory. As such, substance use and/or associated neuropsychological impairments may make associative learning difficult, and may contribute to the persistence of maladaptive patterns and the failure to change behavior in response to aversive outcomes.","[Basden, Shawnee L.; Otto, Michael W.] Boston Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 648 Beacon St,Floor 6, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Orr, Scott P.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Orr, Scott P.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA",,"Otto, MW (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 648 Beacon St,Floor 6, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",mwotto@bu.edu,,"Otto, Michael/0000-0002-8915-7578",NIDAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [DA017904]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH072165],"Work on this project was supported in part by a NIDA minority supplement to the first author through DA017904.

They might serve as dual-purpose and robust strains that have advantageous behaviors, such as exploration and reduced fear reactions, which might support animal welfare in general. Therefore, it is important to characterize welfare-related behaviors, such as fear and exploration, and to identify these behavioral traits among the diversity of chicken strains. The aim of this study was to characterize fear reactions and exploration based on the avoidance of a novel object and the avoidance of a human in three different chicken strains. To identify interesting alternatives for future poultry production, a layer hybrid (Lohmann Brown), a dual-purpose hybrid (Lohmann Dual) and a locally adapted strain (Rhinelander) were tested for their fear and exploration behavior towards unknown objects and humans. Results showed clear differences in fear and exploration between all three strains, regarding fear of objects and humans. The strain-specific results illustrate the high diversity of behavioral traits. The understanding of behavioral diversity, including fear and exploration, might contribute substantially to future breeding programs, including of commercial strains, and the preservation of local strains in general, which can improve animal welfare on a genetic and individual basis. Fear and exploration are crucial traits determining how animals behave in novel situations, and thus, they influence animal welfare. The aim of this study was the characterization of these behavioral traits among different strains to identify interesting alternatives for future poultry production. Whereas the Novel Object Test (NOT) focuses on fear and exploration of novel objects, the Avoidance Distance Test (ADT) addresses this in the context of humans. Here, a commercial hybrid line, a dual-purpose hybrid and a local adapted strain were tested. For the differences between strains and development of fear, Lohmann Brown (n = 714), Lohmann Dual (n = 844) and Rhinelander (n = 458) were observed weekly until maturity. Results show that fear and exploration towards unknown objects and humans are breed-specific (all p < 0.01). Additionally, development of fear in NOT and ADT differed between all three strains (both p < 0.01). The expressions of fear of humans or objects should be regarded as characteristics adapted for different husbandry systems and breeding goals, e.g., high exploratory behavior in aviary or high avoidance of predators in free-ranging husbandry or at least a balanced ratio between fear and exploration. Characterization of behavioral traits among different strains, understanding diversity and integrating these behaviors into future breeding and husbandry systems might reflect the need to preserve local strains and the potential to improve animal welfare.","[Meuser, Verena; Hillemacher, Sonja; Tiemann, Inga] Univ Bonn, Inst Agr Engn, Agr Fac, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Weinhold, Leonie] Univ Hosp Bonn, Inst Med Biometry Informat & Epidemiol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Tiemann, Inga] Univ Bonn, Inst Anim Sci, Agr Fac, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",,"Meuser, V (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Agr Engn, Agr Fac, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",verena.meuser@uni-bonn.de; weinhold@imbie.meb.uni-bonn.de; sonja.hillemacher@uni-bonn.de; inga.tiemann@uni-bonn.de,"Weinhold, Leonie/ABE-6091-2021","Tiemann, Inga/0000-0002-3607-4453","Ministry for Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia [17-02.04.01-05/2018]","Part of this research (development observations) was funded by the Ministry for Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, grant number 17-02.04.01-05/2018.",,47,1,1,9,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAR,2021,11,3,,,,,,,679,10.3390/ani11030679,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,RD1BB,WOS:000633221600001,33806293,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-16,

Appropriate fear learning can selectively facilitate early sensory processing of threat-predictive stimuli, but it is unknown if fear generalization has similarly generalized neurosensory consequences. We performed in vivo optical neurophysiology to visualize odor-evoked neural activity in populations of periglomerular interneurons in the olfactory bulb 1 day before, 1 day after, and 1 month after each mouse underwent an olfactory fear conditioning paradigm designed to promote generalized fear of odors. Behavioral and neurophysiological changes were assessed in response to a panel of odors that varied in similarity to the threat predictive odor at each time point. After conditioning, all odors evoked similar levels of freezing behavior, regardless of similarity to the threat-predictive odor. Freezing significantly correlated with large changes in odor-evoked periglomerular cell activity, including a robust, generalized facilitation of the response to all odors, broadened odor tuning, and increased neural responses to lower odor concentrations. These generalized effects occurred within 24 h of a single conditioning session, persisted for at least 1 month, and were detectable even in the first moments of the brain's response to odors. The finding that generalized fear includes altered early sensory processing of not only the threat-predictive stimulus but also novel though categorically-similar stimuli may have important implications for the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders with sensory sequelae.","[Kass, Marley D.; McGann, John P.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Behav & Syst Neurosci Sect, 152 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",,"McGann, JP (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Behav & Syst Neurosci Sect, 152 Frelinghuysen Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",john.mcgann@rutgers.edu,,"Kass, Marley/0000-0003-2460-9366","National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication DisordersUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01 DC013090, F31 DC013719]; National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH101293]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH101293] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [F31DC013719, R01DC013090] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [R01 DC013090 to JPM and F31 DC013719 to MDK] and the National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH101293 to JPM)] at the National Institutes of Health.

It implies that the risk in process industries is crossing the limit of safe practices. Most major accidents consist of human errors and mechanical component failures, and cannot be explained by a stochastic coincidence of independent events. This work focuses on the coincidence of human error and mechanical failure to introduce a concept of dynamic management of human error. By the dynamic management of human error during a short period, when a mechanical component is temporarily unavailable during periodic testing or maintenance, the probability of a major accident may be reduced significantly without additional investment on improving safety. For the periodically-tested standby component, the majority of total average unavailability of the component may be recognized by operators or workers as well as maintenance mechanics. During this short period, an appropriate dynamic management of human error for improving human performance temporarily may be very effective in reducing total risk in industries. The dynamic management of human error may be a useful method to prevent loss effectively in the process industries (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Current treatment options leave room for improvement and the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has become a key target in psychopharmacological research. Rodent models suggest an anxiolytic effect of endocannabinoids and demonstrated that the ECS is involved in the modulation of fear learning and aversive memory consolidation. So far, one prominent target was inhibition of fatty acid amino hydrolase (FAAH), the degrading enzyme of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). Research in humans remains scarce, but genetic studies have found that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) FAAH C385A (rs324420) is associated with lower catabolic performance of FAAH and increased levels of AEA. Translational research on the ECS in fear learning processes is rare, yet crucial to understand the mechanisms involved. To address this lack of research, we designed a fear conditioning, extinction learning paradigm with 51 healthy, male humans who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before analysing baseline and task-related changes of AEA, as well as the FAAH polymorphism (rs324420). The results indicate higher AEA levels in AC-heterozygotes than in CC-individuals (SNP rs324420), but no difference between the groups during extinction learning. However, neural activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insular cortex during extinction learning correlated positively with AEA baseline levels, and task-related changes in AEA were found particularly during fear extinction, with a modulatory effect on neural activation related to extinction learning. Results indicate a putative role for AEA in fear extinction learning. Pre-treatment with AEA-enhancing drugs could promote extinction learning during psychotherapeutic interventions.","[Spohrs, Jennifer; Plener, Paul Lukas; Fegert, Joerg Michael] Ulm Univ, Clin Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychotherapy, Ulm, Germany; [Ulrich, Martin; Groen, Georg; Prost, Michael; Abler, Birgit] Ulm Univ, Clin Psychiat Psychotherapy 3, Ulm, Germany; [Plener, Paul Lukas] Univ Vienna, Clin Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Vienna, Austria; [Bindila, Laura] Mainz Univ, Dept Physiol Chem Lipid, Mainz, Germany",,"Abler, B (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Clin Psychiat Psychotherapy 3, Ulm, Germany.",birgit.abler@uni-ulm.de,,"Ulrich, Martin/0000-0002-1237-0426; Gron, Georg/0000-0002-0282-3575; Plener, Paul/0000-0003-4333-1494",,,,77,5,5,1,3,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2158-3188,,,TRANSL PSYCHIAT,Transl.

Research on emotion was pioneered by Darwin's work on emotional expressions in humans and animals. But Darwin was concerned mainly with facial and bodily expressions of significance for humans, citing mainly examples from mammals (e.g., apes, dogs, and cats). In birds, emotional expressions are less evident for a human observer, so a different approach is needed. Understanding avian emotions will provide key evolutionary information on the evolution of related behaviors and brain circuitry. Birds and mammals are thought to have evolved from different groups of Mesozoic reptiles, theropod dinosaurs and therapsids, respectively, and therefore, their common ancestor is likely to be a basal reptile living about 300 million years ago, during the Carboniferous or Permian period. Yet, birds and mammals exhibit extensive convergence in terms of relative brain size, high levels of activity, sleep/wakefulness cycles, endothermy, and social behavior, among others. This article focuses on two basic emotions with negative valence: fear and frustration. Fear is related to the anticipation of dangerous or threatening stimuli (e.g., predators or aggressive conspecifics). Frustration is related to unexpected reward omissions or devaluations (e.g., loss of food or sexual resources). These results have implications for an understanding of the conditions that promote fear and frustration and for the evolution of supporting brain circuitry.","[Papini, Mauricio R.] Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Penagos-Corzo, Julio C.] Univ Americas Puebla, Cholula, Mexico; [Perez-Acosta, Andres M.] Univ Rosario, Bogota, Colombia",,"Papini, MR (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.; Penagos-Corzo, JC (corresponding author), Univ Americas Puebla, Cholula, Mexico.; Perez-Acosta, AM (corresponding author), Univ Rosario, Bogota, Colombia.",m.papini@tcu.edu; julioc.penagos@udlap.mx; andres.perez@urosario.edu.co,"Perez-Acosta, Andres M./C-1561-2013","Perez-Acosta, Andres M./0000-0002-1133-8926; Penagos-Corzo, Julio/0000-0002-4879-3033","COLCIENCIASDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias; Universidad del Rosario; Fundacion para el Avance de la Psicologia, Colombia; Programa de Movilidad Internacional de Investigadores e innovadores a Eventos y Estancias de Corta Duracion [395-2007]","AP-A was supported by funds from COLCIENCIAS, Universidad del Rosario, and Fundacion para el Avance de la Psicologia, Colombia.

On one hand, NPS increases wakefulness and arousal. On the other, NPS produces anxiolytic-like effects by acutely reducing fear responses as well as modulating long-term aspects of fear memory, such as attenuation of contextual fear or enhancement of fear extinction. The main sources of NPS in the brain are a few clusters of NPS-producing neurons in the brainstem. NPS binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor that is highly conserved among vertebrates and stimulates mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ as well as activation of protein kinases. In synaptic circuits within the amygdala, which are important for processing of acute fear as well as formation and expression of fear memories, NPS causes increased release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate, especially in synaptic contacts to a subset of GABAergic interneurons. Polymorphisms in the human NPS receptor gene have been associated with altered sleep behavior and panic disorder. In conclusion, the NPS system displays a unique physiological profile with respect to the specificity and time course of its actions. These functions could provide interesting opportunities for both basic research and clinical applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the intergenerational patterns of health and behavior, and previous links between childhood trauma and BDNF methylation and expression, this study investigated the potential for maternal history of traumatic experiences to influence development in her newborn, via changes in her newborn's BDNF methylation and expression. We found that mothers' trauma history was associated with epigenetic regulation of BDNF in their newborns. Moreover, the association between maternal trauma and BDNF methylation and expression patterns were moderated by newborn sex. Male newborns showed increased BDNF expression with maternal exposure to child abuse (p = .001), and increased BDNF methylation with greater maternal fear (p = .001). Female newborns showed reduced BDNF expression with greater maternal fear (p = .004). Practitioners strive to identify prevention and intervention avenues that will reduce the harmful effects of trauma. Future research should consider the potential for maternal historical trauma experiences to influence offspring DNA methylation and gene expression in a manner that could alter development and inform novel prevention strategies.","[Pilkay, Stefanie R.] Syracuse Univ, Sch Social Work, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Combs-Orme, Terri] Univ Tennessee, Coll Social Work, Knoxville, TN USA; [Tylaysky, Ances] Univ Tennessee, Dept Prevent Med, Memphis, TN USA; [Bush, Nicole] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bush, Nicole] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pediat, San Francisco, CA USA; [Smith, Alicia K.] Emory Univ, Dept Gynecol & Obstet, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Pilkay, SR (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Sch Social Work, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",srpilkay@syr.edu,,,"Urban Child Institute; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; US National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [HD055462, HD060713]","Funding and support were provided by The Urban Child Institute and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, with other support from the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, grants HD055462 and HD060713.

We studied learning of fear toward innocuous gastrointestinal sensations as a putative mechanism in the development of gastrointestinal symptom-specific fear and anxiety. METHODS: Fifty-two healthy subjects (26 women) received 2 types of esophageal balloon distention at a perceptible but nonpainful intensity (conditioned stimulus [CS], the innocuous sensation) and at a painful intensity (unconditioned stimulus [US]). Subjects were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 groups. During the learning phase, the innocuous CS preceded the painful US in the experimental group (n = 26). In the control group (n = 26), on the contrary, the US never followed the CS directly. During a subsequent extinction phase, both groups received only CS distention-the painful US was no longer administered. Indexes of fear learning toward the innocuous CS distention included the skin conductance response, fear-potentiated startle (measured by the eye-blink electromyogram), and self-reported expectancy of the US. RESULTS: During the learning phase, only the experimental group learned to fear the innocuous gastrointestinal CS, based on the increase in US expectancy (compared with the control group, P = .04), increased skin conductance response (compared with the control group, P = .03), and potentiated startle reflex (compared with the control group, P = .001) in response to the CS. The differences between the experimental and control groups in US expectancy and skin conductance, but not fear-potentiated startle, disappeared during the extinction phase. CONCLUSIONS: Fear toward innocuous gastrointestinal sensations can be established through associative learning in healthy human beings. This may be an important mechanism in the development of fear of gastrointestinal symptoms, implicated in the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders.","[Ceunen, Erik; Zaman, Jonas; Arijs, Vicky; Vlaeyen, Johan W.

The present study examined the impact of acute stress and cortisol (CORT) on classically conditioned fear in men and women. Methods. Ninety-four healthy undergraduates were exposed to a mild stressor (or control condition) while subjective anxiety and glucocorticoid stress responses (salivary CORT) were measured. One hour later, all participants participated in a differential fear conditioning procedure while conditioned skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded. Results. Exposure to the stressor increased subjective anxiety and elevated CORT levels. In men, stress exposure facilitated fear conditioning; whereas in women, stress appeared to inhibit fear conditioning. The impact of stress on differential conditioning in men was associated with increased CORT levels. Conclusions. Consistent with animal models, these results demonstrate that stress exposure can modulate classical conditioning in humans, possibly via hormonal mechanisms. The enhancing effects of stress on the formation of conditioned fear might provide a useful model for the formation of pathological emotional reactions, such as those found in PTSD.","Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Anxiety Res Grp, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Jacobs, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Anxiety Res Grp, 1503 E Univ Blvd,Bldg 68, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",wjj@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,47,124,127,5,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

A standard reinstatement procedure in the laboratory involves a conditional stimulus (CS) paired with an unconditional stimulus (US) during acquisition (i.e., CS+), and a CS paired without an US (CS-) during acquisition. In extinction the CS + and CSare presented alone, then the US is presented without the CS in reinstatement, and followed by test trials of the CS. The current study examined whether reinstatement of fear can be triggered by a CS that was previously paired with the US (i.e., unextinguished CS) and reduced by extinction to the CSextinguished and CSunextinguished but not the CS- in a sample of first year psychology students (expectancy data N = 93; heart rate data N = 73). A differential aversive conditioning procedure presented within a virtual reality environment was used to examine reinstatement of the US expectancy and conditioned heart rate responses. As predicted, presentation of an unextinguished CS reinstated fear of a second previously extinguished CS. Moreover, conducting extinction with multiple stimuli attenuated this reinstatement of fear as indexed by self-report and heart rate measures. The present results suggest that therapy should include exposure to multiple stimuli to reduce the likelihood of reinstatement of fear.","[Krisch, Kirra A.; Bandarian-Balooch, Siavash; Neumann, David L.; Zhong, John] Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Bandarian-Balooch, Siavash] Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Southport, Qld, Australia",,"Krisch, KA (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",Kirra.Krisch@griffithuni.edu.au,"Neumann, David/AAD-7018-2020","Neumann, David/0000-0001-5400-462X",,,,63,1,1,1,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0023-9690,1095-9122,,LEARN MOTIV,Learn.

We tested the effects of environmental enrichments designed to increase the physical complexity of the cage and to provide opportunities for foraging behaviors on responses to novelty of young Orange-winged Amazon parrots (Amazona amazonica). Parrots (n = 16) were housed in either barren or enriched conditions for 1 year and responses to novel objects and human handlers were tested periodically. Parrots in the enriched condition had significantly shorter latencies to approach novel objects placed in their home cages than parrots from the control group (repeated measures GLM: F-1,F-13 = 8.00; P = 0.014). In addition, parrots from the enriched condition had shorter bouts of interaction (F-1,F-14 27.93; P < 0.0005) and spent significantly less time interacting with novel objects overall (F-1,F-14 27.93; P < 0.0005). Taken together, these results suggest that enrichment reduced both the fear response to novel objects and the motivation to explore and interact with those objects. When tested with a familiar handler, the control parrots had significantly higher response scores (i.e. they were less aggressive and more interactive) than the parrots from the enriched group (t-test; P < 0.005). This suggests that parrots housed in barren conditions may be more motivated to interact with familiar humans as a source of environmental stimulation. All parrots showed higher response scores to familiar than unfamiliar handlers, but in the control group there was a significant drop in score from the familiar to the unfamiliar handler (t-test; P < 0.0005) while in the enriched group the scores with familiar and unfamiliar handlers were similar. Thus, environmental enrichment reduced fear responses to both novel objects and unfamiliar human handlers. Factor analysis revealed that the responses to the novel object and novel human tests were independent, which implies that they did not measure the same underlying factor. Similarly, the factor analysis showed that enrichment independently decreased motivation to interact with novel objects and humans. Our results indicate that the enrichment protocol we employed can successfully modify both fear responses and motivation for environmental interaction in parrots and sheds light on the multi-factorial nature of both of these behavioral systems.

We addressed one emerging prediction, namely that experiencing fear in dreams is associated with more adapted responses to threatening signals during wakefulness. Using a stepwise approach across two studies, we identified brain regions activated when experiencing fear in dreams and showed that frightening dreams modulated the response of these same regions to threatening stimuli during wakefulness. Specifically, in Study 1, we performed serial awakenings in 18 participants recorded throughout the night with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and asked them whether they experienced any fear in their dreams. Insula and midcingulate cortex activity increased for dreams containing fear. In Study 2, we tested 89 participants and found that those reporting higher incidence of fear in their dreams showed reduced emotional arousal and fMRI response to fear-eliciting stimuli in the insula, amygdala and midcingulate cortex, while awake. Consistent with better emotion regulation processes, the same participants displayed increased medial prefrontal cortex activity. These findings support that emotions in dreams and wakefulness engage similar neural substrates, and substantiate a link between emotional processes occurring during sleep and emotional brain functions during wakefulness.","[Sterpenich, Virginie; Perogamvros, Lampros; Schwartz, Sophie] Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sterpenich, Virginie; Perogamvros, Lampros; Schwartz, Sophie] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Perogamvros, Lampros] Geneva Univ Hosp, Ctr Sleep Med, Dept Med, Div Pulmonol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Perogamvros, Lampros; Tononi, Giulio] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Wisconsin Inst Sleep & Consciousness, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Sterpenich, V; Perogamvros, L (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Fac Med, Dept Basic Neurosci, Geneva, Switzerland.",virginie.sterpenich@unige.ch; lampros.perogamvros@unige.ch,"Perogamvros, Lampros/AAC-4931-2019","Sterpenich, Virginie/0000-0002-2125-833X","NIH/NCCAMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine [P01AT004952]; NIH/NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [5P20MH077967]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [155120, 320030-159862, 51NF40-104897, 320030-135653]; Tiny Blue Dot Inc [MSN196438/AAC1335]","NIH/NCCAM, Grant/Award Number: P01AT004952; NIH/NIMH, Grant/Award Number: 5P20MH077967; Swiss National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: 155120, 320030-159862, 51NF40-104897, 320030-135653; Tiny Blue Dot Inc, Grant/Award Number: MSN196438/AAC1335",,94,9,9,3,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1065-9471,1097-0193,,HUM BRAIN MAPP,Hum.

The processes through which MDMA acts to enhance psychotherapy are not well understood. Given that fear memories contribute to PTSD symptomology, MDMA could augment psychotherapy by targeting fear memories. The current studies investigated the effects of a single administration of MDMA on extinction and reconsolidation of cued and contextual fear memory in adult, male Long-Evans rats. Rats were exposed to contextual or auditory fear conditioning followed by systemic administration of saline or varying doses of MDMA (between 1 and 10 mg/kg) either 30 min before fear extinction training or immediately after brief fear memory retrieval (i.e. during the reconsolidation phase). MDMA administered prior to fear extinction training failed to enhance fear extinction memory, and in fact impaired drug free cued fear extinction recall without impacting later fear relapse. MDMA administered during the re consolidation phase, but not outside of the reconsolidation phase, produced a delayed and persistent reduction in conditioned fear. These findings are consistent with a general memory-disrupting effect of MDMA and suggest that MDMA could augment psychotherapy by modifying fear memories during reconsolidation without necessarily enhancing their extinction.","[Hake, Holly S.; Davis, Jazmyne K.

The risk assessment process is becoming a powerful tool to provide sound scientific bases for decision-making processes. In Portugal, the risk assessment process is in its early years and the lack of multidisciplinary teams of experts is frequently mentioned as the main obstacle to its implementation. Therefore, the majority of the reclamation actions are based on impact assessment studies that usually are characterized by few biological and toxicological considerations. In order to account for some of these constraints, the ecological risk assessment framework proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was used to plan the assessment of human and ecological risks posed by the high concentrations of metals scattered in the vicinity of S. Domingos mine, a cuprous pyrite mine located in the Southeast Alentejo (Portugal). This study presents the problem formulation phase of the assessment. It includes all the scientific information available for the area, a conceptual model, and an analysis plan for the risk assessment process. Following a tiered approach, several tasks were planned in order to acquire chemical, toxicological, and ecological information, in order to compensate for the lack of toxicity data for site-specific species.","Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; Inst Piaget, Viseu, Portugal; Univ Coimbra, Dept Zool, Coimbra, Portugal",,"Pereira, R (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",ruthp@bio.ua.pt,"Pereira, Ruth/AAY-3535-2021; Ribeiro, Rui/C-7788-2012; Gonalves, Fernando J.

However, generalization may also extend beyond the perceptual discrimination threshold, ostensibly due to contributions from processes other than perception. Currently the neural mechanisms that mediate perceptual and non-perceptual aspects of fear generalization are unclear. To investigate this question, we conducted a Pavlovian fear conditioning and generalization experiment, collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), skin conductance and explicit shock likelihood ratings, in 37 healthy subjects. Face stimuli were initially paired (CS+) or not paired (CS) with an electrical shock. During the generalization phase, responses were measured to the CS+, CS and a range of CS +-to CS morphs (generalization stimuli), selected for each participant based on that participant's discrimination ability. Across multiple measurements, we found that fear generalization responses were limited to stimuli that could not be distinguished from the CS + stimulus, thus following a gradient closely linked to perceptual discriminability. These measurements, which were correlated with one another, included skin conductance responses, behavioral ratings, and fMRI responses of anterior insula and superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, responses in areas of the default network, including the posterior cingulate gyrus, angular gyrus and hippocampus, showed a negative generalization function extending to stimuli that were more likely to be distinguished from the CS+. In addition, the generalization gradients of the anterior insula and the behavioral ratings showed some evidence for extension beyond perceptual limits. Taken together, these results suggest that distinct brain areas are involved in perceptual and non-perceptual components of fear generalization.","[Tuominen, Lauri; Boeke, Emily; DeCross, Stephanie; Wolthusen, Rick P.

For interaction, the related technique of perception, cognition and interaction are briefly introduced. For ethics, rules should be given for the robot designers to include ethics for certain application while risks should be evaluated during the experiment test. To make efficient decision, safety design with AI technology should be put on agenda for roboticists. Except from the risks, ethics raise many challenges while most of them can be solved by developing technologies while some of the problems exist in human's society which also raise the questions for the human beings.

Despite being widely adopted as a model system for stress and anxiety disorders, fear-conditioning research has not yet char-acterized how threat proximity impacts the mechanisms of fear acquisition and extinction in the human brain. We used three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality technology to manipulate the ego-centric distance of conspecific threats while healthy adult partici-pants navigated virtual worlds during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Consistent with theoretical predictions, proximal threats enhanced fear acquisition by shifting conditioned learning from cognitive to reactive fear circuits in the brain and reducing amygdala-cortical connectivity during both fear acquisi-tion and extinction. With an analysis of representational pattern similarity between the acquisition and extinction phases, we fur-ther demonstrate that proximal threats impaired extinction effi-cacy via persistent multivariate representations of conditioned learning in the cerebellum, which predicted susceptibility to later fear reinstatement. These results show that conditioned threats encountered in close proximity are more resistant to extinction learning and suggest that the canonical neural circuitry typically associated with fear learning requires additional consideration of a more reactive neural fear system to fully account for this effect.","[Faul, Leonard; Stjepanovic, Daniel; Stivers, Joshua M.; Stewart, Gregory W.; Graner, John L.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Stjepanovic, Daniel] Univ Queensland, Ctr Youth Subst Abuse Res, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Morey, Rajendra A.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,"LaBar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.; LaBar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Med Ctr, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",klabar@duke.edu,"Stjepanovic, Daniel/B-3658-2009","Stjepanovic, Daniel/0000-0003-4307-423X; Stewart, Gregory/0000-0001-8446-2322",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 1460909],We thank Bao Doan for assistance with development of the virtual reality simulation in Unity.

However, it is possible that the expression of other behaviors may compete with freezing, particularly in rodent populations that have not been thoroughly studied in this context. Rearing and grooming are complex behaviors that are frequently exhibited by mice during fear conditioning. Both behaviors have been shown to be stress-sensitive, and the expression of these behaviors is dependent upon strain background. To better understand how genetic background impacts behavioral responses during fear conditioning, we examined freezing, rearing, and grooming frequencies prior to fear conditioning training and across different stages of fear conditioning testing in male mice from eight inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, SWR/J, BTBR T + ltpr3Tf/J, SM/J, LP/ J, 129S1/SvlmJ) that exhibited diverse freezing responses. We found that genetic background determined rearing and grooming expression throughout fear conditioning, and their patterns of expression across stages of fear conditioning were strain dependent. Using publicly available SNP data, we found that polymorphisms in Dab1, a gene that is implicated in both grooming and learning phenotypes, separated the strains with high contextual grooming from the others using a hierarchical clustering analysis. This suggested a potential genetic mechanism for the observed behavioral differences. These findings demonstrate that genetic background determines behavioral responses during fear conditioning and suggest that shared genetic substrates underlie fear conditioning behaviors.","[Seemiller, L.

However, extinction is highly context-sensitive, resulting in the renewal of fear after shifts in context and limiting the clinical efficacy of extinction training. Lesion and inactivation studies have shown that the contextualization of extinction depends on the hippocampus. Parallel studies have found that intrahippocampal scopolamine (Scop) blocks contextual fear conditioning. Importantly, this effect was replicated with a noninvasive technique in which a low dose of Scop was administered systemically. We aimed to transfer the effects of this noninvasive approach to block the contextualization of fear extinction. Methods: Rats were tone fear conditioned and extinguished under various systemic doses of Scop or the saline vehicle. They were subsequently tested (off drug) for tone fear in a context that was the same (control subjects) or shifted (renewal group) with respect to the extinction context. Results: The lowest dose of Scop produced a significant attenuation of fear renewal when renewal was tested either in the original training context or a novel context. The drug also slowed the rate of long-term extinction memory formation, which was readily overcome by extending extinction training. Scopolamine only gave this effect when it was administered during but not after extinction training. Higher doses of Scop severely disrupted extinction learning. Conclusions: We discovered that disrupting contextual processing during extinction with the cholinergic antagonist Scop blocked subsequent fear renewal.

Methods: This economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial among 540 community-living adults in the Netherlands, aged 70 years and older who reported fear of falling and fear-induced activity avoidance. The participants allocated to the intervention group received a multicomponent cognitive behavioral group intervention consisting of eight weekly sessions and a booster session. The sessions were aimed at instilling realistic views of falls, reducing fall risk, and increasing activity and safe behavior. Participants in the control group received usual care. Cost outcome measures were healthcare costs, and patient and family costs. Clinical outcomes were fear of falling and activity avoidance. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2, 8, and 14 months by means of registration forms, self-administered questionnaires, and interviews by telephone. Results: Participants were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 280) and control groups (n = 260). Costs for the intervention program were on average (sic)276 per person. Total costs per person were comparable ((sic)4,925 in intervention group and (sic)4,828 in control group). Furthermore, favorable effects of the program were observed for fear of falling and activity avoidance. Conclusions: This study showed that the intervention program is preferable to usual care in terms of costs and effects. The program had comparable costs and significantly reduced fear of falling and associated activity avoidance among older community-living persons.","[van Haastregt, Jolanda C. M.; Zijlstra, G. A.

Effective treatment for fear-based pathology depends on understanding how fear is learned and regulated. Among the molecular systems required for fear learning and amygdalar synaptic plasticity, brain derived neurtrophic factor (BDNF) and its high affinity receptor Ntrk2/TrkB have been shown to play essential roles. Therefore, we will focus this review on three main aspects; first of all, the impact of Bdnf polymorphism on fear related characteristics in humans and animal models. Secondly, we will discuss BDNF-TrkB activity regulation by epigenetic, transcriptional and post-translational events, and finally we will discuss TrkB-BDNF signalling in fear learning. BDNF-TrkB and the signalling activated in this particular form of plasticity are becoming crucial players in fear learning and memory thus highlighting these molecules as potential therapeutic targets in fear-related pathologies.","[Minichiello, Liliana] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Neuroregenerat, Edinburgh EH16 4SB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Musumeci, Grabiele] Fdn Santa Lucia, Inst Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, I-00179 Rome, Italy",,"Minichiello, L (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Neuroregenerat, Edinburgh EH16 4SB, Midlothian, Scotland.",liliana.minichiello@ed.ac.uk,"Minichiello, Liliana/AAA-7190-2022",,,,,175,34,35,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0334-1763,1607-8470,,REV NEUROSCIENCE,Rev.

It is difficult for contemporary readers to understand how fear of anything can be virtuous. I propose that the fear of the Lord should be understood as accountability to God. I defend the claim that someone who displays excellence in an accountability relationship does display a virtue, and that this virtue is particularly valuable when exercised in relation to God. If we reject an individualistic view of moral motivation inspired by Kant, we can see that being held accountable does not necessarily diminish personal autonomy. The primary motivation for the person who has the virtue of accountability is not fear of punishment, but a desire to do what is right because it is right, rooted in an appreciation of the standing of one to whom one is accountable.","[Evans, C.

This increased fear load associated with PTSD can be a barrier to effective therapy thus indicating the need for new treatments to reduce fear expression in people with PTSD. One potential biological target for reducing fear expression in PTSD is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is dysregulated in PTSD. Recent translational rodent studies and cross-sectional clinical studies have shown that dexamethasone administration and the resulting suppression of cortisol in individuals with PTSD leads to a decrease in the fear responses characteristic of PTSD. These data, taken together, suggest that dexamethasone may serve as a novel pharmacologic intervention for heightened fear responses in PTSD. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test our hypothesis that dexamethasone administration and the concomitant suppression of HPA axis hyperactivity would attenuate fear expression and enhance fear extinction in individuals with PTSD. Study participants (n = 62) were recruited from Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, GA. Participants were randomized to receive dexamethasone or placebo prior to fear conditioning and extinction, in a counterbalanced design (treatments separated by a week). Both PTSD- (n = 37) and PTSD + (n = 25) participants showed significant startle increases in the presence of the danger signal during placebo and dexamethasone treatments (all p < 0.05). However, only PTSD- control participants showed decreases in fear-potentiated startle across extinction blocks during both conditions (p's <= 0.001), with PTSD + participants showing deficits in fear extinction and safety discrimination in the placebo condition. Notably, extinction and discrimination deficits in PTSD + subjects were markedly reversed with dexamethasone (p < 0.001). These data suggest that dexamethasone may serve as a pharmacological agent with which to facilitate fear extinction and discrimination in individuals with PTSD.","[Michopoulos, Vasiliki; Norrholm, Seth D.; Stevens, Jennifer S.; Rothbaum, Barbara O.; Gillespie, Charles F.; Schwartz, Ann C.; Ressler, Kerry J.; Jovanovic, Tanja] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 49 Jesse Hill Jr NE, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Michopoulos, Vasiliki] Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.] Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line, Decatur, GA USA; [Glover, Ebony M.] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Psychol, Kennesaw, GA USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.] Harvard McLean Hosp, Boston, MA USA",,"Jovanovic, T (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 49 Jesse Hill Jr NE, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",tjovano@emory.edu,"Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022; Michopoulos, Vasiliki/C-7342-2014; Stevens, Jennifer/T-4290-2018; Gillespie, Charles F/G-8481-2012","Michopoulos, Vasiliki/0000-0003-2531-923X; Stevens, Jennifer/0000-0003-4674-0314; Gillespie, Charles F/0000-0001-5476-5920","Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; National Institute for Health [R01 MH094757, R21 MH092576]; National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [K12 HD085850]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation; Emory and Grady Memorial Hospital General Clinical Research Center (GCRC); NIH National Centers for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [M01 RR00039]; Burroughs Wellcome FundBurroughs Wellcome Fund; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [K12HD085850] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [M01RR000039] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH071537, R01MH110364, R21MH092576, R01MH094757] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Institute for Health (R01 MH094757, KJR; R21 MH092576 TJ), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (K12 HD085850, VM) and the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation.

Pain continues to be an important public health concern, especially given the opioid crisis in industrialized countries. It is important to understand the association between emotions such as fear and anxiety and the experience of pain as both a physiological and affective experience. Fear or anxiety about pain is in fact a well-known predictor of and close associate of pain. Nociception and pain history differ depending on age, yet little empirical evidence exists on how fear of pain varies over the life span. The purpose of this study was to provide a cross-sectional examination of the relations between age and fear of pain across the adult life span. Methods. Using cross-sectional data from 4,122 participants who completed the Fear of Pain Questionnaire-9, structural equation modeling and regression techniques were used to examine the association between fear of pain and age. Results. A positive linear association was discovered between age and fear of severe or minor pain, and a negative association was discovered between age and fear of medical or dental pain. Quadratic and cubic relations were also significant for fear of severe pain, fear of medical and dental pain, and overall fear of pain, but not for fear of minor pain. Conclusions. Unique trajectories for different components of pain-related fear exist across the adult life span and may be affected by increased exposure to medical and dental experiences over time and by the awareness of a greater likelihood of experiencing pain later in the life span.","[Wright, Casey D.; McNeil, Daniel W.] West Virginia Univ, Eberly Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, 53 Campus Dr,POB 6040, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [McNeil, Daniel W.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Dent Practice & Rural Hlth, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",,"Wright, CD (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Eberly Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, 53 Campus Dr,POB 6040, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",cdw0022@mix.wvu.edu; dmcneil@wvu.edu,,,"National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [NIGMS T32-GM081741]; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [NIDCR F31-DE027859, R01-DE014889, R21-DE026540]","Financial and material support included the authors being funded in part by grants from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS T32-GM081741) and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ( NIDCR F31-DE027859, R01-DE014889, and R21-DE026540).",,40,0,0,1,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1526-2375,1526-4637,,PAIN MED,Pain Med.,MAR,2021,22,3,,,,,567,576,,10.1093/pm/pnaa390,,JAN 2021,10,"Anesthesiology; Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Anesthesiology; General & Internal Medicine,RJ0VZ,WOS:000637323000005,33404654,Green Published,,,2022-04-16,

In humans and rodents alike, reactivated fear memories can be attenuated by disrupting reconsolidation with extinction training. Using functional brain imaging, we found that, after a conditioned fear memory was formed, reactivation and reconsolidation left a memory trace in the basolateral amygdala that predicted subsequent fear expression and was tightly coupled to activity in the fear circuit of the brain. In contrast, reactivation followed by disrupted reconsolidation suppressed fear, abolished the memory trace, and attenuated fear-circuit connectivity. Thus, as previously demonstrated in rodents, fear memory suppression resulting from behavioral disruption of reconsolidation is amygdala-dependent also in humans, which supports an evolutionarily conserved memory-update mechanism.","[Agren, Thomas; Engman, Jonas; Frick, Andreas; Bjorkstrand, Johannes; Furmark, Tomas; Fredrikson, Mats] Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, SE-75142 Uppsala, Sweden; [Larsson, Elna-Marie] Uppsala Univ, Dept Radiol Oncol & Radiat Sci, SE-75142 Uppsala, Sweden",,"Agren, T (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, SE-75142 Uppsala, Sweden.",thomas.agren@psyk.uu.se,"Agren, Thomas/AAC-4901-2022; Frick, Andreas/D-1882-2015","Frick, Andreas/0000-0003-2516-9075; Furmark, Tomas/0000-0001-6821-9058",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Heumanska stiftelsen; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social ResearchSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte),"We thank the Swedish Research Council, Heumanska stiftelsen, and the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research for support.",,23,203,214,0,116,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,,,SCIENCE,Science,SEP 21,2012,337,6101,,,,,1550,1552,,10.1126/science.1223006,,,3,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,007UC,WOS:000308912900054,22997340,,,,2022-04-16,

Between April 30(th), 2020 and May 28(th), 2020, we evaluated self-reported changes in recent smoking patterns and motivation to quit smoking among current daily cigarette smokers (N = 103) on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We also assessed the relationship of these outcomes to age, medical comorbidity status, and fear of COVID-19. Most participants (68.9%) reported smoking less frequently than usual in the last 28 days. Among daily smokers, increased fear of COVID-19 predicted increased motivation to quit smoking and actual smoking reductions (ps < .05). Endorsement of one or more medical comorbidities, but not increased age, predicted increased motivation to quit smoking (p < .05). These data suggest the potentially greater relevance of psychological factors (e.g., fear of COVID-19) over external risk factors (e.g., medical comorbidity, increased age) on motivation to quit smoking and actual reductions in smoking patterns, and may reflect that the pandemic is a suitable time for offering smoking cessation intervention.","[Gold, Alexandra K.; Hoyt, Danielle L.; Milligan, Megan; Hiserodt, Michele L.; Samora, Jake; Otto, Michael W.] Boston Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 900 Commonwealth Ave,2nd Floor, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Leyro, Teresa M.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Zvolensky, Michael J.] Univ Houston, Dept Psychol, Houston, TX USA; [Zvolensky, Michael J.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,"Gold, AK (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 900 Commonwealth Ave,2nd Floor, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",akgold@bu.edu,,"Samora, Jake/0000-0002-9035-7999; Milligan, Megan/0000-0001-8799-0665; Leyro, Teresa/0000-0002-2321-6272; Hiserodt, Michele/0000-0002-7381-3454; Hoyt, Danielle/0000-0002-8573-7575",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F31MH116557]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) Science of Behavior Change Common Fund ProgramUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R21 DA046963]; National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [NIH R34 DA043751],"Ms. Gold's effort on this project was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health [F31MH116557].

Although predator attacks on humans are rare, they create lasting media attention, and the way the media covers them might affect people's risk perception. Understanding how mass media presents attacks and how this can affect perception will provide insights into potential strategies to improve coexistence with these species. We collected media reports of predator attacks on humans and examined their content. Almost half (41.5%) of the analyzed reports contained graphic elements. Differences in framing between species groups or species were found, with sharks and leopards having the highest proportion of graphic reports, whereas canids and bears had the highest number of neutral reports. This bias in coverage, instead of providing insights into the causes of these incidents and possible remedies, may provoke fear and decrease support for predator conservation.","[Bombieri, Giulia; Del Mar Delgado, Maria; Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose; Penteriani, Vincenzo] Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers, UMIB, UO CSIC PA, Mieres, Spain; [Bombieri, Giulia; Penteriani, Vincenzo] Museo Sci, Sez Zool Vertebrati, Trento, Italy; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] Pyrenean Inst Ecol, Zaragoza, Spain; [Nanni, Veronica] Univ Genoa, DiSTAV, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Vita, Genoa, Italy; [Fedriani, Jose M.] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves CEABN, Lisbon, Portugal; [Fedriani, Jose M.] Univ Lisbon, InBIO, Inst Agron, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Bombieri, G (corresponding author), Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers, UMIB, UO CSIC PA, Mieres, Spain.",giulipan91@gmail.com; penteriani@ipe.csic.es,"Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018; Nanni, Veronica/AAK-1194-2021; Bombieri, Giulia/W-9305-2019","Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Nanni, Veronica/0000-0001-6379-7764; Delgado, Maria del Mar/0000-0002-3009-738X","Museo delle Scienze di Trento (Muse), Italy; Spanish Ramon y Cajal contract [RYC-2014-16263]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, MINECO [CGL2017-82782-P]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional of the European Union","We gratefully acknowledge the very helpful comments of the three anonymous reviewers.

We fear-conditioned 100 Long-Evans rats, attempted to extinguish fear the next day, and tested extinction recall on the third day. The distribution of freezing scores after fear conditioning was skewed, with most rats showing substantial freezing; after fear extinction, the distribution was bimodal with most rats showing minimal freezing, but a substantial portion showing maximal freezing. Longer rearing episodes measured prior to conditioning predicted less freezing at the beginning of extinction, but differences in extinction learning were not predicted by any baseline exploratory behaviors. We tested the heritability of extinction differences by breeding rats from the top and bottom 20 % of freezing scores during extinction recall. We then ran the offspring through the same conditioning/extinction procedure, with the addition of recording ultrasonic vocalizations throughout training and testing. Only a minority of rats emitted distress vocalizations during fear acquisition, but the incidence was less frequent in the offspring of good extinguishers than in poor extinguishers or randomly bred controls. The occurrence of distress vocalizations during acquisition predicted higher levels of freezing during fear recall regardless of breeding line, but the relationship between vocalization and freezing was no longer evident following extinction training, at which point freezing levels were influenced only by breeding and not by vocalization. The heritability (h (2)) of extinction recall was estimated at 0.36, consistent with human estimates.","[Shumake, Jason; Furgeson-Moreira, Sergio; Monfils, Marie H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Shumake, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, 108 E Dean Keeton Stop A8000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",shumake@utexas.edu,"Shumake, Jason/AAP-3506-2020","Shumake, Jason/0000-0003-4655-436X; Monfils, Marie-H./0000-0001-8971-6651","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1R21MH086805, 1R01MH091147]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH086805, R01MH091147] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Elizabeth Chen, David Song, and Lizzy Robinson for their assistance in scoring freezing videos and processing spectrograms.

Men and women seem to differ in their capability to learn and retrieve fear and extinction memories. This review outlines how sex may influence human fear conditioning, with an emphasis on the sex hormones and oral contraceptives. Available evidence suggests women with high estrogen levels to acquire fear more readily, but also to extinguish fear more easily, leading to an enhanced extinction memory trace. By contrast, women with low estrogens (e.g. due to oral contraceptives) seem to show deficits in extinction recall. These findings are highly relevant for future basic and applied studies alike.","[Merz, Christian J.; Kinner, Valerie L.; Wolf, Oliver T.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany",,"Wolf, OT (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",oliver.t.wolf@rub.de,,"Wolf, Oliver T./0000-0002-9320-2124; Merz, Christian/0000-0001-5679-6595; Jentsch, Valerie L./0000-0001-9318-9540","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 1280, A09]","This work was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG; SFB 1280 Extinction Learning; project A09 to CJM and OTW).

Little is known, however, about the analogous impacts of humans as perceived top predators on the foraging behaviour of carnivores. Here, we investigate the influence of human-induced fear on puma foraging behaviour using location and prey consumption data from 30 tagged individuals living along a gradient of human development. We observed strong behavioural responses by female pumas to human development, whereby their fidelity to kill sites and overall consumption time of prey declined with increasing housing density by 36 and 42%, respectively. Females responded to this decline in prey consumption time by increasing the number of deer they killed in high housing density areas by 36% over what they killed in areas with little residential development. The loss of food from declines in prey consumption time paired with increases in energetic costs associated with killing more prey may have consequences for puma populations, particularly with regard to reproductive success. In addition, greater carcass availability is likely to alter community dynamics by augmenting food resources for scavengers. In light of the extensive and growing impact of habitat modification, our study emphasizes that knowledge of the indirect effects of human activity on animal behaviour is a necessary component in understanding anthropogenic impacts on community dynamics and food web function.","[Smith, Justine A.; Wang, Yiwei; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Smith, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jsmith5@ucsc.edu,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0963022, 1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Nature Conservancy; Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District; UC Santa Cruz; Felidae Conservation Fund; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0963022] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Funding was provided by NSF grant nos. 0963022 and 1255913, as well as by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, UC Santa Cruz and the Felidae Conservation Fund.",,31,85,85,4,83,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The approach supports the integration of the human behaviour of the workers aiming to assess the risks arising from human misbehaviour in the man-machine interaction. Modifying the well-known house of quality, the basic design tool of the management approach known as Quality Function Deployment (QFD), the risk priority number (RPN) of the risks due to the human misbehaviour and their inter-correlated domino effects are evaluated considering the severity, detectability and occurrence criteria that are weighted using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Thereafter, the safety protective devices, that are most effective to manage the risks due to the human behaviour in the man-machine interaction, are selected on the basis of the RPN and their correlated effectiveness. The proposed approach is applied to an ordinary maintenance activity on a fruit and vegetable hot refiner. The effectiveness and usefulness of the original methodology for the selection of the most effective technical solutions to mitigate the risks due to the human misbehaviour are presented in the provided case study.","[Braglia, Marcello; Gabbrielli, Roberto; Marrazzini, Leonardo] Univ Pisa, Dept Civil & Ind Engn, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Di Donato, Luciano] Natl Inst Insurance Accid Work INAIL, DIT Dept Technol Innovat & Safety Plants Prod & A, Via Roberto Ferruzzi 38, I-000143 Rome, Italy",,"Gabbrielli, R (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Civil & Ind Engn, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",m.braglia@ing.unipi.it; l.didonato@inail.it; r.gabbrielli@ing.unipi.it,"Marrazzini, Leonardo/Y-4770-2019","Marrazzini, Leonardo/0000-0002-6793-7813; Di Donato, Luciano/0000-0001-8290-0456",Istituto nazionale Assicurazione Infortuni sul Lavoro (INAIL) (Italy) through the fund Bando Ricerche in Collaborazione (BRiC) - Procedura valutativa per l'affidamento di collaborazioni a titolo oneroso alle attivita di ricerca dell'INAIL.

The aim of this study was to determine if repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) facilitates fear extinction in rats, especially when paired with exposure to a conditioned stimulus (CS). Thirty-five rats were conditioned to a tone CS by pairing the tone with an electric foot shock as an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). We assessed the effects of 10 Hz rTMS before fear extinction (experiment 1) and rTMS paired with CS during extinction (experiment 2) on the following day. Fear responses of the rats were estimated using the level of freezing upon tone stimulus and were compared between the rTMS and corresponding sham groups. The rats treated with rTMS before fear extinction showed no difference in freezing time when compared with the sham group. However, the rats treated with rTMS paired with CS during extinction showed significantly less freezing behavior than the sham group, and this enhancement of fear extinction remained after 24 h without further stimulation. This finding suggests that high-frequency rTMS paired with trauma-reminding stimuli enhances fear extinction and that rTMS in conjunction with exposure therapy is potentially useful for facilitating extinction memory in the treatment of PTSD.

However, questions have been raised as to whether this latter type of research is ethical, or can be performed in an ethical manner. Under what circumstances is it acceptable to intentionally expose human subjects to potentially toxic agents?

Among other important predictors, fear of pain has been shown to be a critical component of dental fear. While learning history (id est, past experience) is known to shape development and maintenance of dental fear and fear of pain, minimal work has addressed genetic etiological variables for these healthcarerelated anxieties. With the aim of coming to a more complete conceptualization of dental fear, this study assessed the heritability of dental fear and fear of pain and elucidated the role of genetics in the relation between the constructs. Methods: Participants (n = 1370; 827 female), aged 11-74 years (M = 29.2, SD = 12.2), in a family-based cohort study completed measures of dental fear and fear of pain. Heritability and genetic correlation were estimated using likelihood-based methods under the variance components framework. Results: Dental fear was 30% heritable (P < 0.001) and fear of pain was 34% heritable (P < 0.001). Notably, there was substantial genetic correlation between dental fear and fear of pain, qG = 0.67, suggesting they are genetically related, but likely are distinct phenotypes. Conclusions: It is clear that, in addition to environmental factors, genetic influences are important in the etiology of dental fear and anxiety and should be considered in future studies of fear and anxiety associated with dental treatment and, potentially, interventions aimed at reducing distress that is a barrier to dental treatment utilization.","[Randall, Cameron L.] West Virginia Univ, Eberly Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, Morgantown, WV USA; [Randall, Cameron L.; McNeil, Daniel W.; Crout, Richard J.; Weyant, Robert J.; Marazita, Mary L.] Ctr Oral Hlth Res Appalachia, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Shaffer, John R.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Human Genet, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [McNeil, Daniel W.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Psychol, Box 6040, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [McNeil, Daniel W.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Dent Practice & Rural Hlth, Morgantown, WV USA; [Crout, Richard J.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Periodont, Sch Dent, Morgantown, WV USA; [Weyant, Robert J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Dent Med, Dept Dent Publ Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Marazita, Mary L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Craniofacial & Dent Genet, Dept Oral Biol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Marazita, Mary L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Craniofacial & Dent Genet, Dept Human Genet, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Marazita, Mary L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Craniofacial & Dent Genet, Dept Clin & Translat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Randall, CL; McNeil, DW (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Psychol, Box 6040, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.; Shaffer, JR (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Human Genet, 130 De Soto St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",CRANDAL1@mix.wvu.edu; jrs51@pitt.edu; dmcneil@wvu.edu,,"Weyant, Robert/0000-0002-5252-9120","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [R01-DE014899, F31-DE023493]; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32-GM081741]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [R01DE014899, F31DE023493] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM081741] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors acknowledge with gratitude the families participating in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia, cohort 1 (COHRA1), Study on Determinants of Oral health in families.

A virtual environment might prove to be the ideal tool for innovative experimental paradigms to study explicitly cued fear and contextual anxiety in humans. Methods: Subjects were guided through a virtual environment that consisted of two rooms connected by a street scene. In each of the rooms, a blue and a yellow panel on a wall served as explicit conditioned stimuli (CS). The panels; were displayed several times. One of the panels (CS+) was associated with a shock in one of the rooms (shock room). No shock was administered in the other room (safe room). Acoustic startle stimuli were administered in. the presence and in the absence of the panels to assess explicit cued conditioning to the CS and context conditioning to the rooms, respectively. Results: Startle was potentiated by the CS+ in both rooms, which suggests generalization of fear across contexts. After acquisition, startle was potentiated in the shock room, compared with the safe room, in the absence of the CS+. Conclusions: These results support the future use of virtual reality to design new conditioning experiments to study both fear and anxiety.","NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, US Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, US Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 15K North Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 113,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",,"Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019; Lissek, Shmuel/B-6577-2008","Lissek, Shmuel/0000-0001-7384-371X; Baas, Johanna/0000-0001-6267-8712","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002780, Z01MH002780, ZIAMH002782, Z01MH002782] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,19,77,77,5,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

This project compared the intensity of fear produced by experimental messages with that produced by adverse events, such as wars and hurricanes. Results showed that threat appeals (k = 80; N = 6,738; Delta = 2.15) have been effective at inducing levels of fear that are on par with the fear induced by real-world occurrences (k = 19, N = 4,928,Delta = 2.01). Thus, the positive, linear association between threat (X) and persuasion (Y) observed in previous meta-analyses is probably an accurate characterization of the X-Y association: a finding that is inconsistent with inverted-U theories. The distribution of fear values produced by the experimental messages provides empirical benchmarks for future research.","[Dillard, James Price; Li, Shu Scott] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Dillard, JP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jpd16@psu.edu,,"Dillard, James/0000-0001-8109-1562",,,,56,3,3,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0360-3989,1468-2958,,HUM COMMUN RES,Hum.

Therefore, understanding neural substrates of fear extinction is imperative for developing more effective therapies for anxiety and stress disorders. Although several studies indicated a role for cholinergic transmission and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in anxiety and stress disorder symptomatology, very little is known about the specific contribution of nAChRs in the fear extinction process. In the present study, we first examined the involvement of several brain regions essential for fear extinction (i.e., dorsal and ventral hippocampus, dHPC and vHPC; infralimbic, IL, and prelimbic, PL of the medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC; basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, BLA) in the impairing effects of a nAChR agonist, nicotine, on contextual fear extinction in mice. Our results showed that systemic administration of nicotine during contextual fear extinction increased c-fos expression in the vHPC and BLA while not affecting dHPC, IL or PL. In line with these results, local nicotine infusions into the vHPC, but not dHPC, resulted in impaired contextual fear extinction. Interestingly, we found that local nicotine infusions into the PL also resulted in impairment of contextual fear extinction. Second, we measured the protein levels of the GABA synthesizing enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 in the dHPC and vHPC during contextual fear extinction. Our results showed that in the group that received acute nicotine, both GAD65 and GAD67 protein levels were downregulated in the vHPC, but not in dHPC. This effect was negatively correlated with the level of freezing response during fear extinction suggesting that the downregulated GAD65/67 levels were associated with disrupted fear extinction. Finally, using c-fos/GAD65/67 double immunofluorescence, we showed that nicotine mainly increased c-fos expression in non-GABAergic ventral hippocampal cells, indicating that acute nicotine increases vHPC excitability. Overall, our results suggest that acute nicotine's impairing effects on fear extinction are associated with ventral hippocampal disinhibition. Therefore, these results further our understanding of the interaction between nicotine addiction and anxiety and stress disorders by describing novel neural mechanisms mediating fear extinction.","[Kutlu, Munir Gunes; Cann, Courtney; Gould, Thomas J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biobehav Hlth, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Connor, David A.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tumolo, Jessica M.; Garrett, Brendan] Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,"Kutlu, MG (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, 865 Light Hall, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",gunes.kutlu@vanderbilt.edu,,,"National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [DA017949, 1U01DA041632]; Jean Phillips Shibley Endowment; Penn State Biobehavioral Health Department; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [U01DA041632, R01DA017949] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was funded with grant support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (T.J.G., DA017949; 1U01DA041632), Jean Phillips Shibley Endowment, and Penn State Biobehavioral Health Department.

Emerging findings from our laboratory and others are consistent with the novel hypothesis that obese individuals may be predisposed to developing PTSD. Given that aberrant fear responses are pivotal in the pathogenesis of PTSD, the objective of this study was to determine the impact of an obesogenic Western-like high-fat diet (WD) on neural substrates associated with fear. Methods: Adolescent Lewis rats (n = 72) were fed with either the experimental WD (41.4% kcal from fat) or the control diet. The fear-potentiated startle paradigm was used to determine sustained and phasic fear responses. Diffusion tensor imaging metrics and T2 relaxation times were used to determine the structural integrity of the fear circuitry including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). Results: The rats that consumed the WD exhibited attenuated fear learning and fear extinction. These behavioral impairments were associated with oversaturation of the fear circuitry and astrogliosis. The BLA T2 relaxation times were significantly decreased in the WD rats relative to the controls. We found elevated fractional anisotropy in the mPFC of the rats that consumed the WD. We show that consumption of a WD may lead to long-lasting damage to components of the fear circuitry. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that consumption of an obesogenic diet during adolescence has a profound impact in the maturation of the fear neurocircuitry. The implications of this research are significant as they identify potential biomarkers of risk for psychopathology in the growing obese population. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It is influenced by factors in the physical and social environment. This study aimed to review and synthesize qualitative evidence from the UK on fear of crime and the environment. Methods: Eighteen databases were searched, including crime, health and social science databases. Qualitative studies conducted in the UK which presented data on fear of crime and the environment were included. Quality was assessed using Hawker et al.'s framework. Data were synthesized thematically. Results: A total of 40 studies were included in the review. Several factors in the physical environment are perceived to impact on fear of crime, including visibility and signs of neglect. However, factors in the local social environment appear to be more important as drivers of fear of crime, including social networks and familiarity. Broader social factors appear to be of limited relevance. There is considerable evidence for limitations on physical activity as a result of fear of crime, but less for mental health impacts. Conclusions: Fear of crime represents a complex set of responses to the environment. It may play a role in mediating environmental impacts on health and wellbeing.","[Lorenc, Theo; Petticrew, Mark; Cummins, Steven] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Social & Environm Hlth Res, London WC1, England; [Whitehead, Margaret; Neary, David; Clayton, Stephen] Univ Liverpool, Dept Publ Hlth & Policy, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Wright, Kath; Sowden, Amanda] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Thomson, Hilary] MRC, Social & Publ Hlth Sci Unit, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Renton, Adrian] Univ E London, Inst Hlth & Human Dev, London E15 4LZ, England",,"Lorenc, T (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Social & Environm Hlth Res, London WC1, England.",theo.lorenc@lshtm.ac.uk,"Wright, Kath/P-1516-2019; Cummins, Steven/C-1230-2009; Clayton, Stephen/AAD-6360-2020; Petticrew, Mark/AAY-6274-2021","Cummins, Steven/0000-0002-3957-4357; Clayton, Stephen/0000-0003-2823-1495","National Institute of Health ResearchNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [09/3000/14]; National Institute for Health ResearchNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [SRF-2010-03-05, 09/3000/14] Funding Source: researchfish","This project was funded by the National Institute of Health Research (grant number 09/3000/14).

However both in animal and human studies the retrieval cue typically involves a re-exposure to the original fear-conditioned stimulus (CS). A relevant question is whether abstract cues not directly associated with the threat event also trigger reconsolidation, given that anxiety disorders often result from vicarious or unobtrusive learning for which no explicit memory exists. Insofar as the fear memory involves a flexible representation of the original learning experience, we hypothesized that the process of memory reconsolidation may also be triggered by abstract cues. We addressed this hypothesis by using a differential human fear-conditioning procedure in two distinct fear-learning groups. We predicted that if fear learning involves discrimination on basis of perceptual cues within one semantic category (i.e., the perceptual-learning group, n = 15), the subsequent ambiguity of the abstract retrieval cue would not trigger memory reconsolidation. In contrast, if fear learning involves discriminating between two semantic categories (i.e., categorical-learning group, n = 15), an abstract retrieval cue would unequivocally reactivate the fear memory and might subsequently trigger memory reconsolidation. Here we show that memory reconsolidation may indeed be triggered by another cue than the one that was present during the original learning occasion, but this effect depends on the learning history. Evidence for fear memory reconsolidation was inferred from the fear erasing effect of one pill of propranolol (40 mg) systemically administered upon exposure to the abstract retrieval cue. Our finding that reconsolidation of a specific fear association does not require exposure to the original retrieval cue supports the feasibility of reconsolidation -based interventions for emotional disorders.","[Soeter, Marieke; Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Soeter, Marieke; Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, NL-1018 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Kindt, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Weesperpl 4, NL-1018 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands.",M.Kindt@uva.nl,,,Netherlands Organization for Scientific ResearchNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),We thank B.

Here we evaluate the ability of D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine-recognition site on the NMDA receptor complex, to facilitate conditioned fear extinction after systemic administration or intra-amygdala infusions. Rats received 10 pairings of a 3.7 sec light and a 0.4 mA footshock (fear conditioning). Fear-potentiated startle (increased startle in the presence vs the absence of the light) was subsequently measured before and after 30, 60, or 90 presentations of the light without shock (extinction training). Thirty non-reinforced light presentations produced modest extinction, and 60 or 90 presentations produced nearly complete extinction (experiment 1). DCS injections (3.25, 15, or 30 mg/kg) before 30 non-reinforced light exposures dose-dependently enhanced extinction (experiment 2) but did not influence fear-potentiated startle in rats that did not receive extinction training (experiment 3). These effects were blocked by HA-966, an antagonist at the glycine-recognition site (experiment 4). Neither DCS nor HA-966 altered fear-potentiated startle when injected before testing (experiment 5). The effect of systemic administration was mimicked by intra-amygdala DCS (10 mug/side) infusions (experiment 6). These results indicate that treatments that promote NMDA receptor activity after either systemic or intra-amygdala administration promote the extinction of conditioned fear.","Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Walker, DL (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1639 Pierce Dr,Suite 4000, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",dlwalke@emory.edu,"Ressler, Kerry J/N-8741-2018","Ressler, Kerry J/0000-0002-5158-1103","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH059906, P50MH052384, R01MH047840, P50MH058922, R37MH047840, R01MH057250] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 58922, MH 57250, MH 59906, P50 MH052384, R01 MH057250, R01 MH059906, MH 47840, R37 MH047840, P50 MH058922, MH 52384, R01 MH047840] Funding Source: Medline",,,59,625,638,0,27,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,1529-2401,,J NEUROSCI,J.

However, it is currently unknown to what extent connectivity between these regions in the newborn period is relevant for the development of fear and other aspects of negative emotionality (NE), such as sadness. Here, we investigate newborn Am-Ins and Am-vmPFC resting state functional connectivity in relation to developmental trajectories of fear and sadness over the first two years of life using data from the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Revised (IBQ-R) and Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) (N=62). Stronger newborn amygdala connectivity predicts higher fear and sadness at 6-months-of-age and less change from 6 to 24-months-of-age. Interestingly, Am-Ins connectivity was specifically relevant for fear and not sadness, while Am-vmPFC was associated only with sadness. Associations remained consistent after considering variation in maternal sensitivity and maternal postnatal depressive symptomology. Already by the time of birth, individual differences in amygdala connectivity are relevant for the expression of fear over the first two-years-of-life. Additionally, specificity is observed, such that connections relevant for fear development are distinct from those predicting sadness trajectories.","[Thomas, Elina; Ramirez, Julian S.

More than 50% of PTSD patients suffer from chronic pain. This study aimed to examine the role of fear-learning deficits in the link between pain perception and PTSD. We included 19 subjects with PTSD and 21 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects in a fear-conditioning experiment. The conditioned stimulus (CS) consisted of visual signs flashed upon a screen in front of each subject. The unconditioned stimulus was either a low or high temperature impulse delivered through a thermal contact thermode on the subjects' hand. A designation of 'CS-' was assigned to CS always followed by nonpainful low-temperature stimuli; a designation of 'CS+' was given to CS that were randomly followed by either a low or a more painful high temperature. Skin conductance was used as a physiological marker of fear. In healthy control subjects, CS+ induced more fear than CS, and a low-temperature stimulus induced less subjective pain after CS than after CS+. PTSD subjects failed to demonstrate such adaptive conditioning. Fear ratings after CS presentation were significantly higher in the PTSD group than in the control group. There were significant interaction effects between group and the type of CS on fear and pain ratings. Fear-learning deficits are a potentially promising, specific psychopathological factor in altered pain perception associated with PTSD. Deficits in safety learning may increase fear and, consequently, pain sensations. These findings may contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis behind the highly prevalent comorbidity that exists between PTSD and pain disorders, and to developing new treatments. Perspective: This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of chronic pain in patients with PTSD. The findings may help to develop new treatment strategies for this highly prevalent co-morbidity in PTSD.

Tetanic stimulation (TS) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), applied before or following this retraining, facilitates extinction recall. Here we investigated whether mPFC TS can also facilitate expression of fear extinction when rats are retrained with the same shock intensity as during the initial fear acquisition. Rats were implanted with stimulating electrodes in the mPFC and were trained to acquire freezing to a conditioning chamber, in which they had to enter freely. In Experiment I, extinction of this response was followed by reconditioning and then another extinction training. Acquired freezing was extinguished successfully, while reacquired freezing, which was associated with increased chamber entry latencies, was resistant to subsequent extinction. Both reacquired freezing and increased chamber entry latencies were absent in rats that received post-reconditioning mPFC TS. In Experiment 2, post-conditioning mPFC TS had no effect on initially acquired freezing. In Experiment 3, rats were submitted to reconditioning without experiencing extinction training. In this condition, both reacquired freezing and increased chamber entry latencies were still present in rats that received post-reconditioning mPFC TS. These findings provide additional evidence for the fundamental role of the mPFC in maintaining expression of fear extinction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

OTA causes nephrotoxicity and renal tumors in a variety of animal species; however, human health effects are less well-characterized. Various studies have linked OTA exposure with the human diseases Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and chronic interstitial nephropathy (CIN), as well as other renal diseases. This study reviews the epidemiological literature on OTA exposure and adverse health effects in different populations worldwide, and assesses the potential human health risks of OTA exposure. Epidemiological studies identified in a systematic review were used to calculate unadjusted odds ratios for OTA associated with various health endpoints. With one exception, there appears to be no statistically significant evidence for human health risks associated with OTA exposure. One Egyptian study showed a significantly higher risk of nephritic syndrome in those with very high urinary OTA levels compared with relatively unexposed individuals; however, other potential risk factors were not controlled for in the study. Larger cohort or case-control studies are needed in the future to better establish potential OTA-related human health effects, and further duplicate-diet studies are needed to validate biomarkers of OTA exposure in humans.","[Bui-Klimke, Travis R.; Wu, Felicia] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA",,"Wu, F (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, 100 Technol Dr, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA.",few8@pitt.edu,"Bui, Travis/AAX-1983-2020",,"National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [5R01CA153073-2]; US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) [20011-67005-30018]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R01CA153073] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Grant No. 5R01CA153073-2; and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Grant No. 20011-67005-30018.

Non-probability convenient sampling technique was used to recruit participants via a mobile instant messaging application. Reliability, concurrent validity, face validity and factor analysis were examined. The data consisted of 509 adult participants who reside in Saudi Arabia. The internal consistency of the Arabic FIVE subscales was high (0.84-0.91) with strong concurrent validity indicated by positive correlations of FIVE subscales with FCV-19S. Factor analysis suggested slightly different factor structures (Fears of Getting Sick, Fears that Others Get Sick, Fears of the Impact on Social Life and Behaviors Related to Illness and Virus Fears).

We have examined how biomarkers are incorporated into human health risk assessment and have identified several 'required elements'. These include identification of the (clinical) assessment endpoint at the outset, rational selection of the biomarker(s) (the measurement endpoint), biomarker 'validation' (e.g. QA/QC) and biomarker 'qualification' (evidence linking the measurement and assessment endpoints). We discuss these elements in detail and propose that their adoption will facilitate the routine use of biomarkers in environmental risk assessment. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the need for cooperation between those working with biomarkers within human and environmental risk assessment to exchange best practice between common disciplines for mutual advantage.

Abnormal acquisition of conditioned fear has been suggested as a mechanism for the development of PTSD. While some studies of healthy humans suggest that women are either no different or express less conditioned fear responses during conditioning relative to men, differences in the acquisition of conditioned fear between men and women diagnosed with PTSD has not been examined. Methods: Thirty-one participants (18 men; 13 women) with full or subsyndromal PTSD completed a fear conditioning task. Participants were shown computer-generated colored circles that were paired (CS+) or unpaired (CS-) with an aversive electrical stimulus and skin conductance levels were assessed throughout the task. Results: Repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant sex by stimulus interaction during acquisition. Women had greater differential conditioned skin conductance responses (CS+ trials compared to CS- trials) than did men, suggesting greater acquisition of conditioned fear in women with PTSD. Conclusions: In contrast to studies of healthy individuals, we found enhanced acquisition of conditioned fear in women with PTSD. Greater fear conditioning in women may either be a pre-existing vulnerability trait or an acquired phenomenon that emerges in a sex-dependent manner after the development of PTSD. Characterizing the underlying mechanisms of these differences is needed to clarify sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD.

Despite women being more likely than men to develop emotion dysregulation disorders, there are comparatively few studies investigating fear, safety and reward regulation in females. Here, we show that female Long Evans rats did not suppress conditioned freezing in the presence of a safety cue, nor did they extinguish their freezing response, whereas males did both. Females were also more reward responsive during the reward cue until the first footshock exposure, at which point there were no sex differences in reward seeking to the reward cue. Darting analyses suggest females were able to regulate this behavior in response to the safety cue, suggesting they were able to discriminate between fear and safety cues but did not demonstrate this with conditioned suppression of freezing behavior. However, levels of darting in this study were too low to make any definitive conclusions. In summary, females showed a significantly different behavioral profile than males in a task that tested the ability to discriminate among fear, safety and reward cues. This paradigm offers a great opportunity to test for mechanisms that are generating these behavioral sex differences in learned safety and reward seeking.","[Greiner, Eliza M.; Mueller, Iris; Norris, Makenzie R.; Ng, Ka H.; Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, 703 Third St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Mueller, Iris; Ng, Ka H.; Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Purdue Inst Integrat Neurosci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Sangha, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, 703 Third St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sangha@purdue.edu,,"Sangha, Susan/0000-0002-6461-4146",Alexander von Humboldt foundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIMH R01MH110425]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH110425] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank Yolanda Jonker, Signe Hobaugh, Jessica Kerns, Emma Speckelson, Emily Willis, and Mackenzie McIntosh for excellent animal care.

It remains controversial, however, to what extent areas become threat hotspots simply because of high human impacts or due to predisposing ecological conditions. Limits to the taxonomic and geographical extent, resolution and quality of previously available data have precluded a full global assessment of the relative roles of these factors. Here, we use a new global database on the geographical distributions of birds on continents and continental islands to show that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact. Ecological gradients are of secondary importance at a global scale. The converse is true for individual biogeographic realms, within which variation in human impact is reduced and its influence on extinction risk globally is therefore underestimated. These results underline the importance of a global perspective on driving spatial patterns of extinction risk, and the key role of anthropogenic factors in driving the current extinction crisis.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Biodivers & Macroecol Grp, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Imperial Coll London, Div Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; Natl Taiwan Univ, Sch Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Michigan State Univ Museum, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; BirdLife Int, Cambridge CB3 0NA, England; Imperial Coll London, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England",,"Gaston, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Biodivers & Macroecol Grp, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",k.j.gaston@sheffield.ac.uk,"Thomas, Gavin/AAE-8959-2019; Blackburn, Tim M/A-7685-2011; Davies, Richard/H-7447-2019; Blackburn, Tim/AAC-3144-2019; Owens, Ian PF/F-1392-2010; DING, Tzung-Su/AAG-7712-2019","Blackburn, Tim/0000-0003-0152-2663; Owens, Ian/0000-0001-6080-3321; DING, Tzung-Su/0000-0002-1102-3879; Thomas, Gavin/0000-0002-1982-6051",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NER/O/S/2001/01230] Funding Source: researchfish,,,38,97,99,4,73,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Currently, exposure therapy is among the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders, but this intervention is subjectively aversive to patients, causing many to drop out of treatment prematurely. Here we introduce a method to bypass the subjective unpleasantness in conscious exposure, by directly pairing monetary reward with unconscious occurrences of decoded representations of naturally feared animals in the brain. To decode physiological fear representations without triggering excessively aversive reactions, we capitalize on recent advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging decoding techniques, and use a method called hyperalignment to infer the relevant representations of feared animals for a designated participant based on data from other surrogate participants. In this way, the procedure completely bypasses the need for a conscious encounter with feared animals. We demonstrate that our method can lead to reliable reductions in physiological fear responses, as measured by skin conductance as well as amygdala hemodynamic activity. Not only do these results raise the intriguing possibility that naturally occurring fear responses can be reprogrammed outside of conscious awareness, importantly, they also create the rare opportunity to rigorously test a psychological intervention of this nature in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. This may pave the way for a new approach combining the appealing rationale and proven efficacy of conventional psychotherapy with the rigor and leverage of clinical neuroscience.","[Taschereau-Dumouchel, Vincent; Cortese, Aurelio; Chiba, Toshinori; Knotts, J.

As a whole, the participants showed stronger fear responses to the new mammal and animal objects than to furniture objects. Fear responses to mammal and animal objects were comparable. These results suggest that Japanese monkeys show stronger fear responses to objects possessing perceptual properties of animals, as opposed to objects that do not possess such properties.","[Murai, Chizuko] Tamagawa Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Tokyo 1948610, Japan; [Tomonaga, Masaki] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Aichi, Japan",,"Murai, C (corresponding author), Tamagawa Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Tokyo 1948610, Japan.",cmurai@lab.tamagawa.ac.jp,,,"JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; MEXT, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Cooperative Research Program of PRI","Chizuko Murai was supported as a Research Fellow of the JSPS.

This finding has proven extremely valuable for analysis of neural systems associated with fear and anxiety. Until recently, there have been few efforts to develop acoustic startle measurement in nonhuman primates. We report here development of a whole-body acoustic startle protocol in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Eight juvenile rhesus monkeys were tested in a new whole-body (somatic) acoustic startle protocol. Startle responses were assessed in three paradigms: 1) stimulus intensity-response amplitude, 2) prepulse inhibition (PPI), and 3) fear-potentiated startle. Results: Initial studies revealed that the amplitude of whole-body, startle in monkeys, as in rodents and humans, is directly proportional to acoustic stimulus intensity and gradually habituates with repeated exposures. Presentation of a weak acoustic stimulus 45-2020 msec before a startle stimulus reduces startle amplitude by 40%-50%, depending on interstimulus interval length (PPI). We have also measured significant potentiated startle amplitude in the presence of a visual stimulus after pairing it with an inescapable pulse of pressurized air (fear-potentiated startle). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that acoustic startle in nonhuman primates successfully bridges rodent and human research in two broad areas: stimulus-response relationships and behavioral plasticity represented by habituation, PPI, and fear potentiation. The opportunity now emerges to link concepts developed in rodents to the more complex neuroanatomical and cognitive processes common to monkeys and humans.

State dental fear is known to be transmitted from parents to their children in the dental setting, but it is not known how trait fear/anxiety might be shared between parents and offspring long term, and especially for adolescents. Aim: This study aimed to: (a) compare dental fear levels of adolescents and their parents; (b) predict adolescent dental fear based on demographic variables, fear of pain, and parental dental fear; and, (c) determine relative contributions of mothers' and fathers' dental fear to adolescent fear. Design: In this cross-sectional study, the Dental Fear Survey and Fear of Pain Questionnaire-9 were administered to 350 adolescents (age range 11-17) and 515 of their parents, with t test and ANOVA used to calculate between-group differences; multiple linear regression was used to predict adolescent fear from parent fear. Results: Adolescents' dental fear was predicted by their own fear of pain and their parents' dental fear, but not their parents' fear of pain nor their own age or gender. When considered together, fathers' but not mothers' dental fear predicted adolescents' dental fear. Conclusions: Parents' fears/anxieties about dentistry are associated with adolescents' dental fear in a manner suggestive of intergenerational transmission.","[McNeil, Daniel W.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Dent Practice & Rural Hlth, Morgantown, WV USA; [McNeil, Daniel W.] West Virginia Univ, Eberly Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, Morgantown, WV USA; [McNeil, Daniel W.; Randall, Cameron L.; Crout, Richard J.; Weyant, Robert J.; Neiswanger, Katherine; Marazita, Mary L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Oral Hlth Res Appalachia, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Randall, Cameron L.] West Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV USA; [Randall, Cameron L.] Univ Washington, Sch Dent, Dept Oral Hlth Sci, Seatttle, WA USA; [Cohen, Lindsey L.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Psychol, Univ Plaza, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Crout, Richard J.] West Virginia Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Periodont, Morgantown, WV USA; [Weyant, Robert J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Dent Med, Dept Dent Publ Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Neiswanger, Katherine; Marazita, Mary L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Dent Med, Ctr Craniofacial & Dent Genet, Dept Oral Biol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Marazita, Mary L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Clin & Translat Sci, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Marazita, Mary L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"McNeil, DW (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Psychol, 53 Campus Dr,Box 6040, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.; McNeil, DW (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Dent Practice & Rural Hlth, 53 Campus Dr,Box 6040, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",Daniel.McNeil@mail.wvu.edu,,"Neiswanger, Katherine/0000-0002-1250-6813; Weyant, Robert/0000-0002-5252-9120; Cohen, Lindsey/0000-0001-9521-6653; McNeil, Daniel/0000-0002-0766-8455","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [R01 DE 014899, R21 DE 026540]; University of PittsburghUniversity of Pittsburgh; West Virginia University; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [R21DE026540, R01DE014899] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, Grant/Award Number: R01 DE 014899 and R21 DE 026540; University of Pittsburgh; West Virginia University",,46,3,3,4,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-7439,1365-263X,,INT J PAEDIATR DENT,Int.

Previous research has shown that conditioned safety learning is impaired in patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using a translational approach, the present study aimed to investigate whether individual responses to an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) in rats (basic science), non-traumatized (pre-clinical) or traumatized humans (clinical) predicts their response to a conditioned fear or safety stimulus. Using three different archival datasets, the unconditioned response (UCR) to the US during fear or safety conditioning was assessed in rats, non-traumatized humans, and trauma-exposed humans. The response to learned fear (CS+; context) and safety (CS-) was measured by the modulation of the startle response (rats, traumatized humans) or skin conductance response (non-traumatized humans). Our results showed that all groups with low UCR and those with high UCR from the rodent or non-traumatized human samples displayed lower fear response to the CSthan to the CS+ . Traumatized humans with high UCR showed similarly high responses to the CS+ and CS-. While all groups showed a positive association between the UCR and CS+ response, the UCR correlated positively with the CSresponse in traumatized humans only. Our findings suggest that an elevated response to aversive stimuli predicts deficits in conditioned safety memory in those at risk for trauma-related disorders and confirms that impaired safety learning could be a valid biomarker for these diseases.","[Kreutzmann, Judith C.; Fendt, Markus] Otto von Guericke Univ, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Kreutzmann, Judith C.] Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Marin, Marie-France] Montreal Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Marin, Marie-France] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Fendt, Markus] Otto von Guericke Univ, Ctr Behav Brain Sci, Magdeburg, Germany; [Milad, Mohammed R.] NYU, Dept Psychiat, Grossman Sch Med, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ressler, Kerry; Jovanovic, Tanja] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Kreutzmann, Judith C.; Jovanovic, Tanja] Wayne State Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, 245 Tolan Pk Med Bldg,3901 Chrysler Serv Dr, Detroit, MI 48201 USA",,"Jovanovic, T (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, 245 Tolan Pk Med Bldg,3901 Chrysler Serv Dr, Detroit, MI 48201 USA.",tjovanovic@med.wayne.edu,"; Fendt, Markus/G-1888-2013","Marin, Marie-France/0000-0003-0297-5680; Fendt, Markus/0000-0002-3451-1226",,,,69,3,3,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4328,1872-7549,,BEHAV BRAIN RES,Behav.

Fifty horses, aged 14 +/- 6 years, of different breed and gender, entered the study. For each horse, a caretaker was asked to fill in a validated temperament questionnaire. A novel object fear test (NOT), has been selected from literature to examine fearfulness. Temperature of the lacrimal caruncle was measured before the test and after the test on 22 horses, representative of the whole sample. To assess discriminant validity of the NOT, 3 human-animal relationship tests were performed on the same horses. Data were analyzed with descriptive, nonparametric, and multivariate statistic methods. No significant differences were found between females and geldings for any of the measured variables. Horses that were described by caretakers as more prone to panic, vigilant, excitable, skittish, and nervous (P < 0.001) needed significantly longer time to reapproach the novel object (P < 0.01). Eye temperature was significantly higher after the NOT compared to basal (P < 0.01), with subjects who did not reapproach the novel object tending to present larger increases (P < 0.10). Horses showing more fear-related responses to the NOT did not show more negative reactions to humans during the human-animal tests. These results suggest that, to some extent, the NOT predicts horses' behavior in real on-farm situations. Our findings reject the hypothesis that reactivity to humans and general fearfulness belong to the same basic feature of temperament. Importantly, infrared thermography proved to be useful in assessing physiological reactions of fear in horses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Gagging is a behavioral response that interferes with oral health care and may be related to dental care-related fear. Little is known, however, about the epidemiology of gagging during dental treatment. Methods. To explore this phenomenon, the authors recruited participants from the waiting area of an oral diagnosis clinic. Participants completed a gagging behavior questionnaire, the Dental Fear Survey, the Fear of Pain Questionnaire-9, the Revised Dental Beliefs Survey and a demographics questionnaire. Results. Almost one-half of the 478 participants reported gagging on at least one occasion during dental visits, and 7.5 percent of participants reported almost always or always gagging. With higher frequency of problems with gagging, patients were more likely to have greater levels of dental care-related fear, fear of pain and more negative beliefs about dental professionals and dental treatment. Furthermore, participants who gagged more readily had greater dental care-related fear than did participants who had less of a propensity to gag. Conclusions. Gagging in the dental office is a prevalent problem, and dental care-related fear and fear of pain are associated with more frequent gagging.","[Randall, Cameron L.; McNeil, Daniel W.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Psychol, Eberly Coll Arts & Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Randall, Cameron L.] Ctr Oral Hlth Res Appalachia, Pittsburgh, WV USA; [Randall, Cameron L.] Ctr Oral Hlth Res Appalachia, Morgantown, WV USA; [Shulman, Grant P.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Crout, Richard J.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Periodont, Sch Dent, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [McNeil, Daniel W.] W Virginia Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Dent Practice & Rural Hlth, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",,"McNeil, DW (corresponding author), W Virginia Univ, Sch Dent, G110 Hlth Sci Ctr,POB 9415, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",dmcneil@wvu.edu,,,"West Virginia University School of Dentistry Research Committee; West Virginia University Research Challenge Fund; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [2R01 DE014899]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [R01DE014899] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Partial support for this project was provided through the West Virginia University School of Dentistry Research Committee.

However, a second group of monkeys, which received the lesion after training, successfully demonstrated fear-potentiated startle learned prior to the lesion. Methods: In the current experiment, the eight monkeys used in the second part of the original study, four of which had bilateral amygdala lesions and the four control animals, were trained using an auditory cue and tested in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm. This test was performed to determine whether they could acquire fear-potentiated startle to a new cue. Results: Monkeys with essentially complete damage to the amygdala (based on histological analysis) that had retained and expressed fear-potentiated startle to a visual cue learned before the lesion failed to acquire fear-potentiated startle to an auditory cue when training occurred after the lesion. Conclusions: The results suggest that while the nonhuman primate amygdala is essential for the initial acquisition of fear conditioning, it does not appear to be necessary for the memory and expression of conditioned fear. These findings are discussed in relation to a network of connections between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex that may subserve different component processes of fear conditioning.","[Amaral, David G.] Univ Calif Davis, MIND Inst, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Antoniadis, Elena A.; Amaral, David G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Antoniadis, Elena A.; Amaral, David G.] Univ Calif Davis, Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Winslow, James T.] NIMH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Davis, Michael] Emory Univ, Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Davis, Michael] Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Davis, Michael] Emory Univ, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Amaral, DG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, MIND Inst, 2825 50th St, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.",dgamaral@ucdavis.edu,,,"National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R37 MH057502, MH 41479, R37 MH47840, 2P50 MH58922]; McDonnell Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Intramural Program of the National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); California National Primate Research Center (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RR00169]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P51RR000169] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH058922, R37MH047840, ZICMH002902, R37MH057502, R01MH041479, R37MH041479] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants & R37 MH057502 and MH 41479 and a Grant from the McDonnell Foundation to DGA, NIH Grants R37 MH47840 and 2P50 MH58922 to MD, a Grant from The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to EAA, and the Intramural Program of the National Institute of Mental Health to JTW.

However, much of what is known about neural dysfunction in PTSD is based on research in chronic PTSD populations. Less is known about neural function that supports fear learning acutely following trauma exposure. Determining the acute effects of trauma exposure on brain function would provide new insight into the neural processes that mediate the cognitive-affective dysfunction associated with PTSD. Therefore, the present study investigated neural activity that supports fear learning and memory processes in recently Trauma-Exposed (TE) and Non Trauma-Exposed (NTE) participants. Participants completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, participants' threat expectancy was continuously monitored. NTE participants showed greater threat expectancy during warning than safety cues, while no difference was observed in the TE group. This finding suggests TE participants overgeneralized the fear association to the safety cue. Further, only the TE group showed a negative relationship between fMRI signal responses within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and threat expectancy during safety cues. These results suggest the dorsomedial PFC mediates overgeneralization of learned fear as an acute result of trauma exposure. Finally, neural activity within the PFC and inferior parietal lobule showed a negative relationship with PTSD symptom severity assessed three months posttrauma.

Here we examined the impact of exposure to a stressor in a different environment on subsequent fear conditioning and extinction, and whether the degree of behavioral control that the subject has over the stressor is of importance. Rats received a session of either escapable (controllable) tail shock (ES), yoked inescapable (uncontrollable) tail shock (IS), or control treatment (home cage, HC) 7 days before fear conditioning in which a tone and foot shock were paired. Conditioning was measured 24 h later. In a second experiment rats received ES, IS or HC 24 h after contextual fear conditioning. Extinction then occurred every day beginning 7 days later until a criterion was reached. Spontaneous recovery of fear was assessed 14 days after extinction. IS potentiated fear conditioning when given before fear conditioning, and potentiated fear responding during extinction when given after conditioning. Importantly, ES potently interfered with later fear conditioning, decreased fear responding during fear extinction, and prevented spontaneous recovery of fear. Additionally, we examined if the activation of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFCv) by ES is critical for the protective effects of ES on later fear conditioning. Inactivation of the mPFCv with muscimol at the time of the initial experience with control prevented ES-induced reductions in later contextual and auditory fear conditioning. Finally, we explored if the protective effects of ES extended to an unconditioned fear stimulus, ferret odor. Unlike conditioned fear, prior ES increased the fear response to ferret odor to the same degree as did IS. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The present study tested the hypothesis that alprazolam would reduce the sustained startle potentiation to contextual threats but not the startle potentiation to a threat cue. Methods: Sixteen healthy subjects received each of four treatments: placebo, .5 mg of alprazolam, 7 mg of alprazolam, and 50 mg of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions, including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks were administered unpredictably, and a third condition in which no shocks were anticipated. Acoustic startle were delivered regularly across conditions. Results: Phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was not affected by alprazolam. in contrast, the sustained increase in startle in the predictable and unpredictable conditions was reduced significantly by the high dose of alprazolam. Conclusions: Startle responses to an explicit threat cue and to an aversive context are psychopharmacologically distinct, suggesting that they may represent functionally dissociable aversive states.","NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorder Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorder Program, 15K N Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 113,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",christian.grillon@nih.gov,"Lissek, Shmuel/B-6577-2008; Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019","Lissek, Shmuel/0000-0001-7384-371X; Baas, Johanna/0000-0001-6267-8712","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798, Z01MH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA Funding Source: Medline",,,42,113,113,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

The T allele of rs324981, which goes along with enhanced receptor function, was associated with panic disorder, increased anxiety sensitivity in healthy subjects, attenuated prefrontal brain activation and elevated amygdala responses to fear-relevant stimuli. To investigate whether prefrontal attenuations in rs324981 T allele carriers are specific to fear-relevant stimulus content and cannot be attributed to a generally higher interference of emotional stimuli, 92 subjects performed a combined cognitive and emotional Stroop task while oxygenation changes in the prefrontal cortex were recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results showed a specific NPSR1 gene activation modulation in response to fear-relevant word stimuli. Only A-homozygotes displayed an emotional Stroop effect in terms of increased activation to fear-relevant stimuli in medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Specifically, activation in the fear-relevant condition was higher in A-homozygotes as compared to T allele carriers while no group differences were found during neutral, congruent or highly interfering incongruent color word presentation. The current results are in line with earlier imaging genetic studies and suggest a potential protective function of the NPSR1 rs324981 A/A genotype against pathologically enhanced anxiety that might be explained by stronger reflective prefrontal regulation over the subcortical fear response.

Instead of assuming that fear is negatively associated with voice, I argue that this relationship may be more complex. Adopting a functional view of emotions, I hypothesize that fears from external sources focus attention on shared threat to the organization and may be positively associated with employee voice. This effect is likely contingent: when employees perceive their supervisors as open to input, they are motivated to speak up. Thus, perceptions of supervisor openness can help transform other-focused motives resulting from fearing external threat into information-sharing. Results from two studies suggest that fear of external threat positively relates to voice when employees perceive their supervisor as open to input. Additionally, results suggest that this interactive effect is mediated by prosocial motivation spurring employees to speak up when fearing external threat. (C) 2016 The Author.

These disorders are assumed to involve aversive learning under acute and/or chronic stress. Importantly, fear conditioning and stress share common neuronal circuits. The stress response involves multiple changes interacting in a time-dependent manner (a) the fast first-wave stress response [with central actions of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), plus increased sympathetic tone and peripheral catecholamine release] and (b) the second-wave stress response [with peripheral release of glucocorticoids (GCs) after activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis]. Control of fear during extinction is also sensitive to these stress-response mediators. In the present review, we will thus examine current animal and human data, addressing the role of stress and single stress-response mediators for successful acquisition, consolidation and recall of fear extinction. We report studies using pharmacological manipulations targeting a number of stress-related neurotransmitters and neuromodulators [monoamines, opioids, endocannabinoids (eCBs), neuropeptide Y, oxytocin, GCs] and behavioral stress induction. As anxiety, trauma- and stressor-related disorders are more common in women, recent research focuses on female sex hormones and identifies a potential role for estradiol in fear extinction. We will thus summarize animal and human data on the role of estradiol and explore possible interactions with stress or stress-response mediators in extinction. This also aims at identifying time-windows of enhanced (or reduced) sensitivity for fear extinction, and thus also for successful exposure therapy.","[Stockhorst, Ursula; Antov, Martin I.] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Psychol, Expt Psychol & Biol Psychol 2, Osnabruck, Germany",,"Stockhorst, U (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, Inst Psychol, Expt Psychol & Biol Psychol 2, Osnabruck, Germany.",ursula.stockhorst@uni-osnabrueck.de,"Antov, Martin I./AAF-8411-2020","Antov, Martin I./0000-0003-3760-5292",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publishing Fund of Osnabruck University,We acknowledge support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and Open Access Publishing Fund of Osnabruck University.,,271,39,39,2,26,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

It has been suggested that some cognitive states may be inferred from respiration amplitude responses (RAR) after external events. Here, we investigate whether RAR allow assessment of fear memory in cued fear conditioning, an experimental model of aversive learning. To this end, we built on a previously developed psychophysiological model (PsPM) of RAR, which regards interpolated RAR time series as the output of a linear time invariant system. We first establish that average RAR after CS+ and CS- are different. We then develop the response function of fear-conditioned RAR, to be used in our PsPM. This PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of cognitive input into the respiratory system. We analyze five validation experiments involving fear acquisition and retention, delay and trace conditioning, short and medium CS-US intervals, and data acquired with bellows and MRI-compatible pressure chest belts. In all experiments, CS+ and CS- are distinguished by their estimated cognitive inputs, and the sensitivity of this distinction is higher for model-based estimates than for peak scoring of RAR. Comparing these data with skin conductance responses (SCR) and heart period responses (HPR), we find that, on average, RAR performs similar to SCR in distinguishing CS+ and CS-, but is less sensitive than HPR. Overall, our work provides a novel and robust tool to investigate fear memory in humans that may allow wide and straightforward application to diverse experimental contexts.","[Castegnetti, Giuseppe; Tzovara, Athina; Staib, Matthias; Gerster, Samuel; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Castegnetti, Giuseppe; Tzovara, Athina; Staib, Matthias; Gerster, Samuel; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tzovara, Athina; Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England",,"Castegnetti, G (corresponding author), Psychiat Univ Klin Zurich, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",giuseppe.castegnetti@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik R/B-4302-2019","Bach, Dominik R/0000-0003-3717-2036; Gerster, Samuel/0000-0001-6507-739X; Tzovara, Athina/0000-0002-7588-1418; Staib, Matthias/0000-0001-9688-838X",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [320030_1449586/1]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [091593/Z/10/Z],This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (320030_1449586/1).

Its most fundamental underlying mechanism is considered to be plasticity of synaptic connections between excitatory projection neurons (PNs). However, recent studies suggest that while PNs execute critical memory functions, their activity at key stages of learning and recall is extensively orchestrated by a diverse array of GABAergic interneurons (INs). Here we review the contributions of geneticallydefined INs to processing of threat-related stimuli in fear conditioning, with a particular focus on how synaptic interactions within interconnected networks of INs modulates PN activity through both inhibition and disinhibition. Furthermore, we discuss accumulating evidence that GABAergic microcircuits are an important locus for synaptic plasticity during fear learning and therefore a viable substrate for long-term memory. These findings suggest that further investigation of INs could unlock unique conceptual insights into the organization and function of fear memory networks.","[Cummings, Kirstie A.; Lacagnina, Anthony F.; Clem, Roger L.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Nash Family Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Cummings, Kirstie A.; Lacagnina, Anthony F.; Clem, Roger L.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Cummings, Kirstie A.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",,"Clem, RL (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Nash Family Dept Neurosci, New York, NY 10029 USA.; Clem, RL (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Friedman Brain Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA.",roger.clem@mssm.edu,,,"NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K99 MH122228, R01 MH116445, MH124880]","This work was supported by NIMH grants R01 MH116445 and MH124880 to RLC, and NIMH grant K99 MH122228 to KAC.",,161,0,0,9,10,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1074-7427,1095-9564,,NEUROBIOL LEARN MEM,Neurobiol.

This study aimed to identify the most common and relevant pathways of fear and anxiety related to root canal treatment in different ethnic groups. Methods: All participants visiting the Griffith University Dental Clinics, Gold Coast, Australia, were invited to participate if they had undergone primary root canal treatment or were scheduled to undergo the same. Patients with mental disabilities, those with no history of root canal treatment, those who only had surgical root canal treatment, and those below 20 years old were excluded. All participants completed the My Endodontic Fear questionnaire. Results: Eight hundred seventy-nine patients (20-90 years old) who had root canal treatment or were scheduled to have one consented to participate in this study. White (54.5%) and Arab/African respondents (30.9%) were more likely (P < .001) to use the conditioning pathway compared with East Asian (10.5%) or Aboriginal/Pacific Islander groups (3.9%). Age was a significant factor for all ethnicities (P < .05); 40-year-old and 65+-year-old groups showed less fear compared with the 20- to 39-year old groups. Female sex was significantly related to the use of the informative (P < .001) and parental (P = .002) pathways. Conclusions: The present study showed that different pathways appear to be adopted by different ethnic groups, indicating the importance of customizing strategies in a multicultural society-to manage fear and anxiety related to root canal treatment.","[Cartel, Ava Elizabeth; George, Roy] Griffith Univ, Sch Dent & Oral Hlth, Gold Coast, Qld 4215, Australia; [Carter, Geoffrey] Griffith Univ, Sch Human Educ & Resources, Gold Coast, Qld 4215, Australia; [Boschen, Mark] Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Gold Coast, Qld 4215, Australia; [AlShwaimi, Emad] Univ Dammam, Coll Dent, Dammam, Saudi Arabia",,"George, R (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, G40, Gold Coast, Qld 4215, Australia.",drroygeorge@gmail.com,"AlShwaimi, Emad/A-4408-2015; Boschen, Mark/G-2550-2015","AlShwaimi, Emad/0000-0002-6110-2495; Boschen, Mark/0000-0002-4944-5970",,,,34,8,8,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0099-2399,1878-3554,,J ENDODONT,J.

In this study, we used comprehensive physiochemical indicators to assess the quality of groundwater used for drinking and irrigation in addition to the potential risks to local residents in a riverbank filtration site. Human health risks through drinking water intake and dermal contact were also estimated. Moreover, we analyzed the spatial distribution regularities of health risk values in a riverbank filtration site. The assessment results revealed that NH4-N, NO2-N, F-, Mn, and As are main contaminants affecting groundwater quality and that 62% of the total samples is suitable for a variety of purposes. All groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation based on the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Na percentage (%Na), and U.S. Salinity Laboratory (USSL) and Wilcox diagrams. The health risk assessment suggests that residents in the study area are at high health risk, and women and children face higher risk than men in both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. The spatial distribution regularities of health risk values suggest that the human health risk value of each groundwater sample is different in the study area and has certain regularity.

These advancements were spurred on by envisioning fear as emerging from the coordinated activation of brain and behavioral systems that evolved for the purpose of defense from environmental dangers. Recently, Joseph LeDoux, a previous proponent of this view, published a series of papers in which he challenges the value of this approach. As an alternative, he and colleagues propose that a 'two-system' framework for the study of responses to threat will expedite the advancement of medical treatments for fear disorders. This view suggests one system for autonomic and behavioral responses and a second for the subjective feeling of fear. They argue that these two systems operate orthogonally and thus inferences concerning the emotion of fear cannot be gleaned from physiological and behavioral measures; confounding these systems has impeded the mechanistic understanding and treatment of fear disorders. Counter to the claim that this view will advance scientific progress, it carries the frightening implication that we ought to reduce the study of fear to subjective report. Here, we outline why we believe that fear is best considered an integrated autonomic, behavioral, and cognitive emotional response to danger emerging from a central fear generator whose evolutionarily conserved function is that of defense. Furthermore, we argue that although components of the fear response can be independently modulated and studied, common upstream brain regions dictate their genesis, and therefore inferences about a central fear state can be garnered from measures of each.","[Fanselow, Michael S.; Pennington, Zachary T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 8548 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Fanselow, MS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 8548 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",fanselow@psych.ucla.edu,,"Fanselow, Michael/0000-0002-3850-5966; Pennington, Zachary/0000-0001-9423-9319",MSF [RO1MH062122]; ZTP [F31MH185207-02]; Staglin Center for Behavioral and Brain Health; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062122] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Supported by RO1MH062122 to MSF, F31MH185207-02 to ZTP, and the Staglin Center for Behavioral and Brain Health.",,82,39,39,0,5,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

Although a variety of procedures are available to prepare risk assessments in general, there are no published examples of risks associated with the use of human samples in research. To cover this gap and to give an overview of the evaluation performed in our institution, we summarized the potential risks for the use of human samples in research identified in the projects under the remit of the UCL/UCLH Biobank. The procedures of acquisition, transportation, storage, use, and disposal of human samples, and security of the premises were analyzed. From our experience, there are governance-related risks associated with the process of consenting the patients, with the donor confidentiality, with mislabeling of samples and with the ethical approval associated with the project, and they generally do not compromise the integrity of the samples. On the other hand, samples' integrity is more at risk during collection, storage, transport, and use of the sample. Adequate training and having appropriate standard procedures in place and available for all staff seem to be the most effective control measures to prevent any issue. In addition, appropriate equipment maintenance, contingency plans, and strict regulation and monitoring of the facility security should always be in place. In summary, an appropriate evaluation of the risks associated with the use of human samples in research is one of the requirements for the use of human samples in research and it is fundamental for the protection of staff, students, the institution itself, and the patients. Supporting biobanking, implementing a culture of biosafety in the life sciences, and raising awareness in the scientific and regulatory communities are key ways to anticipate future problems associated with biological and governance risks.","[Miranda, Elena; Alves, Adriana] UCL, Canc Inst, Biobank & Pathol Translat Technol Platform, Rockefeller Bldg Room 201,21 Univ St, London WC1E 6DE, England; [Pye, Hayley] UCL, Div Surg & Intervent Sci, Mol Diagnost & Therapeut Grp, London, England; [Buckingham, Sonia] UCL, Canc Inst, London, England; [Rodriguez-Justo, Manuel] Univ Coll London Hosp, Dept Cell Pathol, London, England; [Rodriguez-Justo, Manuel] UCL, Canc Inst, Res Dept Pathol, London, England",,"Miranda, E (corresponding author), UCL, Canc Inst, Biobank & Pathol Translat Technol Platform, Rockefeller Bldg Room 201,21 Univ St, London WC1E 6DE, England.",elena.miranda@ucl.ac.uk,,"Miranda, Elena/0000-0002-4166-5979",ECMC; Prostate Cancer UK; Prostate Cancer UK Centre of Excellence,E.M. and A.A. are partially funded by CRUK.

N=22 participants underwent differential fear conditioning and extinction with face pictures as conditioned stimuli (CS) and loud noise bursts as aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) on Day 1 and a recall test 1 day later. We assessed ERPs, evoked heart period (HP), and time-lagged within-subject correlations of single-trial EEG amplitude and HP as index for corticocardiac coupling in response to the CS. Fear-conditioned stimuli (CS+) triggered cardiac deceleration during fear acquisition and recall. Meanwhile, only during Day 1 acquisition, CS+ evoked larger late positivities in the ERP than CS-. Most importantly, during Day 2 recall, stimulus-evoked single-trial EEG responses in the time window between 250 and 500 ms predicted the magnitude of cardiac fear responses 2 to 5 s later. This marker of corticocardiac coupling selectively emerged in response to not previously extinguished CS+ but was absent in response to CS- or previously extinguished CS+. The present results provide first evidence that fear conditioning and extinction modulate functional corticocardiac coupling in humans. Underlying mechanisms may involve subcortical structures enhancing corticocardiac transmission to facilitate processing of consolidated conditioned fear.","[Panitz, Christian; Hermann, Christiane; Mueller, Erik M.] Univ Giessen, Dept Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",,"Panitz, C (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Otto Behaghel Str 10F, D-35394 Giessen, Germany.",Christian.Panitz@psychol.uni-giessen.de,"Mueller, Erik/ABE-1757-2021; Mueller, Erik Malte/N-5710-2014; Panitz, Christian/AAJ-3506-2020","Mueller, Erik/0000-0002-8721-8963; Mueller, Erik Malte/0000-0002-8721-8963; Panitz, Christian/0000-0001-6692-8555",,,,55,24,24,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,OCT,2015,52,10,,,,,1351,1360,,10.1111/psyp.12498,,,10,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,CQ7DJ,WOS:000360762800009,26189975,,,,2022-04-16,

Current impediments to effective application of these technologies include appropriate normalization procedures (as there is no fixed point in transcript space), confirmation of data quality and demonstration of the functional significance of responses observed. Providing risk assessors with statistically and functionally unconfirmed, large-scale gene expression data sets that generally defy interpretation is not an appropriate approach. We propose that a logical process of data generation be developed, with risk assessment in mind from the outset. The basic principles of toxicology should be applied to selection of experimental systems, dose and duration of exposure, along with appropriate statistical analyses and biological interpretation.

This review discusses the potential mechanisms involved in this facilitation and its implications for developing theories of fear conditioning in humans. Basic research in rodents suggests that DCS acts by speeding up extinction. However, several laboratory-based investigations found that DCS had no effect on extinction in humans. This report proposes that these observations can be accounted for by a dual-model theory of fear conditioning in humans that engages two complementary defensive systems: a reflexive lower-order system independent of conscious awareness and a higher-order cognitive system associated with conscious awareness of danger and expectation. The DCS studies in animals seem to have explored lower-order conditioning mechanisms, whereas human studies have explored higher-order cognitive processes. These observations suggest that DCS might act preferentially on lower-rather than higher-order learning. This report presents evidence suggesting that, in humans, DCS might similarly affect lower-order learning during exposure-based therapy and, consequently, might be less effective during cognitive therapy (e.g., cognitive restructuring). Finally, it is recommended that extinction studies using DCS in humans be conducted with fear-relevant stimuli (e.g., snakes), short conditional stimulus-unconditioned stimulus intervals and intense unconditioned stimulus to promote lower-order conditioning processes.","NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, MAP, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, MAP, 15K North Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 113,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,,,National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Financial support for his study was provided by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health.

Such behavior can be assessed with the open field test (OFT), which is a well-established indicator of animal fear. The detection of similar open field behavior in humans may verify the translational validity of this paradigm. Enhanced thigmotaxis related to anxiety may suggest the relevance of such behavior for anxiety disorders, especially agoraphobia. METHODS: A global positioning system was used to analyze the behavior of 16 patients with agoraphobia and 18 healthy individuals with a risk for agoraphobia (i.e., high anxiety sensitivity) during a human OFT and compare it with appropriate control groups (n = 16 and n = 19). We also tracked 17 patients with agoraphobia and 17 control participants during a city walk that involved walking through an open market square. RESULTS: Our human OFT triggered thigmotaxis in participants; patients with agoraphobia and participants with high anxiety sensitivity exhibited enhanced thigmotaxis. This behavior was evident in increased movement lengths along the wall of the natural open field and fewer entries into the center of the field despite normal movement speed and length. Furthermore, participants avoided passing through the market square during the city walk, indicating again that thigmotaxis is related to agoraphobia. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to our knowledge to verify the translational validity of the OFT and to reveal that thigmotaxis, an evolutionarily adaptive behavior shown by most species, is related to agoraphobia, a pathologic fear of open spaces, and anxiety sensitivity, a risk factor for agoraphobia.","[Walz, Nora; Muehlberger, Andreas; Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany; [Muehlberger, Andreas] Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Regensburg, Germany",,"Pauli, P (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",pauli@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Pauli, Paul/0000-0003-0692-6720","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB-TRR58, RTG 1253/2, B01]","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB-TRR58 project B01 to PP and AM, and RTG 1253/2).",,33,40,40,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

However, humans can be unpredictable predators and anthropogenic cues that animals perceive may not be reliable indicators of the risk of being killed. In these cases, animal fear responses may be ineffective and may even exacerbate the risk of anthropogenic mortality. Here, we explore these questions using a 10-year dataset of movement and mortality events for the puma Puma concolor population in the fragmented Santa Cruz Mountains of California, for whom the leading cause of death was retaliatory killings by people following livestock loss. We modeled retaliatory killing risk and puma habitat selection relative to residential housing density to evaluate whether puma avoidance of human cues reflected their risk of being killed. We documented a mismatch between human cues, fear responses and actual risk. Rather than scaling directly with housing density, retaliatory killings occurred at intermediate levels of human development and at night. Pumas avoided these areas during the day but selected for these high-risk areas at night, resulting in a mismatch between cue and risk impacting 17% of the study area. These results are unlikely to be driven by puma hunting behavior: livestock constitute a very small proportion of puma diets, and we found no evidence for the alternative hypothesis that state-dependent foraging drove depredation of livestock and subsequent retaliatory killings. Our findings indicate that puma responses to human cues are not sufficient to enable human-carnivore coexistence in this area and suggest that reducing risk from humans in places with few perceptible human cues would facilitate carnivore conservation in human-dominated landscapes. Furthermore, a mismatch between human cues and responses by carnivores can lead to selection rather than avoidance of risky areas, which could result in an ecological trap.","[Nisi, Anna C.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Nisi, Anna C.] Univ Washington, Biol Dept, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Benson, John F.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Nisi, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",nisianna@gmail.com,,"Nisi, Anna/0000-0003-0286-3187","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0963022, 1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Peninsula Open Space Trust",This work was funded by NSF grants 0963022 and 1255913 and by the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Peninsula Open Space Trust.,,66,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,,,,,,,,,,,e09051,10.1111/oik.09051,,MAR 2022,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZZ8GM,WOS:000773503100001,,hybrid,,,2022-04-16,

A limited number of laboratory investigations of marijuana effects on human risk taking have been conducted. The present study was designed to examine the acute effects of smoked marijuana on human risk taking, and to identify behavioral mechanisms that may be involved in drug-induced changes in the probability of risky behavior. Using a laboratory measure of risk taking designed to address acute drug effects, 10 adults were administered placebo cigarettes and three doses of active marijuana cigarettes (half placebo and half 1.77%; 1.77%; and 3.58% Delta(9)-THC) in a within-subject repeated-measures experimental design. The risk-taking task presented subjects with a choice between two response options operationally defined as risky and nonrisky. Data analyses examined cardiovascular and subjective effects, response rates, distribution of choices between the risky and nonrisky option, and first-order transition probabilities of trial-by-trial data. The 3.58% THC dose increased selection of the risky response option, and uniquely shifted response probabilities following both winning and losing outcomes following selection of the risky option. Acute marijuana administration thereby produced measurable changes in risky decision making under laboratory conditions. Consistent with previous risk-taking studies, shifts in trial-by-trial response probabilities at the highest dose suggested a change in sensitivity to both reinforced and losing risky outcomes. Altered sensitivity to consequences may be a mechanism in drug-induced changes in risk taking. Possible neurobiological sites of action related to THC are discussed.","Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,"Lane, SD (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 1300 Moursund St, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",scott.d.lane@uth.tmc.edu,,,"NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01 DA12968, R01 DA15392] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA015392, R01DA012968] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,85,112,113,0,22,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0893-133X,,,NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOL,Neuropsychopharmacology,APR,2005,30,4,,,,,800,809,,10.1038/sj.npp.1300620,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,907JY,WOS:000227714300017,15775958,Bronze,,,2022-04-16,

A less studied aspect of fear-based psychopathologies and their treatment, awareness of learned fear is a common cause of distress in persons with such conditions and is a focus of their treatment. The present work is a substudy of a broader fear-conditioning fMRI study. Following fear conditioning, we identified a subset of individuals who did not exhibit explicit awareness of the CS-US contingency. This prompted an exploratory analysis of differences in aware versus unaware individuals after fear conditioning. Self-reported expectancies of the CS-US contingency obtained immediately following fear conditioning were used to differentiate the two groups. Results corrected for multiple comparisons indicated significantly greater BOLD signal in the bilateral dlPFC, right vmPFC, bilateral vlPFC, left insula, left hippocampus, and bilateral amygdala for the CS+>CS- contrast in the aware group compared with the unaware group (all p values <= 0.004). PPI analysis with a left hippocampal seed indicated stronger coupling with the dlPFC and vmPFC in the aware group compared with the unaware group (all p values <= 0.002).

Recently, U.S. EPA evaluated the human PBPK models for perchlorate and radioiodide for their ability to estimate the relative sensitivity of perchlorate inhibition on thyroidal radioiodide uptake for various population groups and lifestages. The most well-defined mode of action of the environmental contaminant, perchlorate, is competitive inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). In this analysis, a six-step framework for PBPK model evaluation was followed, and with a few modifications, the models were determined to be suitable for use in HHRA to evaluate relative sensitivity among human lifestages. Relative sensitivity to perchlorate was determined by comparing the PBPK model predicted percent inhibition of thyroidal radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) by perchlorate for different lifestages. A limited sensitivity analysis indicated that model parameters describing urinary excretion of perchlorate and iodide were particularly important in prediction of RAIU inhibition; therefore, a range of biologically plausible values available in the peer-reviewed literature was evaluated. Using the updated PBPK models, the greatest sensitivity to RAIU inhibition was predicted to be the near-term fetus (gestation week 40) compared to the average adult and other lifestages; however, when exposure factors were taken into account, newborns were found to be populations that need further evaluation and consideration in a risk assessment for perchlorate.","[McLanahan, Eva D.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [White, Paul; Flowers, Lynn; Schlosser, Paul M.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, Washington, DC 20460 USA",,"McLanahan, ED (corresponding author), US EPA, Mailcode B243-01, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.",McLanahan.Eva@epa.gov,,"Schlosser, Paul/0000-0002-9699-9108",,,,38,11,11,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,FEB,2014,34,2,,,,,356,366,,10.1111/risa.12101,,,11,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",AA8PV,WOS:000331358300012,23901895,,,,2022-04-16,

Experimental fear conditioning studies support that amygdala-localized fear memories are attenuated when reconsolidation is disrupted through extinction training immediately following memory activation. Recently, using functional brain imaging in individuals with lifelong spider fears, we demonstrated that fear memory activation followed by repeated exposure to feared cues after 10 min, thereby disrupting reconsolidation, attenuated activity in the amygdala during later re-exposure, and also facilitated approach behavior to feared cues. In contrast, repeated exposure 6 h after fear memory activation, allowing for reconsolidation, did not attenuate amygdala activity and resulted in less approach behavior as compared to the group that received disrupted reconsolidation. We here evaluated if these effects are stable after 6 months and found that amygdala activity was further reduced in both groups, with a tendency towards greater reductions in the 10 min than the 6 h group. Hence, disrupted reconsolidation results in long lasting attenuation of amygdala activity. The behavioral effect, with more approach towards previously feared cues, in the 10 min than the 6 h group also persisted. Thus, the brain effect of disrupted reconsolidation is stable over 6 months and the behavioral effect also remained. We therefore conclude that disrupted reconsolidation result in a long-lasting diminished fear memory representation in the amygdala which may have clinical importance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In support of this idea, mice selectively bred for high (HAP) alcohol preference show greater fear potentiated startle (FPS), a model for fear-related disorders such as PTSD, compared to mice selectively bred for low (LAP) alcohol preference. This positive genetic correlation between alcohol preference and FPS behavior suggests that the two traits may be functionally related. This study examined the effects of fear conditioning on alcohol consumption and the effects of alcohol consumption on the expression of FPS in male and female HAP2 and LAP2 mice. In experiment 1, alcohol consumption (g/kg) under continuous-access conditions was monitored daily for 4 weeks following a single fear-conditioning or control treatment (foot shock and no shock). FPS was assessed three times (once at the end of the 4-week alcohol access period, once at 24 h after removal of alcohol, and once at 6-8 days after removal of alcohol), followed by two more weeks of alcohol access. Results showed no change in alcohol consumption, but alcohol-consuming, fear-conditioned, HAP2 males showed increased FPS at 24 h during the alcohol abstinence period compared to control groups. In experiment 2, alcohol consumption under limited-access conditions was monitored daily for 4 weeks. Fear-conditioning or control treatments occurred four times during the first 12 days and FPS testing occurred four times during the second 12 days of the 4-week alcohol consumption period. Results showed that fear conditioning increased alcohol intake in both HAP2 and LAP2 mice immediately following the first conditioning session. Fear-conditioned HAP2 but not LAP2 mice showed greater alcohol intake compared to control groups on drinking days that occurred between fear conditioning and FPS test sessions. FPS did not change as a function of alcohol consumption in either line. These results in mice help shed light on how a genetic propensity toward high alcohol consumption may be related to the risk for developing PTSD and co-morbid alcohol-use disorders in humans.

Fear conditioning by proxy conserves some of the pathways necessary for direct fear learning (e.g., lateral amygdala) but is unique in that it requires regions necessary for emotional regulation (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex), making this paradigm an important tool for evaluating learning and behavior in the laboratory setting.","[Jones, Carolyn E.; Monfils, Marie-H.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, 108 E Dean Keeton Stop A8000, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Jones, CE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, 108 E Dean Keeton Stop A8000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",carolyn.eagan@gmail.com,,"Monfils, Marie-H./0000-0001-8971-6651", [R01MH091147]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH091147] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Experiments were funded by Grant R01MH091147 to MHM.,,96,37,37,1,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-9448,1435-9456,,ANIM COGN,Anim.

Previous work investigating fear-conditioning in humans has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate that activity patterns representing stimuli from an aversively-conditioned category (CS+) are more similar to each other than those of a neutral category (CS-). Here we used fMRI and multiple aversively-conditioned categories to ask whether we would find only similarity increases within the CS+ categories or also similarity increases between the CS+ categories. Using representational similarity analysis, we correlated several models to activity patterns underlying different brain regions and found that, following fear-conditioning, between-category and within-category similarity increased for the CS+ categories in the insula, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and the right temporal pole. When specifically investigating fear-generalization, these between- and within-category effects were detected in the SFG.

This case study presents an estimation of human health risks for an area that is mainly impacted through air dispersion and deposition from a large-scale metallurgical refinery complex in Zhuzhou city, Hunan Province, China. Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks posed by the contaminants were estimated under future industrial and residential land use scenarios. The result shows that adverse health effects may occur primarily through ingestion of soils contaminated with As, Cd, and Pb. The total carcinogenic risks of multiple contaminants for a large area exceed the acceptable risk level of 1 x 10(-5), and several localized hotspots, where the total hazard index exceeds 1 were identified. Soils in the Tongda site pose the highest carcinogenic risks and non-carcinogenic hazards. It is concluded that potential human health risks exist under the proposed redevelopment scenarios, and development of risk-based remediation strategies is recommended.","[Wei, Jing; Chen, Mengfang; Song, Jing; Luo, Fei; Han, Lu; Li, Chunping; Dong, Mingang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Key Lab Soil Environm & Pollut Remediat, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wei, Jing; Chen, Mengfang; Song, Jing; Luo, Fei; Han, Lu; Dong, Mingang] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Chen, MF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Key Lab Soil Environm & Pollut Remediat, 71 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",mfchen@issas.ac.cn,"Song, Jing/L-8476-2019",,Knowledge Innovative Project of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-BR-19]; Public Wealth Research Funding from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China [201309005]; National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program)National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2013AA06A208],"This work was supported by the Knowledge Innovative Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZCX2-YW-BR-19), the Public Wealth Research Funding from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China (201309005), and the National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) (2013AA06A208).",,36,7,8,9,175,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data on demographically similar women with infection or risk factors for it. RESULTS: Among 1050 women without hysterectomy, squamous intraepithelial lesions were more common among women infected with human immunodeficiency virus than among uninfected women (18.8% vs 5.3%; P <.001). In multivariate analysis the association of squamous intraepithelial lesions with human papillomavirus infection was strong; adjusted prevalence ratios were 27 for high-risk, 25 for intermediate-risk, and 10 for low-risk types (95% confidence intervals, 12-58, 12-54, and 4-25, respectively). Much lower adjusted prevalence ratios were seen for the only other factor significantly associated with squamous intraepithelial lesions, namely, infection with human immunodeficiency virus in conjunction with a reduced CD4(+) cell count. Adjusted prevalence ratios were 1.9 for CD4(+) cell counts <200 and 1.6 for CD4(+) cell counts between 200 and 500 (95% confidence intervals, 1.2-3.0 and 1.0-2.5, respectively). Adjusted attributable fractions calculated for this study population indicated that ii both human immunodeficiency virus and human papillomavirus were removed, 47.6% of the observed lesions with atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance and 93.4% of the observed squamous intraepithelial lesions would be prevented. CONCLUSION: Squamous intraepithelial lesions are more common among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women and are associated most commonly with high- and intermediate-risk human papillomavirus types and secondarily with human immunodeficiency virus-associated immune compromise.","Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Yeshiva Univ Albert Einstein Coll Med, Montefiore Med Ctr, New York, NY 10033 USA; Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",,"Duerr, A (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, 4770 Bufford Highway NE, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.",,,,"PHS HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service [U64/CCU206798, U64/CCU306802, U64/CCU106795] Funding Source: Medline",,,26,61,65,1,3,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0002-9378,1097-6868,,AM J OBSTET GYNECOL,Am.

Various measures of fear conditioning co-exist, including different observables and different methods of preprocessing. Here, we first argue that low measurement error is a rational desideratum for any measurement technique. We then show that measurement error can be approximated in benchmark experiments by how closely intended fear memory relates to measured fear memory, a quantity that we term retrodictive validity. From this perspective, we discuss different approaches commonly used to quantify fear conditioning. One of these is psychophysiological modelling (PsPM). This builds on a measurement model that describes how a psychological variable, such as fear memory, influences a physiological measure. This model is statistically inverted to estimate the most likely value of the psychological variable, given the measured data. We review existing PsPMs for skin conductance, pupil size, heart period, respiration, and startle eye-blink. We illustrate the benefit of PsPMs in terms of retrodictive validity and translate this into sample size required to achieve a desired level of statistical power. This sample size can differ up to a factor of three between different observables, and between the best, and the current standard, data pre-processing methods.","[Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Ctr Human Neuroimaging, Max Planck UCL Ctr Computat Psychiat & Ageing Res, 10-12 Russell Sq, London WC1B 5EH, England; [Bach, Dominik R.; Melinscak, Filip] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Computat Psychiat Res, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Bach, DR (corresponding author), UCL, Max Planck UCL Ctr Computat Psychiat & Ageing Res, 10-12 Russell Sq, London WC1B 5EH, England.",d.bach@ucl.ac.uk; filip.melinscak@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik/B-4302-2019","Bach, Dominik/0000-0003-3717-2036; Melinscak, Filip/0000-0001-8767-358X",European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2018 CoG-816564]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [203147/Z/16/Z],DRB is supported by funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. ERC-2018 CoG-816564 ActionContraThreat).

In the last years there has been a growing interest on conditioned fear memory reconsolidation and extinction, two specific phases of memorization process, both induced by memory retrieval. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these two mnemonic processes may allow to work out therapeutic interventions for treatment of human fear and anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Based on the use of one-trial conditioning paradigms, which allow to follow the evolution of a mnemonic trace in its various phases, the present paper has attempted to reorganize the current literature relative to the rodents highlighting both the role of several brain structures in conditioned fear memory reconsolidation and extinction and the selective cellular processes involved. A crucial role seems to be play by medial prefrontal cortex, in particular by prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and by distinct connections between them and the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

In humans it is linked to fear-related disorders such as phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD)(3,4). Fear memories can be reduced by counter-conditioning, in which fear conditioned stimuli CS+s) are repeatedly reinforced with reward(5) or with novel non-threatening stimuli(6). However, this procedure involves explicit presentations of CS+s, which is itself aversive before fear is successfully reduced. This aversiveness may be a problem when trying to translate such experimental paradigms into clinical settings(7). It also raises the fundamental question as to whether explicit presentations of feared objects is necessary for fear reduction(1,8). Although learning without explicit stimulus presentation has been previously demonstrated(9-12), whether fear can be reduced while avoiding explicit exposure to CS+s remains largely unknown. One recently developed approach employs an implicit method to induce learning by reinforcing stimulus-specific neural representations using real-time decoding of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI) signals(13-15) in the absence of stimulus presentation; that is, pairing rewards with the occurrences of multi-voxel brain activity patterns matching a specific stimulus decoded fMRI neurofeedback DecNef)(13,15)). It has been shown that participants exhibit perceptual learning for a specific visual stimulus feature through DecNef, without being given any strategy for the induction of specific neural representations, and without awareness of the content of reinforced neural representations(13). Here we examined whether a similar approach could be applied to counter-conditioning of fear. We show that we can reduce fear towards CS+s by pairing rewards with the activation patterns in visual cortex representing a CS+, while participants remain unaware of the content and purpose of the procedure. This procedure may be an initial step towards novel treatments for fear-related disorders such as phobia and PTSD, via unconscious processing.","[Koizumi, Ai; Cortese, Aurelio; Shibata, Kazuhisa; Kawato, Mitsuo] ATR Computat Neurosci Labs, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback, 2-2-2 Hikaridai,Seika Cho, Kyoto 6190288, Japan; [Koizumi, Ai; Lau, Hakwan] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, 1190 Amsterdam Ave,370 Schermerhorn Extens, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Koizumi, Ai; Amano, Kaoru; Cortese, Aurelio; Yoshida, Wako; Seymour, Ben; Kawato, Mitsuo] NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, 1-4 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Cortese, Aurelio; Kawato, Mitsuo] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan; [Cortese, Aurelio; Lau, Hakwan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Shibata, Kazuhisa] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Psychol, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yoshida, Wako; Seymour, Ben] ATR Cognit Mech Labs, Dept Neural Computat Decis Making, 2-2-2 Hikaridai,Seika Cho, Kyoto 6190288, Japan; [Yoshida, Wako; Seymour, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England; [Lau, Hakwan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Box 951761, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Kawato, M (corresponding author), ATR Computat Neurosci Labs, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback, 2-2-2 Hikaridai,Seika Cho, Kyoto 6190288, Japan.; Kawato, M (corresponding author), NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, 1-4 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.; Kawato, M (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 6300192, Japan.",bjs49@cam.ac.uk; kawato@atr.jp; hakwan@gmail.com,,"Seymour, Ben/0000-0003-1724-5832","'Brain Machine Interface Development' under the Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences - Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); ATR entrust research contract from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology; US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health [R01NS088628]; Wellcome Trust, UKWellcome Trust","We thank K.

However, about one-third of all 236 species are now considered threatened, partially due to the intense human overexploitation. Despite that, to date, no study has explicitly investigated the patterns and processes of extinction and threats of Chinese snakes, or between human exploited and unexploited snake subgroups. We addressed the following three questions: 1) which snake families proportionally include more human exploited species than expected by chance? 2) Which species traits and extrinsic factors are correlated with their extinction risk? 3) Are there differences between human exploited and unexploited species in terms of patterns and processes of extinction? We found that the family Elapidae contained a significantly higher number of exploited species. Considering eight species traits and four extrinsic factors, we performed phylogenetic correlation tests, finding that small geographic range size, large body length, oviparous reproduction, diurnal activity and high human exploitation were important in determining the extinction risk of all Chinese snakes. Moreover, human exploited snakes had a higher percentage of threatened species and large-bodied species than unexploited snakes. Extinction risk of human exploited species was related to body length, reproduction mode and activity period, whereas that of human unexploited species were associated with geographic range size, microhabitat and annual temperature. Overall, we highlight the phylogenetic non-random exploitation of snakes, and different factors underlying species response to human overexploitation. We suggest that conservation priority should be given to exploitation-prone families and species with extinction-prone traits, as identified in this study. Moreover, human exploited and unexploited species should be managed considering different strategies since their extinction risk was associated with different ecological traits. Conservation actions should also focus on preventing human threats, such as human overexploitation and habitat loss, for the effective preservation of Chinese snakes.","[Chen, Chuanwu; Qu, Yanfu; Wang, Yanping] Nanjing Normal Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xianfeng] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Life Informat Sci & Instrument Engn, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Wang, YP (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wangyp214@gmail.com,"Wang, Yanping/AAN-4402-2021; Chen, Chuanwu/AAT-7711-2020","Wang, Yanping/0000-0003-3743-3937; Chen, Chuanwu/0000-0002-3974-853X",,,,76,7,7,9,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,OCT,2019,42,10,,,,,1777,1788,,10.1111/ecog.04374,,,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JD3OF,WOS:000489884000015,,,,,2022-04-16,

Recently, 7-month-old infants have been shown to process facial signs of fear in others without conscious perception and solely on the basis of their eyes. However, it is not known whether unconscious fear processing from eyes is present before 7 months of age or only emerges at around 7 months. To investigate this question, we measured 5-month-old infants' event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to subliminally presented fearful and non-fearful eyes and compared these with 7-month-old infants' ERP responses from a previous study. Our ERP results revealed that only 7-month-olds, but not 5-month-olds, distinguished between fearful and non-fearful eyes. Specifically, 7-month-olds' processing of fearful eyes was reflected in early visual processes over occipital cortex and later attentional processes over frontal cortex. This suggests that, in line with prior work on the conscious detection of fearful faces, the brain processes associated with the unconscious processing of fearful eyes develop between 5 and 7 months of age. More generally, these findings support the notion that emotion perception and the underlying brain processes undergo critical change during the first year of life. Therefore, the current data provide further evidence for viewing infancy as a formative period in human socioemotional functioning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The endocannabinoid anandamide is degraded by the catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Anandamide is implicated in the mediation of fear behaviors, including fear extinction, suggesting that selectively elevating brain anandamide could modulate plastic changes in fear. Here we first tested this hypothesis with preclinical experiments employing a novel, potent and selective FAAH inhibitor, AM3506 (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pentanesulfonyl fluoride). Systemic AM3506 administration before extinction decreased fear during a retrieval test in a mouse model of impaired extinction. AM3506 had no effects on fear in the absence of extinction training, or on various non-fear-related measures. Anandamide levels in the basolateral amygdala were increased by extinction training and augmented by systemic AM3506, whereas application of AM3506 to amygdala slices promoted long-term depression of inhibitory transmission, a form of synaptic plasticity linked to extinction. Further supporting the amygdala as effect-locus, the fear-reducing effects of systemic AM3506 were blocked by intra-amygdala infusion of a CB1 receptor antagonist and were fully recapitulated by intra-amygdala infusion of AM3506. On the basis of these preclinical findings, we hypothesized that variation in the human FAAH gene would predict individual differences in amygdala threat-processing and stress-coping traits. Consistent with this, carriers of a low-expressing FAAH variant (385A allele; rs324420) exhibited quicker habituation of amygdala reactivity to threat, and had lower scores on the personality trait of stress-reactivity. Our findings show that augmenting amygdala anandamide enables extinction-driven reductions in fear in mouse and may promote stress-coping in humans.","[Gunduz-Cinar, O.; MacPherson, K.

With system approach in management and strategy, human risk factor as input has considerable potential to change results as airworthiness in aviation management. The managers of aviation business also optimize their functions to act safe while making contribution to development in triple of sustainability as economic development and its sustainability; social development and its sustainability; and environmental development and its sustainability. Corporate sustainability can be accomplished via supporting workforce which is the human risk factor. To support (empowerment) workforce, researchers should identify human risk or error factors which are important to this research. The purpose of this study is to suggest holistic framework for working environment system of aircraft maintenance technicians (AMTs) within two respects such as human performance (ergonomics) and corporate performance (sustainability). The secondary purpose of this system is to develop human risk taxonomy by determining the factors affecting both human and work by taking ergonomic aspects in aviation. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a taxonomy of human risk factors for AMTs is developed. These human factors divided into groups and subfactors are obtained from an extensive literature review and experts' opinions in the field of human performance in aviation. Taxonomy developed will be useful to both sharing and using corporate sources in sustainable way. Findings Human risk factors can be considered or accepted as factors that cause human error. This may result in the optimum way to managing human risk factor via minimizing human-based error. Personality, hazardous attitudes, individual characteristics, physical/psychological condition of AMTs and corporate social responsibility factors are human-related risk variables in this study. The risks and error can be reduced by recognizing these factors and revealing their relation to ergonomic design. Originality/value The results of this study are intended to constitute a guide for managers to manage risk factors and to take corrective and preventive actions for their maintenance operations. It is believed that this study is highly important for the aviation sector in terms of raising awareness or providing awareness for similar practices. As taxonomy of the risk factors contributes to the managing human error, corrective actions related to these factors must be taken by managers.","[Yazgan, Ebru] Anadolu Univ, Fac Aeronaut & Astronaut, Dept Airframe & Powerplant Maintenance, Eskisehir, Turkey",,"Yazgan, E (corresponding author), Anadolu Univ, Fac Aeronaut & Astronaut, Dept Airframe & Powerplant Maintenance, Eskisehir, Turkey.",eyazgan@anadolu.edu.tr,"yazgan, ebru/ABF-4871-2020; YAZGAN, EBRU/AAA-7207-2022","yazgan, ebru/0000-0002-6545-8536; ",,,,51,9,9,7,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-8842,1758-4213,,AIRCR ENG AEROSP TEC,Aircr.

This view is based primarily on evidence that lesions of the dorsal hippocampus disrupt freezing to contextual cues after fear conditioning. However, lesions that disrupt freezing produce no effect on fear-potentiated startle, a second measure of contextual fear. Moreover, hippocampal lesions also do not disrupt the contextual 'blocking' phenomenon, which provides an indirect measure of contextual fear. In these paradigms, at least, it appears that hippocampal lesions disrupt the expression of freezing, rather than contextual fear itself. This interpretation is supported by the finding that rats showing preserved contextual blocking after hippocampal lesions show deficits not only in contextual freezing, but also in unconditioned freezing. These findings are consistent with a growing body of data from other conditioning paradigms that contextual learning is spared after lesions of the dorsal hippocampus. Nonetheless, there remain some reports of impaired contextual fear conditioning after hippocampal lesions that cannot be attributed easily to a disruption of freezing. Thus, it is concluded that the hippocampus may be involved in contextual learning under certain - as yet, unspecified - circumstances, but is not critical for contextual learning in general.

The extent and correlates of these concerns are examined using survey data from the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Borrowing from the fear-of-crime literature, the contact hypothesis, and group threat theory, several hypotheses are developed linking discrimination fear to direct personal experience with discrimination, indirect or vicarious experience, and environmental signals of discrimination. Results show that about half of Blacks and Hispanics have feared discrimination in the past year. Multivariate results indicate that fear is most likely if one has experienced victimization first-hand and when one's parent is affected by discrimination. Further, a larger presence neighborhood outgroups produces greater fear. Overall, discrimination fear constitutes an additional obstacle for minority adolescents as they transition to adulthood. The phenomenon warrants increased scholarly attention and represents a fruitful avenue for future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Design: a prospective study of falls over a 2-year period (1991-92). Falls were ascertained using bimonthly postcards plus telephone interview with a standardized (World Health Organisation) questionnaire for circumstances, fear of falling and consequences of each reported fall, Each participant underwent a physical exam and subjective health assessment each year from 1990 to 1993. Setting: New-Mexico Aging Process Study, USA. Subjects: 487 elderly subjects (> 60 years) Living independently in the community. Main outcome measures: fear of falling after experiencing a fall. Results: 70 (32%) of 219 subjects who experienced a fall during the 2 year study period reported a fear of falling. Women were more likely than men to report fear of falling (74% vs 26%), Fallers who were afraid of falling again had significantly more balance (31.9% vs 12.8%) and gait disorders (31.9% vs 7.4%) at entry in the study in 1990, Among sex, age, mental status, balance and gait abnormalities, economic resource and physical health, logistic regression analysis show gait abnormalities and poor self-perception of physical health, cognitive status and economic resources to be significantly associated with fear of falling. Subjects who reported a fear of falling experienced a greater increase in balance (P = 0.08), gait (P < 0.01) and cognitive disorders (P = 0.09) over time, resulting in a decrease in mobility level. Conclusion: the study indicated that about one-third of elderly people develop a fear of falling after an incident fall and this issue should be specifically addressed in any rehabilitation programme.","UNIV NEW MEXICO,SCH MED,CTR POPULAT HLTH,CLIN NUTR PROGRAM,ALBUQUERQUE,NM 87131; CHU PURPAN,COLLABORAT CTR PROMOTE SAFETY AGED INDIVIDUALS,WHO,DEPT INTERNAL MED & GERONTOL,TOULOUSE,FRANCE",,,,,,"NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [HL36158] Funding Source: Medline; NIA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [AGO2049, AG10149] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL036158] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R01AG010149, R37AG002049, R55AG002049, R01AG002049] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,17,529,541,1,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0002-0729,,,AGE AGEING,Age Ageing,MAY,1997,26,3,,,,,189,193,,10.1093/ageing/26.3.189,,,5,Geriatrics & Gerontology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geriatrics & Gerontology,XH112,WOS:A1997XH11200006,9223714,Bronze,,,2022-04-16,

Interfering with such memories in humans would be of high clinical relevance. On the basis of studies in cell cultures and slice preparations, it is hypothesised that synaptic remodelling required for threat learning involves the extracellular enzyme matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9. However, in vivo evidence for this proposal is lacking. Here we investigate human Pavlovian fear conditioning under the blood-brain barrier crossing MMP inhibitor doxycyline in a pre-registered, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We find that recall of threat memory, measured with fear-potentiated startle 7 days after acquisition, is attenuated by similar to 60% in individuals who were under doxycycline during acquisition. This threat memory impairment is also reflected in increased behavioural surprise signals to the conditioned stimulus during subsequent re-learning, and already late during initial acquisition. Our findings support an emerging view that extracellular signalling pathways are crucially required for threat memory formation. Furthermore, they suggest novel pharmacological methods for primary prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder.","[Bach, D.

Here we begin with an overview of the LC-NE system. We then consider how both direct and indirect manipulations of the LC-NE system affect cued and contextual aversive learning and memory. We propose that NE dynamically modulates Pavlovian conditioning and extinction, either promoting or impairing learning aversive processes under different levels of behavioral arousal. We suggest that under high levels of stress (e.g., during/soon after fear conditioning) the locus coeruleus (LC) promotes cued fear learning by enhancing amygdala function while simultaneously blunting prefrontal function. Under low levels of arousal, the LC promotes PFC function to promote downstream inhibition of the amygdala and foster the extinction of cued fear. Thus, LC-NE action on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) might be described by an inverted-U function such that it can either enhance or hinder learning depending on arousal states. In addition, LC-NE seems to be particularly important for the acquisition, consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memories. This may be due to dense adrenoceptor expression in the hippocampus (HPC) which encodes contextual information, and the ability of NE to regulate long-term potentiation (LTP). Moreover, recent work reveals that the diversity of LC-NE functions in aversive learning and memory are mediated by functionally heterogeneous populations of LC neurons that are defined by their projection targets. Hence, LC-NE function in learning and memory is determined by projection-specific neuromodulation that accompanies various states of behavioral arousal.","[Giustino, Thomas F.; Maren, Stephen] Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M Inst Neurosci, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,"Maren, S (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M Inst Neurosci, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",maren@tamu.edu,"Maren, Stephen/B-6182-2014","Maren, Stephen/0000-0002-9342-7411","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01MH065961, F31MH112208]; McKnight Foundation Memory and Cognitive Disorders Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH065961, F31MH112208] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01MH065961 to SM and F31MH112208 to TFG).

We examined in adult male rats the relationship between conditioned fear extinction learning, circadian phase, and endogenous glucocorticoids (CORT). Rats maintained on a 12 h light:dark cycle were trained and tested across 3 separate daily sessions (conditioned fear acquisition and 2 extinction sessions) that were administered during either the rats' active or inactive circadian phase. In an initial experiment we found that rats at both circadian phases acquired and extinguished auditory cue conditioned fear to a similar degree in the first extinction session. However, rats trained and tested at zeitgeber time-16 (ZT16) (active phase) showed enhanced extinction memory expression during the second extinction session compared to rats trained and tested at ZT4 (inactive phase). In a follow-up experiment, adrenalectomized (ADX) or sham surgery rats were similarly trained and tested across 3 separate daily sessions at either ZT4 or ZT16. ADX had no effect on conditioned fear acquisition or conditioned fear memory. Sham ADX rats trained and tested at ZT16 exhibited better extinction learning across the two extinction sessions compared to all other groups of rats. These results indicate that conditioned fear extinction learning is modulated by time of day, and this diurnal modulation requires the presence of adrenal hormones. These results support an important role of CORT-dependent circadian processes in regulating conditioned fear extinction learning, which may be capitalized upon to optimize effective treatment of PTSD.

Simultaneously regressing FOPQ subscales fear of pain and activity avoidance on theorized construct validity measures demonstrated that fear of pain was more closely linked with anxiety sensitivity and pain catastrophizing while activity avoidance had a strong negative association with pain acceptance (activity engagement and pain willingness). Pain-related fear was not significantly associated with pain level. After controlling for demographic factors and pain, fear of pain and activity avoidance accounted for an additional 26% of the variance in functional disability and school functioning outcomes, with activity avoidance accounting for much of this relationship. Conclusions: Although typically considered an influential construct among musculoskeletal patients, pain-related fear is also an important factor influencing functioning among pediatric headache patients, with the dimension of activity avoidance particularly salient.","[Simons, Laura E.; Pielech, Melissa; Cappucci, Stefanie; Lebel, Alyssa] Boston Childrens Hosp, Div Pain Med, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simons, Laura E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Simons, LE (corresponding author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Pain Treatment Serv, 21 Autumn St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",Laura.Simons@childrens.harvard.edu,,"Simons, Laura E./0000-0002-3395-9483","National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [K23HD067202]; Sara Page Mayo Endowment for Pediatric Pain Research and Treatment; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine at Children's Hospital Boston; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [K23HD067202] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant K23HD067202 (LS), the Sara Page Mayo Endowment for Pediatric Pain Research and Treatment, and the Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine at Children's Hospital Boston.",,38,25,25,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0333-1024,1468-2982,,CEPHALALGIA,Cephalalgia,JAN,2015,35,1,,,,,36,44,,10.1177/0333102414534084,,,9,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,AW3TE,WOS:000346208200004,24812036,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-16,

Methods: We examined predictors of FOF among community-dwelling older adults using data from two longitudinal randomized controlled trials that implemented fall prevention programs for community-dwelling older adults. Results: Two hundred fifty-nine participants were included in the analysis; 145 reported low FOF, while 59 reported high FOF. After controlling for mobility performance, ADL independence, and sociodemographic factors, Black older adults were more likely to report FOF (OR = 2.17) compared to White older adults. Overall, older adults with lower mobility performance/functioning scores were more likely to have FOF (OR = 0.08). Conclusions: Older adults (aged >= 65 years) who are at higher risk, based on a prior history of fall(s), are more susceptible to developing FOF, as evidenced by the older adults within this study, due to limited mobility performance and functioning. Clinical Implications: Black older adults may be at greater risk of FOF than their White counterparts based on previous fall history and level of functional mobility. Incorporating measures of objective performance-based function along with measures of psychological factors are viable methods to identify and address FOF within Black older adult populations.","[Washington, Selena E.] St Louis Univ, Dept Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Hlth Sci Ctr, St Louis, MO USA; [Snyder, Makenna; Stark, Susan L.] Washington Univ, Program Occupat Therapy, Sch Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Hu, Yi-Ling] Wayne State Univ, Inst Gerontol, Eugene Applebaum Coll Pharm & Hlth Sci, Detroit, MI USA",,"Stark, SL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Program Occupat Therapy, Sch Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",peplab@wustl.edu,,"Stark, Susan/0000-0002-2816-7158; Washington, Selena/0000-0002-1686-4802","U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [MOHHU0024,MOLHH0196-09]; National Institute of AgingUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [1R01AG057680-01A1]","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [MOHHU0024,MOLHH0196-09], National Institute of Aging, [1R01AG057680-01A1].",,37,0,0,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0731-7115,1545-2301,,CLIN GERONTOLOGIST,Clin.

A three-stage stratified clustered sample of the Australian adult population completed a computer-assisted telephone interview followed by a clinical examination. Oral health measures were the DMFT index and its components, periodontitis and gingivitis. A total of 5364 adults aged 18-91 years were dentally examined. Higher dental fear was significantly associated with more decayed teeth (DT), missing teeth (MT) and DMFT. There was an inverted 'U' association between dental fear and the number of filled teeth (FT). Periodontitis and gingivitis were not associated with dental fear. The association between dental fear and DMFT was significant for adults aged 18-29 and 30-44 years, but not in older ages. Dental fear was significantly associated with more DT, MT, and DMFT but with fewer FT after controlling for age, sex, income, employment status, tertiary education, dental insurance status and oral hygiene. This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting results of previous studies and establishes that dental fear is associated with more decayed and missing teeth but fewer FT. That people with higher dental fear have significantly more caries experience underlines the importance of identifying and then reducing dental fear as important steps in improving adult oral health.","[Armfield, Jason M.; Slade, Gary D.; Spencer, A.

On the level of cellular signaling, regulator of G protein signaling 2 (Rgs2) has been implicated in human and rodent anxiety. However, there is limited knowledge about the role of Rgs2 in fear learning and reactivity to stress. In this study, Rgs2(-/-) mice showed increased fear learning, male mice displayed increased contextual and cued fear learning, while females showed selectively enhanced cued fear learning. Male Rgs2(-/-) mice displayed increased long-term-contextual fear memory, but increased cued fear extinction. Learning in spatial non-aversive paradigms was also increased in Rgs2(-/-) mice. Female, but not male mice show increased spatial learning in the Barnes maze, while male mice showed enhanced place preference in the IntelliCage, rendering enhanced cognitive function non-specific for aversive stimuli. Consistent with the previous results, Rgs2 deletion resulted in increased innate anxiety, including neophobic behavior expressed as hypolocomotion, in three different tests based on the approach-avoidance conflict. Acute electric foot shock stress provoked hypolocomotion in several exploration-based tests, suggesting fear generalization in both genotypes. Rgs2 deletion was associated with reduced monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and disturbed corresponding GPCR expression of the adrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and neuropeptide Y system. Taken together, Rgs2 deletion promotes improved cognitive function as well as increased anxiety-like behavior, but has no effect on acute stress reactivity. These effects may be related to the observed disruption of the monoaminergic systems.","[Raab, A.; Hommers, L.] Univ Hosp Wurzburg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Clin Res, Wurzburg, Germany; [Raab, A.; Lesch, K-P.; Lohse, M.

Initial research has reported that the single presentation of a conditioned stimulus prior to extinction learning can permanently block the return of fear. However, only few studies have explored this issue and could not always replicate the findings. The present study examined human fear extinction using a four-day design. On the first day, two neutral stimuli were paired with electrical stimulation (UCS), while a third stimulus (CS-) was not. Twenty-four hours later, one conditioned stimulus (CS+(rem)) and the CS- were reminded once, 10 min before extinction learning, while the other conditioned stimulus (CS+(non-rem)) was not presented prior to extinction learning. All stimuli were presented during extinction learning and during two re-extinction sessions (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) without reinforcement. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses and skin conductance responses (SCRs) to both CS+ and the CS- were explored during acquisition, extinction, and in both re-extinction sessions. Regarding SCRs, the results showed that a single presentation of a conditioned stimulus did not block the return of fear during re-extinction: Fear recovery during re-extinction (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) was observed for both CS+ compared with the CS- with no difference between CS+(rem) and CS+(non-rem). Regarding BOLD-responses, no significant differences between CS+(rem) and CS+(non-rem) were found in region of interest (ROI)-analyses (amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) during extinction learning and both re-extinction sessions. Whole-brain analyses showed increased BOLD-responses to the CS+(non-rem) as compared to the CS+(rem) in several regions (e.g., middle frontal gyrus) during extinction learning and re-extinction (24 h after extinction learning). The present findings suggest that the effect of preventing the return of fear by disrupting reconsolidation seems to be a more labile phenomenon than previously assumed. Possible boundary conditions and implications are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to replicate and extend previous work examining whether social anxiety is a risk factor for AUD by evaluating both the temporal antecedence and non-spuriousness of this relationship. We also examined whether social anxiety first-order factors (social interaction anxiety, observation anxieties) served as specific predictors of AUD. A non-referred sample of 404 psychologically healthy young adults (i.e. free from current or past Axis I psychopathology) was prospectively followed over approximately two years. Social anxiety (but not depression or trait anxiety) at baseline significantly predicted subsequent AUD onset. The relationship between social anxiety and AUD remained even after controlling for relevant variables (gender, depression, trait anxiety). Further, social anxiety first-order factors differentially predicted AUD onset, such that observation anxieties (but not social interaction anxiety) were prospectively linked to AUD onset. This study provides further support that social anxiety (and fear of scrutiny specifically) appears to serve as an important and potentially specific AUD-related variable that deserves serious attention as a potential vulnerability factor.

All consenting patients had a root filling or were treatment planned to have one. The survey by Ost & Hugdahl () on anxiety response patterns was modified and used. Data were presented using descriptive statistics, tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and analysed with nonparametric anova (Kruskal-Wallis) and post hoc test. ResultsCognitive conditioning and parental pathways seem to be the primary cause (P<0.05) of fear and anxiety with root canal treatment. Females were significantly more likely to be influenced by indirect conditioned experiences such as informative, parental, verbal threat and vicarious pathways. ConclusionThe origin of patients' fears requires more attention in terms of treating endodontic-related fear and anxiety.

However, it is undetermined if IL depression was mediated by the cued or contextual information. The objective of this study was to examine whether contextual information was sufficient to depress IL neuronal excitability. After exposing rats to context-alone, pseudoconditioning, or contextual fear conditioning, we used whole-cell current-clamp recordings to examine the excitability of IL neurons in prefrontal brain slices. We found that contextual fear conditioning reduced IL neuronal firing in response to depolarizing current steps. In addition, neurons from contextual fear conditioned animals showed increased slow afterhyperpolarization potentials (sAHPs). Moreover, the observed changes in IL excitability correlated with contextual fear expression, suggesting that IL depression may contribute to the encoding of contextual fear. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although these studies provide a strong link between exercise and learning, to date studies have largely focused on tasks that principally involve the hippocampus. However, exercise has been shown to produce alterations in other brain areas suggesting that the cognitive enhancing effects of exercise may be more general. Therefore we set out to examine the effects of voluntary exercise on cued Pavlovian fear conditioning, a form of learning that is critically dependent on the amygdala. In Experiment 1 we showed that mice given 2 weeks of access to a running wheel prior to tone and foot shock fear conditioning showed enhanced conditioned fear as measured by fear-potentiated startle. This effect was not the result of altered shock reactivity nor was it to due to reduced baseline startle amplitude in exercising mice. In subsequent experiments we sought to examine whether the enhanced cued conditioned fear was the result of an improvement in learning, consolidation or retrieval of conditioned fear. In separate groups of mice, two weeks of access to a running wheel was begun either prior to fear conditioning, immediately after fear conditioning (consolidation period) or 2 weeks after fear conditioning. Compared to sedentary mice, mice that exercised either prior to fear conditioning, or immediately after fear conditioning, showed enhanced cued conditioned fear. Fear conditioning was not enhanced in mice that began exercising 2 weeks after fear conditioning. Taken together these results suggest that voluntary exercise improves the learning and consolidation of cued conditioned fear but does not improve the retrieval or performance of conditioned fear. Because a great deal is known about the neural circuit for cued conditioned fear, it is now possible to examine the cellular, molecular and pharmacological changes associated with exercise in this well-understood neural circuit.

In the laboratory, associative learning paradigms that pair aversive with neutral stimuli are used as analogues to real-life fear learning. These studies use physiological indices, such as skin conductance, to sensitively measure rates and intensity of learning and extinction. In this review, we discuss some of the potential limitations in interpreting and analysing physiological data during the acquisition or extinction of conditioned fear. We argue that the utmost attention should be paid to the development of modelling approaches of physiological data in associative learning paradigms, by illustrating the lack of replicability and interpretability of results in current methods. We also show that statistical significance may be easily achieved in this paradigm without more stringent data and data analysis reporting requirements, leaving this particular field vulnerable to misleading conclusions. This review is written so that issues and potential solutions are accessible to researchers without mathematical training. We conclude the review with some suggestions that all laboratories should be able to implement, including visualising the full data set in publications and adopting modelling, or at least regression-based, approaches.","[Ney, L.

Quantitative results demonstrate that the highest risks during the drilling process include being struck by an object, injury by machine, and overexertion; conversely, the lowest risks include exposure to harmful substances or environments and fire and explosion. The highest risk activities are associated with, for instance, penetration drilling, the trip in and out, and the hoisting and lifting operations. Conversely, the relative lowest risk activities include auxiliary operations, well logging and mud logging, equipment inspection and maintenance. The total risk value of all main drilling activities is 11.3947 S/w-h. Twelve risk control measures were selected, and the Delphi method was taken to quantify the human factor risk mitigation capacity resulting from the selected risk control measures. The results demonstrate that the human risk control measures exist in three tiers of effectiveness, with each tier being separated by nearly an order of magnitude. The types of most risk mitigation are risk codes, such as injury by machine, fall from height, and contact with harmful material. The most minimal risk mitigation types include muscle strain and fire and explosion. Finally, these data will be valuable for drilling companies to strategically allocate limited resources to their safety management plan, and they can evaluate the expected effectiveness resulting from risk control measures.","[Zhou, Aitao; Wang, Kai; Zhang, Hong] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Beijing Key Lab Precise Min Intergrown Energy & R, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kai] China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Coal Resources & Mine Safety, Sch Resource & Safety Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Wang, K (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Resource & Safety Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",safety226@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51774292, 51474219, 51604278]; State Key Research Development Program of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2016YFC0801402, 2016YFC0600708]","Financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51774292, 51474219, 51604278), the State Key Research Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0801402, 2016YFC0600708).",,22,5,5,2,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

Two rounds of literature searches were performed using the PubMed database. Included articles examined DFA, general anxiety/fear, SOR, catastrophizing, and/or oral health behaviors and outcomes in typically developing populations across the lifespan. The relationships between the constructs were recorded and organized into a conceptual model. A total of 188 articles were included. The results provided supporting evidence for relationships between DFA and all other constructs included in the model (general anxiety/fear, SOR, poor oral health, irregular dental attendance, dental behavior management problems [DBMP], and need for treatment with pharmacological methods). Additionally, SOR was associated with general anxiety/fear and DBMP; general anxiety/fear was linked to poor oral health, irregular attendance, and DBMP. This model provides a comprehensive view of the relationships between person factors (e.g., general anxiety/fear, SOR, and DFA) and oral health behaviors and outcomes. This is valuable in order to highlight connections between constructs that may be targeted in the development of new interventions to improve oral health behaviors and outcomes as well as the experience of DFA.","[Stein Duker, Leah I.; Giffin, Willa; Hikita, Natasha] Univ Southern Calif, Herman Ostrow Sch Dent, Mrs TH Chan Div Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Grager, Mollianne] Leaps & Bounds Washington, Seattle, WA 98136 USA; [Polido, Jose C.] Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA",,"Duker, LSI (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Herman Ostrow Sch Dent, Mrs TH Chan Div Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",lstein@chan.usc.edu; mollygrager@gmail.com; wgiffin@usc.edu; nhikita@usc.edu; jpolido@chla.usc.edu,,,National Center for Medical and Rehabilitation Research; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [K12 HD055929]; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [U01 DE024978],"This research was funded by the National Center for Medical and Rehabilitation Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD), grant number K12 HD055929, and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), grant number U01 DE024978.",,284,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In this paper, we re-analyze data from previously reported null result experiments and find that rats showing above-median extinction learning during DCS treatment benefited from the drug, whereas rats showing below-median (and in this case little) extinction learning did not. Two additional experiments found that DCS facilitated extinction learning when specifically combined with a moderate, but not a small, number of extinction trials. DCS thus facilitates extinction learning only if the behavioral procedure first engages the extinction learning process.

However, how THs are involved in the different stages of memory process is little known. Herein, we used hippocampus dependent contextual fear conditioning to address the effects of hippocampal THs on the different stages of fear memory. First, we found that a single systemic levothyroxine (LT4) administration increased the level of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free tetraiodothyroxine (FT4) not only in serum but also in hippocampus. In addition, a single systemic LT4 administration immediately after fear conditioning significantly impaired fear memory. These results indicated the important role of hippocampal THs in fear memory process. To further confirm the effects of hippocampal THs on the different stages of fear memory, LT4 (0.4 mu g/mu l, 1 mu l/side) was injected bilaterally into hippocampus. Rats given LT4 into hippocampus before training or tests had no effect on the acquisition or retrieval of fear memory, however rats given LT4 into hippocampus either immediately or 2 h after training showed being significantly impaired fear memory, which demonstrated LT4 administration into hippocampus impairs the consolidation but has no effect on the acquisition and retrieval of fear memory. Furthermore, hippocampal injection of LT4 did not affect rats' locomotor activity, thigmotaxis and THs level in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and serum. These findings may have important implications for understanding mechanisms underlying contribution of THs to memory disorders.","[Yu, Dafu; Jiang, Yong] First Peoples Hosp Yunnan Prov, Dept Nucl Med, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Dafu; Zhou, Heng; Jiang, Lizhu; Zhou, Qixin; Yang, Yuexiong; Xu, Lin; Mao, Rongrong] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Lab Learning & Memory, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Heng] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zou, Lin] Chongqing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Lab Med, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaoqun] First Peoples Hosp Yunnan Prov, Resp Dept, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lizhu] Dali Univ, Dept Neuropsychopathy, Sch Clin Med, Dali, Peoples R China",,"Xu, L; Mao, RR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Lab Learning & Memory, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",lxu@vip.163.com; talktomaomao@163.com,"Xu, Lin/T-5531-2017; Mao, Rong/Q-2595-2019","Xu, Lin/0000-0002-2710-3507; Mao, Rong/0000-0002-0469-2281; Zhou, Heng/0000-0001-8187-6124","National Basic Research of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB835100, 2015CB553502]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB02020002]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81460216, 31371141, U150222]; Science and Technology Program of Yunnan Province [2013GA003, 2010ZC208]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2013250]; Chinese Human Resources and Social Security Department [508]","This work was supported by National Basic Research of China (2013CB835100 and 2015CB553502), Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB02020002), National Science Foundation of China (81460216, 31371141 and U150222), Science and Technology Program of Yunnan Province (2013GA003 and 2010ZC208), Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2013250), Natural Scientific Research fund (#508 in 2011) of the Chinese Human Resources and Social Security Department.",,51,2,2,3,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5102,,,FRONT CELL NEUROSCI,Front.

Research on fear (extinction) generalization has focused mostly on perceptual similarity, thereby ignoring the importance of conceptual stimulus relations in humans. The present study used a laboratory procedure to create de novo conceptual categories of arbitrary stimuli and investigated fear and extinction generalization among these stimuli. A matching-to-sample task produced two four-member categories of abstract figures. Next, a member from one category was coupled with an aversive electrical stimulation, while a member from the other category was presented alone. As expected, conditioned fear responses generalized to the other members of the first category (skin conductance and online shock-expectancy). Subsequent extinction of the conditioned member also generalized to the other members. However, extinguishing a non-conditioned member failed to reduce fear of the conditioned member itself. We conclude that fears generalize readily across conceptually related stimuli, but that the degree of extinction generalization depends on the stimulus subjected to extinction.","[Vervoort, Ellen; Vervliet, Bram; Bennett, Marc; Baeyens, Frank] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Louvain, Belgium",,"Vervoort, E (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Louvain, Belgium.",ellen.vervoort@ppw.kuleuven.be,"Vervliet, Bram/AAE-6276-2019","Vervliet, Bram/0000-0002-5904-4257",KU Leuven Research FundKU Leuven; KU Leuven Centre for Excellence grant [PF/10/005],"This research was supported by a PhD scholarship of the KU Leuven Research Fund, and by a KU Leuven Centre for Excellence grant PF/10/005.

Our objectives were to determine the temporal relationship between falls and fear of falling, and to see whether these two outcomes share predictors. DESIGN: A 20-month, population-based, prospective, observational study. SETTING: Salisbury, Maryland. Each evaluation consisted of a home-administered questionnaire, followed by a 4- to 5-hour clinic evaluation. PARTICIPANTS: The 2,212 participants in the Salisbury Eye Evaluation project who had baseline and 20-month follow-up clinic evaluations. At baseline, subjects were aged 65 to 84 and community dwelling and had a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 18 or higher. MEASUREMENTS: Demographics, visual function, comorbidities, neuropsychiatric status, medication use, and physical performance-based measures were assessed. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate independent predictors of falls and fear of falling at the follow-up evaluation, first predicting incident outcomes and then predicting fall or fear-of-falling status at 20 months with baseline falling and fear of falling as predictors. RESULTS: Falls at baseline were an independent predictor of developing fear of falling 20 months later (odds ratio (OR) = 1.75; P < .0005), and fear of falling at baseline was a predictor of falling at 20 months (OR = 1.79; P < .0005). Women with a history of stroke were at risk of falls and fear of falling at follow-up. In addition, Parkinson's disease, comorbidity, and white race predicted falls, whereas General Health Questionnaire score, age, and taking four or more medications predicted fear of falling. CONCLUSION: Individuals who develop one of these outcomes are at risk for developing the other, with a resulting spiraling risk of falls, fear of falling, and functional decline. Because falls and fear of falling share predictors, individuals who are at a high risk of developing these endpoints can be identified.","Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Rochester, NY USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dana Ctr Prevent Ophthalmol, Baltimore, MD USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD USA; Inst Ophthalmol, London, England",,"Friedman, SM (corresponding author), Highland Hosp, 1000 South Ave,Box 58, Rochester, NY 14620 USA.",susan_friedman@urmc.rochester.edu,,,"NIA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [1K23AG01002-01, AG10184] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P01AG010184] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,38,606,629,2,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8614,1532-5415,,J AM GERIATR SOC,J.

Our group has shown that fear inhibition is impaired in both combat and civilian PTSD populations. On the basis of our earlier findings, we employed an established fear extinction paradigm to further explore fear dysregulation in a civilian traumatized population. Methods: Fear-potentiated startle (FPS) was examined in 127 trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD. We used a protocol in which conditioned fear was first acquired through the presentation of one colored shape (reinforced conditioned stimulus, [CS+]) that was paired with an aversive air blast to the larynx (unconditioned stimulus) and a different colored shape that was not paired to the air blast (nonreinforced condition stimulus). Fear was extinguished 10 min later through repeated presentations of the CSs without reinforcement. Results: Both groups demonstrated successful fear conditioning on the basis of startle and unconditioned stimulus-expectancy ratings; however, participants with PTSD displayed greater FPS responses to the CS+ and non reinforced conditioned stimulus compared with the group without PTSD. During fear extinction, the PTSD group showed elevated FPS responses to the previously reinforced CS+ during the early and middle stages of extinction. During the acquisition and extinction phases, PTSD participants with higher levels of reexperiencing symptoms exhibited greater potentiated startle responses to the CS+ compared with PTSD participants with lower reexperiencing symptoms. Conclusions: These results suggest that PTSD is associated with enhanced fear learning and a greater fear load to extinguish after conditioned fear is acquired.","[Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja; Olin, Ilana W.; Sands, Lauren A.; Karapanou, India; Bradley, Bekh; Ressler, Kerry J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Olin, Ilana W.; Bradley, Bekh; Ressler, Kerry J.] Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Decatur, GA USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.] Yerkes Natl Primate Res Ctr, Atlanta, GA USA; [Ressler, Kerry J.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Bethesda, MD 20817 USA",,"Norrholm, SD (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",snorrho@emory.edu,"Bradley, Bekh/H-8399-2012; Ressler, Kerry J/N-8741-2018; Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022","Ressler, Kerry J/0000-0002-5158-1103; McCarthy, Ilana/0000-0002-3305-2478","National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD)French National Research Agency (ANR)NARSAD; Department of Defense/Congressionally Directed Medical Research ProgramUnited States Department of Defense [W81XWH-08-2-0170]; Emory University Research Committee; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [UL1 RR025008]; National Center for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR); National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32 MH070129, MH071537]; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention; National Centers for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [M01 RR00039]; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and DepressionNARSAD; Burroughs Wellcome FoundationBurroughs Wellcome Fund; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000454] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [M01RR000039, UL1RR025008] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R56MH071537, R01MH071537, F32MH070129] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Dr. Norrholm has research support from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD), the Department of Defense/Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (Award # W81XWH-08-2-0170), the Emory University Research Committee and PHS Grant (UL1 RR025008) from the Clinical and Translational Science Award program, National Institutes of Health, and National Center for Research Resources.

The persistence of increased resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala has been a critical finding in patients with stress and anxiety disorders. However, longitudinal changes in amygdala rsFC have rarely been explored in healthy participants. To address this issue, we studied the rsFC of the amygdala in two groups of healthy volunteers. The control group participated in three FMRI scanning sessions of their resting state at the first visit, one day, and one week later. The experimental group participated in three fMRI sessions on the first day: a resting state before fear conditioning, a fear extinction session, and a resting state immediately after fear extinction. Furthermore, this group experienced scanning after one day and week. The fear-conditioning paradigm consisted of visual stimuli with a distinct rate of partial reinforcement by electric shock. During the extinction, we presented the same stimuli in another sequence without aversive pairing. In the control group, rsFC maps were statistically similar between sessions for the left and right amygdala. However, in the experimental group, the increased rsFC mainly of the left amygdala was observed after extinction, one day, and one week. The between-group comparison also demonstrated an increase in the left amygdala rsFC in the experimental group. Our results indicate that functional connections of the left amygdala influenced by fear learning may persist for several hours and days in the human brain.","[Martynova, Olga; Tetereva, Alina; Balaev, Vladislav; Portnova, Galina; Ivanitsky, Alexey] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Higher Nervous Act & Neurophysiol, 5a Butlerova Str, Moscow 117485, Russia; [Martynova, Olga] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Ctr Cognit & Decis Making, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Portnova, Galina] Pushkin State Russian Language Inst, 6 Ak Volgina Str, Moscow 117483, Russia; [Ushakov, Vadim] Natl Res Ctr, Kurchatov Inst, 1 Ak Kurchatova Pl, Moscow 123182, Russia",,"Martynova, O (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Higher Nervous Act, 5A Butlerova, Moscow 117484, Russia.",omartynova@ihna.ru,"Martynova, Olga V/K-3900-2012; Tetereva, Alina O/E-7282-2014","Martynova, Olga V/0000-0001-9047-2893; Tetereva, Alina O/0000-0003-2077-628X",Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [16-15-00300]; Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [19-15-11022] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,The Russian Science Foundation supported this work (Project No. 16-15-00300).,,63,2,2,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8760,1872-7697,,INT J PSYCHOPHYSIOL,Int.

EEG was recorded during resting baseline, as well as during stranger approach, mask presentation, and toy spider presentation. Mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. For mask presentation, baseline and task right frontal EEG asymmetry as well as maternal ratings predicted fear behavior during the mask task. For stranger approach, task-related right frontal EEG asymmetry predicted fear behavior during stranger approach after controlling for baseline asymmetry. There was a trend for task-related right frontal EEG asymmetry to predict fear during presentation of a toy spider after controlling for baseline asymmetry.

Human error prediction can be beneficial to assess risk in maritime industry since shipping activities can pose potential hazards to human life and maritime ecology. The aim of this paper is to propose a risk assessment tool by considering the role of human factor. Hence, the desired safety control level in maritime transportation activities can be ascertained. In the proposed approach, a Success Likelihood Index Method (SLIM) extended with fuzzy logic is used to calculate human error probability (HEP). Severity of consequences are adopted in the proposed approach to assess risk. The quantitative risk assessment approach under fuzzy SLIM methodology will be applied to a very specific case on-board ship: Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) system. In order to improve consistency of research and minimize subjectivity of experts' judgments, the paper adopts the dominance factor which is used to adjust the impact level of experts' judgments in the aggregation stage of the methodology. The paper aims at not only highlighting the importance of human factor in maritime risk assessment but also enhancing safety control level and minimizing potential environmental impacts to marine ecology.","[Akyuz, Emre] Bursa Tech Univ, Dept Maritime Management, TR-16330 Yildirim, Bursa, Turkey; [Celik, Erkan] Munzur Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tunceli, Turkey",,"Akyuz, E (corresponding author), Bursa Tech Univ, Dept Maritime Management, TR-16330 Yildirim, Bursa, Turkey.",emreakyuz82@gmail.com,"Celik, Erkan/O-1075-2013; Akyuz, Emre/L-9543-2018; Akyuz, Emre/ABB-1245-2020","Celik, Erkan/0000-0003-4465-0913; Akyuz, Emre/0000-0002-0071-9619; Akyuz, Emre/0000-0002-0071-9619",,,,38,13,13,6,37,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Being chemically similar to calcium, radium concentrates mostly in bones, shells, and exoskeletons. Previous studies have been based on the whole-body bioaccumulation of radium in fish where the distribution of radium in bone/exoskeleton and the edible parts of fish were not considered separately and thus the predicted risks were relatively high. In this article, the distribution of radium in the non-edible and edible parts of fish and the probability of exposure to a produced water plume have been studied in order to characterize human health risks. A probabilistic hydrodynamic model has been incorporated in this study. Using the concentration distribution approach, the mean cancer risks to humans were predicted in the range of 8.6 x 10(-7) to 9.5 x 10(-7), which were 2.6 to 2.7 times less than the risks predicted by using the whole body concentrations. The exceedence probability of maximum permissible human health cancer risk of 1 x 10(-7) is close to zero. At a risk level of 1 x 10(-6), the exceedence probability is 21 % whereas in the whole body concentration approach it is between 45 to 49%.

To understand the biological mechanisms of fear dysregulation in PTSD, it is important to start with a valid animal model of the disorder. This protocol describes the methodology required to conduct stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) experiments, a preclinical model of PTSD, in both rats and mice. SEFL was developed to recapitulate critical aspects of PTSD, including long-term sensitization of fear learning caused by an acute stressor. SEFL uses aspects of Pavlovian fear conditioning but produces a distinct and robust sensitized fear response far greater than normal conditional fear responses. The trauma procedure involves placing a rodent in a conditioning chamber and administering 15 unsignaled shocks randomly distributed over 90 minutes (for rat experiments; for mouse experiments, 10 unsignaled shocks randomly distributed over 60 minutes are used). On day 2, rodents are placed in a novel conditioning context where they receive a single shock; then, on day 3 they are placed back in the same context as on day 2 and tested for changes in freezing levels. Rodents that previously received the trauma display enhanced levels of freezing on the test day compared to those that received no shocks on the first day. Thus, with this model, a single highly stressful experience (the trauma) produces extreme fear of the stimuli associated with the traumatic event.","[Rajbhandari, Abha K.; Gonzalez, Sarah T.; Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Rajbhandari, Abha K.; Gonzalez, Sarah T.; Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Staglin Ctr Brain & Behav Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Fanselow, MS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.; Fanselow, MS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Staglin Ctr Brain & Behav Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Fanselow, MS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",mfanselow@gmail.com,,,National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01AA026530]; Staglin Center for Brain and Behavioral Health; NARSADNARSAD [26612]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1650604];  [NRSA-F32 MH10721201A1]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062122] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was funded by National Institute of Health R01AA026530 (MSF), Staglin Center for Brain and Behavioral Health (MSF), NRSA-F32 MH10721201A1 and NARSAD 26612 (AKR), and NSF DGE-1650604 (SG).",,17,10,10,1,11,JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,CAMBRIDGE,"1 ALEWIFE CENTER, STE 200, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02140 USA",1940-087X,,,JOVE-J VIS EXP,J.

The assessment of contaminants in fatty fish, an important source of omega-3 fatty acids, is therefore an exercise in balancing risks and benefits. Human health risk assessors and risk managers will benefit from an understanding of the level of uncertainty that is integrated into all aspects of evaluating risk in this context. Significant variability exists in the way in which analyses are conducted, how data are reported, and how they are used in risk assessments. We conducted an analytical review of PCB and PBDE data in farmed and wild salmon, and identified critical issues having implications on human health risk assessment from fish consumption. These issues include: analytical methodologies used, quantification issues, reporting of QA/QC information, tissue sampling, nature of tissue analyzed, and laboratory competence. This article reviews and outlines these issues, discusses their implications for human health risk assessment, and recommends the consistent application of analytical fish tissue data in human health risk assessment.","Teck Cominco Ltd, Vancouver, BC V6C 319, Canada; Cantox Inc, Mississauga, ON, Canada; Toronto Publ Hlth, Environm Protect Off, Toronto, ON, Canada; Gartner Lee Ltd, Guelph, ON, Canada; Jrd Consulting Co, Heriot Bay, BC, Canada",,"Gilron, G (corresponding author), Teck Cominco Ltd, 600-200 Burrard St, Vancouver, BC V6C 319, Canada.",guy.gilron@teckcominco.com,,,,,,27,1,1,0,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Subsequent to the return of large carnivores to human-modified ecosystems, many prey species have adjusted their spatial behaviour to the contrasting landscapes of fear generated by both their natural predators and anthropogenic pressures. The effects of predation risk on temporal shifts in diel activity of prey, however, remain largely unexplored in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the influence of the density of lynx Lynx lynx, a nocturnal predator, on the diel activity patterns of their main prey, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus, across a gradient of human disturbance and hunting at the European scale. Based on 11 million activity records from 431 individually GPS-monitored roe deer in 12 populations within the EURODEER network (), we investigated how lynx predation risk in combination with both lethal and non-lethal human activities affected the diurnality of deer. We demonstrated marked plasticity in roe deer diel activity patterns in response to spatio-temporal variations in risk, mostly due to human activities. In particular, roe deer decreased their level of diurnality by a factor of 1.37 when the background level of general human disturbance was high. Hunting exacerbated this effect, as during the hunting season deer switched most of their activity to night-time and, to a lesser extent, to dawn, although this pattern varied noticeably in relation to lynx density. Indeed, in the presence of lynx, their main natural predator, roe deer were relatively more diurnal. Overall, our results revealed a strong influence of human activities and the presence of lynx on diel shifts in roe deer activity. In the context of the recovery of large carnivores across Europe, we provide important insights about the effects of predators on the behavioural responses of their prey in human-dominated ecosystems. Modifications in the temporal partitioning of ungulate activity as a response to human activities may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence, but likely also have knock-on effects for predator-prey interactions, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.","[Bonnot, Nadege; Kjellander, Petter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Bonnot, Nadege] Irstea, UR EFNO, Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; [Couriot, Ophelie; Morellet, Nicolas; Hewison, Aidan J.

Early versions of this hypothesis remain highly influential and have been incorporated into the National Institute of Mental Health Research Research Domain Criteria framework. However, new observations encourage a different perspective. Anatomical studies show that the Ce and BST form a tightly interconnected unit, where different kinds of threat-relevant information can be integrated and used to assemble states of fear and anxiety. Imaging studies in humans and monkeys show that the Ce and BST exhibit similar functional profiles. Both regions are sensitive to a range of aversive challenges, including uncertain or temporally remote threat; both covary with concurrent signs and symptoms of fear and anxiety; both show phasic responses to short-lived threat; and both show heightened activity during sustained exposure to diffusely threatening contexts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both regions can control the expression of fear and anxiety during sustained exposure to diffuse threat. These observations compel a reconsideration of the central extended amygdala's contributions to fear and anxiety and its role in neuropsychiatric disease.","[Shackman, Alexander J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Shackman, Alexander J.] Univ Maryland, Neurosci & Cognit Sci Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Shackman, Alexander J.] Univ Maryland, Maryland Neuroimaging Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Fox, Andrew S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Fox, Andrew S.] Univ Calif Davis, Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Shackman, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Fox, AS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",shackman@umd.edu; fox.drew@gmail.com,,,National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH107444]; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System; University of Maryland; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH107444] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R21DA040717] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health MH107444, University of California, and University of Maryland.

This study used event-related potential technology to investigate this in four categories of generalized stimulus (GS). We divided the GS into four categories: inferior typical members of conditioned stimulus (CS+) (TCS+), inferior atypical members of CS+ (ATCS+), inferior typical members of CS- (TCS-), and inferior atypical members of CS(-ATCS-). The CS+ groups elicited a larger P2 versus the CS- groups suggesting that aversive stimuli can automatically capture attention with timely avoidance of danger. Stimulus type (CS+; CS-) and typicality (typical; atypical) showed an interaction with N400. The elicited N400 was larger for atypical than typical members in CS- groups, but not in CS+ groups. Fear emotion elicited by CS+ may feature restrained semantic networks, dissipating typicality effects. Separate processing stages may modulate category-based fear generalization, with P2 representing first-stage low-level perceptual processing, and N400 second-stage high-level cognitive processing.","[Lei, Yi; Wang, Jinxia; Dou, Haoran; Qiu, Yiwen; Li, Hong] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol & Sociol, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yi; Wang, Jinxia; Dou, Haoran; Qiu, Yiwen; Li, Hong] Shenzhen Key Lab Affect & Social Cognit Sci, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yi; Wang, Jinxia; Dou, Haoran; Qiu, Yiwen; Li, Hong] Shenzhen Inst Neurosci, Ctr Language & Brain, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinxia; Dou, Haoran] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Educ & Psychol, Jyvaskyla, Finland",,"Lei, Y (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol & Sociol, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",leiyi821@vip.sina.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC31571153, 31871130]; (Key) Project of DEGP [2015KCXTD009];  [JCYJ20150729104249783]",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC31571153 and 31871130]; The (Key) Project of DEGP [2015KCXTD009]; JCYJ20150729104249783.,,75,8,8,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8760,1872-7697,,INT J PSYCHOPHYSIOL,Int.

One person (the aversive handler) carried out two daily sessions of an aversive treatment during 21 days, where each cow received two slaps on the rump and a strong yell. The control handler walked around the cows not menacing the cows. Flight distance from both handlers was measured before the treatments were imposed and 14 and 180 days later. Total and residual milk (measured after an i.v. oxytocin injection in the caudal vein) were measured when either the aversive or the neutral handler carried out the milking, between days 14 and 24 of the experiment. All the cows were used in both treatments in a cross-over design. Except for the day before treatments started, the cows kept a larger distance from the aversive than from the neutral handler, even after 180 days without contact with these handlers. Nevertheless, there was no effect of treatment on total milk yield or residual milk. The results corroborate others that show that cows can discriminate between aversive and neutral individuals. Under the conditions of the present study, the fact that milking was done by the aversive individual did not influence total milk yield and residual milk.","Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Zootecnia & Desenvolvimento Rural, Lab Etol Aplicada, BR-88034001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",,"Hotzel, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Zootecnia & Desenvolvimento Rural, Lab Etol Aplicada, Rodovia Admar Gonzaga,1346,Itacoruba, BR-88034001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",mjhotzel@cca.ufsc.br; pinheiro@cda-ufsc.br,"Htzel, Maria Jos/H-6975-2014; Filho, Luiz Carlos Pinheiro Machado/I-4330-2013","Htzel, Maria Jos/0000-0003-1034-3202; Filho, Luiz Carlos Pinheiro Machado/0000-0002-8182-8365",,,,28,11,12,4,21,REVISTA BRASILEIRA ZOOTECNIA BRAZILIAN JOURNAL ANIMAL SCI,VICOSA-MG,"UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL VICOSA,, 36571-000 VICOSA-MG, BRAZIL",1806-9290,,,REV BRAS ZOOTECN,Rev.

Although they inhibit the reuptake of serotonin within hours of administration, therapeutic improvement only occurs after several weeks. In this study, we used fear conditioning to begin to understand bow acute and chronic SSRI treatment might differentially affect well-characterized fear circuits. Methods. We evaluated the effects of acute and chronic treatment with the SSRI citalopram on the acquisition of auditory fear conditioning. To further understand the role of serotonin in modulating fear circuits, we compared these effects with those of acute and chronic administration of the antidepressant tianeptine, a purported serotonin reuptake enhancer. Results: We found that acute administration of the SSRI citalopram enhanced acquisition, whereas chronic treatment reduced the acquisition of auditory fear conditioning. In comparison, treatment with tianeptine had no effect acutely but also reduced the acquisition of tone conditioning when administered chronically. Conclusions: Our findings with citalopram are consistent with the clinical effects of SSRI treatment seen in patients with anxiety disorders, in which anxiety is often increased during early stages of treatment and decreased after several weeks of treatment. The findings also indicate that auditory fear conditioning can be a useful tool in understanding differences in the effects of short-term and long-term antidepressant treatment with serotonergic medications.","NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, WM Keck Fdn Lab Neurobiol, New York, NY 10003 USA; Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; Rockefeller Univ, Harold & Margaret Milliken Hatch Lab Neuroendocri, New York, NY 10021 USA; Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA",,"Burghardt, NS (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, WM Keck Fdn Lab Neurobiol, 4 Washington Pl,Room 809, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"McEwen, Bruce/Z-1630-2019",,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH058911] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH58911] Funding Source: Medline,,,65,178,185,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

The procedure was previously applied to a simple model; in this article a much more complex model is used, i.e., multiple compound and multiple exposure pathways. Risk was evaluated using the usual methodologies: the deterministic reasonable maximum exposure (RME) and the statistical Monte Carlo method. In both cases, the procedures to evaluate uncertainty on risk values are detailed. Uncertainties were evaluated by different methodologies to account for the peculiarity of information about the single variable. The GUM procedure enables the ranking of variables by their contribution to uncertainty; it provides a criterion for choosing variables for deeper analysis. The obtained results show that the application of GUM procedure is easy and straightforward to quantify uncertainty and variability of risk estimation. Health risk estimation is based on literature data on a water table contaminated by three volatile organic compounds. Daily intake was considered by either ingestion of water or inhalation during showering. The results indicate one of the substances as the main contaminant, and give a criterion to identify the key component on which the treatment selection may be performed and the treatment process may be designed in order to reduce risk.","[Sassi, Guido; Ruggeri, Bernardo] Politecn Turin, Dipartimento Ingn Chim, I-10129 Turin, Italy",,"Sassi, G (corresponding author), Politecn Turin, Dipartimento Ingn Chim, Cso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",guido.sassi@polito.it,,"Ruggeri, Bernardo/0000-0002-4440-5056; Sassi, Guido/0000-0002-6417-3467",,,,30,5,6,0,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-4332,,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,OCT,2008,28,5,,,,,1343,1356,,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01097.x,,,14,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",350OT,WOS:000259363300014,18684163,,,,2022-04-16,

As a result, it includes recommendations on overcrowding, frequency of cage changes, enrichment, and group housing. However, human odorants are a potential but unexplored source of fear, anxiety, and stress. Although mice have been maintained for decades for animal research, whether mice perceive humans as predators is unknown. If so, this would necessitate changes in animal care and use procedures to minimize this source of chronic fear, anxiety, and stress. Odorants from predator urine are well known to elicit strong fear responses in mice, leading to modification of animal behavior and elevated levels of stress. To begin asking whether human odors influence mouse behavior, we tested the effect of human urine odor on fear response in mice. We assessed mouse behavior by using a modified shuttle cage to record various parameters of mouse exposure to odorants. We found that mice displayed fear responses to 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, a synthetic analog of red fox feces, but no fear response to DMSO, the diluent for 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline. In contrast, mice exposed to human urine samples showed no significant fear response.","[Rivard, Germain F.; Moser, Emily G.; D'Ambrose, Steven P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Lin, David M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Ithaca, NY USA",,"Rivard, GF (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",germain.rivard@gmail.com,,,Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing,"We thank Harlan Laboratories for donating the mice used in these experiments.

Social learning of fear is expected to be especially advantageous for survival. However, disruption of social development in early life can impair social cognition and might also be expected to disrupt social learning. Social isolation during a critical period of adolescence disrupts social development. The purpose of this study was to determine whether disruption of social development through post-weaning social isolation leads to impairments of social fear learning. Rats were reared in isolation or pair-housed from immediately post-weaning, for 3 weeks. Social fear learning in rats was acquired by observation of tone-footshock pairings administered to a conspecific. Isolation-reared rats displayed less conditioned freezing than pair-housed rats when tested the next day. This reduction of conditioned freezing was correlated with conspecific-oriented behaviors during conditioning, was measured despite similarities in demonstrator behaviors, and occurred despite a manipulation that equalized freezing during conditioning between the pair-housed and isolation-reared rats. The results could not be explained by abnormal sensitization to a repeated tone or deficits in freezing or direct fear conditioning. These results demonstrate that observational fear conditioning is impaired by social isolation, and provide a model to study impaired social affective learning. Impaired social cognition, manifested as inability to recognize or appropriately interpret social cues, is a symptom of several psychiatric disorders. Better understanding of the mechanisms of impaired social fear learning can lead to novel treatments for social cognition symptoms of psychiatric disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To determine whether dorsal BNST (dBNST)-projecting neurons in the BA participate in contextual fear engrams, we combined the TetTag mouse with a retrograde tracer to label dBNST-projecting cells in the BA. We identified a population of neurons located in the anterior subdivision of the BA (aBA) that was activated during fear conditioning and reactivated during retrieval but that did not project to the dBNST. In contrast, dBNST-projecting neurons located in the posterior BA (pBA) were activated during contextual fear conditioning but were not reactivated during retrieval. Similarly, we found neurons in the oval BNST subdivision (ovBNST) that were activated during contextual fear conditioning without being reactivated during retrieval. However, the anterodorsal BNST (adBNST) subdivision was not activated during either contextual fear conditioning or retrieval, underscoring the divergent functionality of these two dBNST subdivisions. Finally, we found that the ovBNST receives a monosynaptic projection from neurons located in the BA. Our results indicate that aBA neurons that do not project to the dBNST participate in contextual fear engrams. In contrast, dBNST-projecting neurons in the BA do not appear to participate in contextual fear engrams, but might instead contain a BA -> ovBNST pathway that is active during the initial encoding of contextual fear memories.","[Russell, Jennifer Sasaki; Trouche, Stephanie; Reijmers, Leon G.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Russell, Jennifer Sasaki] Tufts Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Program Neurosci, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Trouche, Stephanie] Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CNRS, IGF, F-34094 Montpellier, France",,"Reijmers, LG (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",leon.reijmers@tufts.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 MH104589, DP2 OD006446, P30 NS047243]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 NS061764]; Dean's Graduate Fellowship; Fyssen Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship; Bettencourt Schueller Foundation Award; Philippe Foundation Award","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 MH104589 (to L.G.R.), DP2 OD006446 (to L.G.R.), and P30 NS047243 (Tufts Center for Neuroscience Research).

Its disruption has been associated with emotional dysregulation in stress and anxiety disorders. In this article we consider how age, genetics and experiences shape our capacity to regulate fear in cross-species studies. Evidence for adolescent-specific diminished fear extinction learning is presented in the context of immature frontolimbic circuitry. We also present evidence for less neural plasticity in fear regulation as a function of early-life stress and by genotype, focusing on the common brain derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism. Finally, we discuss this work in the context of exposure-based behavioral therapies for the treatment of anxiety and stress disorders that are based on principles of fear extinction. We conclude by speculating on how such therapies may be optimized for the individual based on the patient's age, genetic profile and personal history to move from standard treatment of care to personalized and precision medicine.

A common, effective treatment strategy involves repeated presentations to the feared cue without any danger (extinction). However, extinction learning has a number of important limitations, and enhancing its effects, generalizability and durability via cognitive enhancers may improve its therapeutic impact. In this review we focus specifically on the role of the cannabinoid system in fear extinction learning and its retention. We address the following questions: What are the neural circuits mediating fear extinction?; Can we make fear extinction more effective?; Can cannabinoids facilitate fear extinction in humans?; How might the cannabinoid system effect fear extinction? Collectively, translational evidence suggest that enhancing cannabinoid transmission may facilitate extinction learning and its recall, and that the cannabinoid system is a potential pharmacological target for improving the active learning that occurs during exposure-based behavioral treatments prompting future research in terms of mechanisms research, novel treatment approaches ('cognitive enhancers'), and pharmacotherapeutic drug discovery.","[Rabinak, Christine A.; Phan, K.

It has been debated whether such tests may involve human handling, since there may be considerable differences in horses' handling experience. ObjectivesTo investigate the effect of a short-term standardised handling procedure on reactions of young horses in 2 types of fear tests (including and excluding human handling). Study designAn experimental study with 3-year-old Icelandic horses (n = 24). MethodsHandled horses (n = 12) were trained according to a standardised handling procedure whereas controls (n = 12) remained untrained. Behavioural and heart rate responses in a novel object test and 2 handling fear tests (HFTs) were measured. The HFTs were conducted with both an unknown (HFT-unknown) and a known handler (HFT-known). ResultsThere was no effect of the handling procedure on the horses' behavioural and heart rate responses in the novel object test, nor in the HFT-unknown. In the HFT-known, however, handled horses showed a significantly shorter duration of reluctance behaviour compared with controls, whereas heart rates did not differ. Heart rates correlated significantly between tests. ConclusionsPrevious handling may affect the behavioural fear response of horses when handled by their usual handler, whereas this effect did not apply to an unknown handler. Heart rates appeared unaffected by handling and may be a more reliable indicator of fearfulness. Known handlers may mask' behavioural responses of horses in fear tests and thus handling by a known handler during testing may not be appropriate for objective evaluation of fearfulness in a practical situation.","[Marsboll, A.

It remains unclear if differences exist between these two threat-related emotions in conditioning and generalization. Evaluating different patterns of fear and disgust learning would facilitate a deeper understanding of how anxiety disorders develop. In this study, 32 college students completed threat conditioning tasks, including conditioned stimuli paired with frightening or disgusting images. Fear and disgust were divided into two randomly ordered blocks to examine differences by recording subjective US expectancy ratings and eye movements in the conditioning and generalization process. During conditioning, differing US expectancy ratings (fear vs. disgust) were found only on CS-, which may demonstrated that fear is associated with inferior discrimination learning. During the generalization test, participants exhibited greater US expectancy ratings to fear-related GS1 (generalized stimulus) and GS2 relative to disgust GS1 and GS2. Fear led to longer reaction times than disgust in both phases, and the pupil size and fixation duration for fear stimuli were larger than for disgust stimuli, suggesting that disgust generalization has a steeper gradient than fear generalization. These findings provide preliminary evidence for differences between fear- and disgust-related stimuli in conditioning and generalization, and suggest insights into treatment for anxiety and other fear- or disgust-related disorders.","[Wang, Jinxia; Dou, HaoRan; Lei, Yi] Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Brain & Psychol Sci, Chengdu 610066, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinxia; Dou, HaoRan] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Educ & Psychol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Sun, Xiaoying] Ningxia Coll Construct, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jiachen] South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yi] Shenzhen Inst Neurosci, Ctr Neurogenet, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China",,"Lei, Y (corresponding author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Brain & Psychol Sci, Chengdu 610066, Peoples R China.",leiyi821@vip.sina.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31871130]; Shenzhen-Hong Kong Institute of Brain Science-Shenzhen Fundamental Research Institutions [2019SHIBS0003, 2021SHIBS0003]; Guangdong Key Project in Development of new tools for diagnosis and treatment of Autism [2018B030335001]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant NO. 31871130]; Shenzhen-Hong Kong Institute of Brain Science-Shenzhen Fundamental Research Institutions (2019SHIBS0003; 2021SHIBS0003); Guangdong Key Project in Development of new tools for diagnosis and treatment of Autism (2018B030335001).,,52,0,0,4,4,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUL 9,2021,11,1,,,,,,,14210,10.1038/s41598-021-93544-7,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,TK9QA,WOS:000674488400012,34244571,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-16,

During fear expression, the LA is thought to engage the central nucleus of the amygdala (CE), which serves as the principal output nucleus for the expression of conditioned fear responses. In the present study, we reexamined the roles of LA and CE. Specifically, we asked whether CE, like LA, might also be involved in fear learning and memory consolidation. Using functional inactivation methods, we first show that CE is involved not only in the expression but also the acquisition of fear conditioning. Next, we show that inhibition of protein synthesis in CE after training impairs fear memory consolidation. These findings indicate that CE is not only involved in fear expression but, like LA, is also involved in the learning and consolidation of pavlovian fear conditioning.","NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, WM Keck Fdn Lab Neurobiol, New York, NY 10003 USA; Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Interdepartmental Neorosci Program, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,"LeDoux, JE (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, WM Keck Fdn Lab Neurobiol, Room 809,4 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",ledoux@cns.nyu.edu,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH46516, R01 MH046516, F31 MH063612, F31 MH63612, R37 MH038774, R37 MH38774, K05 MH067048] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH046516, R37MH038774, K05MH067048, F31MH063612] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,66,375,384,0,31,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,1529-2401,,J NEUROSCI,J.

These traditional paradigms measure a limited selection of variables over a short duration, providing only a snapshot of fear and anxiety-related behavior. Overreliance on these paradigms and such behavioral snapshots ultimately lead to a narrow understanding of these complex motivational states. Here, we elaborate on the closed economy; a seldom-used paradigm that has been modified to comprehensively study fear and anxiety-related behavior and neurocircuitry in rodents. In this modified Risky Closed Economy (RCE) paradigm, animals live nearly uninterrupted in behavioral chambers where the need to acquire food and water and avoid threat is integrated into the task. Briefly, animals are free to acquire all of their food and water in a designated foraging zone. An unsignaled, unpredictable threat (footshock) is introduced into the foraging zone after a baseline activity and consumption period to model the risk of predation, which is then removed for a final extinction assessment. This longitudinal design, wherein data from a multitude of variables are collected automatically and continuously for 23 h/day over several weeks to months, affords a more holistic understanding of the effects of fear and anxiety on day-to-day behavior. Also, we discuss its general benefits relevant to other topics in neuroscience research, its limitations, and present data demonstrating for the first time The Risky Closed Economy's viability in mice.","[Schuessler, Bryan P.; Zambetti, Peter R.; Kukuoka, Kisho M.; Kim, Eun Joo; Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Program Neurosci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Program Neurosci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH099073, AG067008]","This work was funded by National Institutes of Health grant MH099073 [JK, principal investigator (PI)] and AG067008 (EK, PI).",,51,4,4,1,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

A deterrent that capitalizes on learning mechanisms, like fear conditioning, may enhance success while simultaneously balancing welfare concerns and reduce noise pollution. During fear conditioning, individuals learn the cues that precede the dangerous stimuli, and respond by avoiding the painful situations. We tested the efficacy of fear conditioning using acoustic stimuli for reducing California sea lion Zalophus californianus interactions from two fishing contexts in California, USA; bait barges and recreational fishing vessels. We performed conditioning trials on 24 individual sea lions interacting with bait barges. We tested for acquisition of conditioned fear by pairing a neutral tone with a startle stimulus. Avoidance was strongest in response to the startle stimulus alone, but low when paired with a neutral tone. From actively fishing vessels, we tested for fear conditioning by exposing sea lions to a neutral tone followed by a startle pulse, a startle pulse alone or a no sound control. We conducted playbacks from 146 (including 48 no sound control) stops over two summer fishing seasons (2013, 2014). The startle stimulus decreased surfacing frequency, reduced bait foraging and increased surfacing distance from the vessel while the conditioned stimulus only caused a mild reduction in surfacing frequency with no other behavioral change. Exposing animals to a pair of a conditioned stimulus with a startle pulse did not achieve the intended management outcome. Rather, it generated evidence (in two study contexts) of immediate learning that led to the reduction of the unconditioned response. Taken together, our results suggest that for fear conditioning to be applied as a non-lethal deterrent, careful consideration has to be given to individual behavior, the unconditioned/conditioned responses and the overall management goals.","[Schakner, Zachary A.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gotz, Thomas; Janik, Vincent M.] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",,"Schakner, ZA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",zschakner@ucla.edu,,"Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244; Gotz, Thomas/0000-0002-4630-3328; Janik, Vincent/0000-0001-7894-0121; schakner, zachary/0000-0002-8325-3526",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); LaKretz Center for California Conservation Science; Sportfishing Association of California; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1557130] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [smru10001] Funding Source: researchfish,"Z.S. was supported by a NSF predoctoral fellowship and by a grant from the LaKretz Center for California Conservation Science.

Understanding neural circuits and how circuit structure gives rise to neural firing patterns or computations is fundamental to our understanding of human experience and behavior. Fear conditioning is a powerful model system in which to study neural circuits and information processing and relate them to learning and behavior. Until recently, technological limitations have made it difficult to study the causal role of specific circuit elements during fear conditioning. However, newly developed optogenetic tools allow researchers to manipulate individual circuit components such as anatomically or molecularly defined cell populations, with high temporal precision. Applying these tools to the study of fear conditioning to control specific neural subpopulations in the fear circuit will facilitate a causal analysis of the role of these circuit elements in fear learning and memory. By combining this approach with in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake, behaving animals, it will also be possible to determine the functional contribution of specific cell populations to neural processing in the fear circuit. As a result, the application of optogenetics to fear conditioning could shed light on how specific circuit elements contribute to neural coding and to fear learning and memory. Furthermore, this approach may reveal general rules for how circuit structure and neural coding within circuits gives rise to sensory experience and behavior.","[Johansen, Joshua P.] RIKEN Brain Sci Inst, Lab Neural Circuitry Memory, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Johansen, Joshua P.; LeDoux, Joseph E.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Wolff, Steffen B.

These data indicate that the reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory includes changes in ensemble activities between the lateral amygdala and CAI.","Univ Munster, Inst Physiol 1, D-48149 Munster, Germany; Otto Von Guericke Univ, Inst Physiol, Magdeburg, Germany",,"Pape, HC (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Physiol 1, Robert Koch Str 27a, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",papechris@ukmuenster.de,,"Stork, Oliver/0000-0003-4285-7507; Sangha, Susan/0000-0002-6461-4146",,,,24,44,44,1,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0959-4965,1473-558X,,NEUROREPORT,Neuroreport,JUL 16,2007,18,11,,,,,1107,1111,,10.1097/WNR.0b013e3282004992,,,5,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,188LC,WOS:000247920400004,17589308,,,,2022-04-16,

Epidemiological studies conducted at locations impacted by non-human faecal sources have provided ambiguous and inconsistent estimates of risk. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) is another tool to evaluate potential human health risks from recreational exposures to non-human faecal contamination. The potential risk differential between human and selected non-human faecal sources has been characterized previously for direct deposition of animal feces to water. In this evaluation, we examine the human illness potential from a recreational exposure to freshwater impacted by rainfall-induced runoff containing agricultural animal faecal material. Risks associated with these sources would be at least an order of magnitude lower than the benchmark level of public health protection associated with current US recreational water quality criteria, which are based on contamination from human sewage sources.

We used magnetic neuroimaging and molecular genetic analyses with healthy subjects and patients possessing X-chromosome anomalies to find dosage-sensitive genes that might influence amygdala development. If such X-linked genes lacked a homologue on the Y-chromosome they would be expressed in one copy in normal 46,XY males and two copies in normal 46,XX females. We showed by means of magnetic neuroimaging that 46,XY males possess significantly increased amygdala volumes relative to normal 46,XX females. However, females with Turner syndrome (45,X) have even larger amygdalae than 46,XY males. This finding implies that haploinsufficiency for one or more X-linked genes influences amygdala development irrespective of a direct or indirect (endocrinological) mechanism involving the Y-chromosome. 45,X females also have increased grey matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, close to a region implicated in emotional learning. They are as poor as patients with bilateral amygdalectomies in the recognition of fear from facial expressions. We attempted to localize the gene(s) responsible for these deficits in X-monosomy by means of a deletion mapping strategy. We studied female patients possessing structural X-anomalies of the short arm. A genetic locus (no greater than 4.96 Mb in size) at Xp11.3 appears to play a key role in amygdala and orbitofrontal structural and (by implication) functional development. Females with partial X-chromosome deletions, in whom this critical locus is deleted, have normal intelligence. Their fear recognition is as poor as that of 45,X females and their amygdalae are correspondingly enlarged. This 4.96 Mb region contains, among others, the genes for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and B (MAOB), which are involved in the oxidative deamination of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin. Abnormal activity of these neurotransmitters has been implicated in the aetiology of several neurodevelopmental disorders in which social cognitive deficits are prominent. These associated deficits include a specific lack of fear recognition from facial expressions. We show that the thrombocytic activity of MAOB is proportionate to the number of X-chromosomes, and hypothesize that haploinsufficiency of this enzyme in 45,X females predisposes to their deficits in social cognition.","Inst Child Hlth, Behav & Brain Sci Unit, London WC1N 1EH, England; Inst Neurol, Wellcome Dept Imaging Neurosci, London WC1N 3BG, England; Salisbury Dist Hosp, Wessex Reg Genet Lab, Salisbury, Wilts, England; BMC, Pharmacol Sect, Dept Neurosci, Uppsala, Sweden; Inst Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy",,"Skuse, DH (corresponding author), Inst Child Hlth, Behav & Brain Sci Unit, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England.",dskuse@ich.ucl.ac.uk,"Frackowiak, Richard S/I-1809-2013; Ashburner, John/I-3757-2013; Friston, Karl/D-9230-2011; Frackowiak, Richard/H-4383-2011","Ashburner, John/0000-0001-7605-2518; Friston, Karl/0000-0001-7984-8909; Frackowiak, Richard/0000-0002-3151-822X; Price, Catherine/0000-0001-7448-4835; Lawrence, Kate/0000-0002-0284-9804",Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [051067] Funding Source: Medline,,,81,136,141,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-8950,1460-2156,,BRAIN,Brain,NOV,2003,126,,11,,,,2431,2446,,10.1093/brain/awg242,,,16,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,735ZL,WOS:000186144800009,12958079,,,,2022-04-16,

However, the neural mechanism of automatic memory consolidation of fear conditioning is still unclear. To address this question, we measured brain activity following fear acquisition using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). In the current study, we used a marker of fMRI, amplitude of low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) fluctuation (ALFF) to quantify the spontaneous brain activity. Brain activity correlated to fear memory consolidation was observed in parahippocampus, insula, and thalamus in resting-state. Furthermore, after acquired fear conditioning, compared with control group some brain areas showed ALFF increased in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the experimental group, whereas some brain areas showed decreased ALFF in striatal regions (caudate, putamen). Moreover, the change of ALFF in vmPFC was positively correlated with the subjective fear ratings. These findings suggest that the parahippocampus, insula, and thalamus are the neural substrates of fear memory consolidation. The difference in activity could be attributed to a homeostatic process in which the vmPFC and ACC were involved in the fear recovery process, and change of ALFF in vmPFC predicts subjective fear ratings.

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a retrograde inhibitory signaling pathway involved in regulating central responses to stress. The eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) has recently been proposed to serve as a homeostatic signal mitigating adverse effects of stress exposure, however, less well understood is 2 AG's role in fear learning and fear extinction. In this study, we have sought to explore 2-AG's role in fear conditioning and fear extinction by disrupting 2-AG synthesis utilizing the DAGL inhibitor (DO34) and DAGL alpha knock-out mice (DAGL alpha(-/-)). We found that DAGL alpha(-/-) mice, and male and female C57B6/J mice treated with DO34, exhibited impairment in extinction learning in an auditory cue fear-conditioning paradigm. DO34 did not increase unconditioned freezing. Interestingly, inhibition of fatty-acid amide hydrolase was not able to restore normal fear extinction in DO34-treated mice suggesting increased Anandamide cannot compensate for deficient 2-AG signaling in the regulation of fear extinction. Moreover, augmentation of CB1R signaling with tetrahydrocannabinol also failed to restore normal fear extinction in DO34-treated mice. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that DAGL alpha plays an important role in fear extinction learning. Although genetic and pharmacological disruption of DAGL activity causes widespread lipidomic remodeling, these data combined with previous studies putatively suggest that deficient 2-AG signaling could be a susceptibility endophenotype for the development of trauma-related psychiatric disorders.","[Cavener, Victoria S.; Gaulden, Andrew; Pennipede, Dante; Jagasia, Puja; Patel, Sachin] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Cavener, Victoria S.; Patel, Sachin] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Uddin, Jashim; Marnett, Lawrence J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, AB Hancock Jr Mem Lab Canc Res, Vanderbilt Inst Chem Biol,Dept Biochem, Nashville, TN USA; [Uddin, Jashim; Marnett, Lawrence J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, AB Hancock Jr Mem Lab Canc Res, Vanderbilt Inst Chem Biol,Dept Chem, Nashville, TN USA; [Uddin, Jashim; Marnett, Lawrence J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, AB Hancock Jr Mem Lab Canc Res, Vanderbilt Inst Chem Biol,Dept Pharmacol, Nashville, TN USA",,"Patel, S (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.; Patel, S (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Brain Inst, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",sachin.patel@vanderbilt.edu,"Patel, Sachin/E-5608-2012","Cavener, Victoria/0000-0002-3320-8639",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH107435]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [U54HD083211] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH107435] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,These studies were supported by NIH Grant MH107435 (SP).

However, snake species differ in their true level of danger and are highly variable in appearance despite the uniform legless form. Different snakes may evoke fear or disgust in humans, or even both emotions simultaneously. We designed three-step-selection experiments to identify prototypical snake species evoking exclusively fear or disgust. First, two independent groups of respondents evaluated 45 images covering most of the natural variability of snakes and rated responses to either perceived fear (n = 175) or disgust (n = 167). Snakes rated as the most fear-evoking were from the family Viperidae (Crotalinae, Viperinae, and Azemiopinae), while the ones rated as the most disgusting were from the group of blind snakes called Typhlopoidea (Xenotyphlopinae, Typhlopinae, and Anomalepidinae). We then identified the specific traits contributing to the perception of fear (large body size, expressive scales with contrasting patterns, and bright coloration) and disgust (thin body, smooth texture, small eyes, and dull coloration). Second, to create stimuli evoking a discrete emotional response, we developed a picture set consisting of 40 snakes with exclusively fear-eliciting and 40 snakes with disgust-eliciting features. Another set of respondents (n = 172) sorted the set, once according to perceived fear and the second time according to perceived disgust. The results showed that the fear-evoking and disgust-evoking snakes fit mainly into their respective groups. Third, we randomly selected 20 species (10 fear-evoking and 10 disgust-evoking) out of the previous set and had them professionally illustrated. A new set of subjects (n = 104) sorted these snakes and confirmed that the illustrated snakes evoked the same discrete emotions as their photographic counterparts. These illustrations are included in the study and may be freely used as a standardized assessment tool when investigating the role of fear and disgust in human emotional response to snakes.","[Radlova, S.; Janovcova, M.; Sedlackova, K.; Polak, J.; Nacar, D.; Peleskova, S.; Frynta, D.; Landova, E.] Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Klecany, Czech Republic; [Janovcova, M.; Sedlackova, K.; Frynta, D.; Landova, E.] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Polak, J.] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Psychol, Fac Arts, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Frynta, D (corresponding author), Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Klecany, Czech Republic.; Frynta, D (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",frynta@centrum.cz,"Rdlov, Silvie/D-5532-2017; Frynta, Daniel/L-7350-2016; Polk, Jakub/M-9927-2017","Rdlov, Silvie/0000-0003-3581-9780; Frynta, Daniel/0000-0002-1375-7972; Polk, Jakub/0000-0001-5005-3328","MEYS under the NPU I program [17-15991S, LO1611]","This study was funded by the GA.

To date, however,the role of the rACC specifically during the acquisition of auditory fear conditioning still remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate a possible top-down control of a specific rACC sub-region over amygdala activation during pavlovian fear acquisition. Methods: We performed excitotoxic lesions, temporal inactivation, and activation of a specific sub-region of the rACC that we identified by tracing studies as supporting most of the connectivity with the basolateral amygdala (r(Amy)-ACC). The effects of these manipulations over amygdala function were investigated with a classical tone-shock associative fear conditioning paradigm in the rat. Results: Excitotoxic lesions and transient inactivation of the r(Amy)-ACC pre-training selectively produced deficits in the acquisition of the tone-shock associative learning (but not context). This effect was specific for the acquisition phase. However, the deficit was found to be transient and could be overcome by overtraining. Conversely, pre-training transient activation of the r(Amy)-ACC facilitated associative learning and increased fear expression. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a subregion of the rACC is key to gating the efficiency of amygdala-dependent auditory fear conditioning learning. Because r(Amy)-ACC inputs were confirmed to be glutamatergic, we propose that recruitment of this brain area might modulate overall basolateral amygdala excitatory tone during conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus concomitant processing. In the light of clinical research, our results provide new insight on the effect of inappropriate rACC recruitment during emotional events.","[Cryan, John F.] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Sch Pharm, Cork, Ireland; [Bissiere, Stephanie; Hoyer, Daniel; McAllister, Kevin H.; Olpe, Hans-Rudolf; Cryan, John F.] Novartis Pharma AG, Novartis Inst BioMed Res, Basel, Switzerland; [Plachta, Nicolas] Univ Basel, Biozentrum, Dept Neurobiol, Basel, Switzerland; [Grace, Anthony A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci Psychiat & Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Cryan, JF (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Sch Pharm, Cavanagh Pharm Bldg, Cork, Ireland.",j.cryan@ucc.ie,"Cryan, John F./A-6950-2013; hoyer, daniel/L-3647-2019","Cryan, John F./0000-0001-5887-2723; hoyer, daniel/0000-0002-1405-7089; Grace, Anthony/0000-0003-1864-5504","NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01 DA015408-07, R01 DA015408] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA015408] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,70,96,98,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

A U.S. National survey tests hypotheses on the impact of fear induced by media messages and describes how evolutionary functionality operates to produce responses of following and/or avoiding the topics. Results show fear is important, but so is the perceived significance of the threat, perceived personal efficacy to cope with the threat, perceived news overload, and news consumption habits. Following news is mainly a function of high news use habits and the perceived importance of topics. Finally, following and avoiding news are not on a single dimension, as the two behaviors are most often uncorrelated.","[Tunney, Carin] Michigan State Univ, Dept Informat & Media Studies, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Thorson, Esther] Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chen, Weiyue] Butler Univ, Eugene S Pulliam Sch Journalism & Creat Media, Indianapolis, IN 46208 USA",,"Tunney, C (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Informat & Media Studies, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",tunneyca@msu.edu,,"Tunney, Carin/0000-0002-0883-8604",,,,82,4,4,12,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

The developed IDM health risk assessment (IDMHRA) approach is applied to assess previous, current, and future risks at a case study site in Daqing, Heilongjiang, China, from 1985 to 2020 for model validation. The human health risk assessment results show that 11 PAHs (NAP, ANT, FLA, PYR, BaA, CHR, BbF, BkF, BaP, IPY, and DBA) in the study site require further remediation efforts in terms of their unacceptable non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk. The results of risk source analysis reveal that soil media is the main risk pathway as compared with other exposure pathways. It can be seen that remediation process for soil contamination in the study site is urgently demanded. The assessment results demonstrate that the developed IDMHRA approach provides an effective tool for decision-makers and environmental managers to make remediation decisions in contaminated sites.","[Zhang, Yang; Shen, Jing; Wen, Jingya; Hu, Yan; Li, Yu] North China Elect Power Univ, Resources & Environm Res Acad, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [He, Li] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Renewable Energy, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Li, Y (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Resources & Environm Res Acad, 2 Beinong Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",liyuxx8@hotmail.com,,,Key Projects in the National Science and Technology Pillar Program in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period [2008BAC43B01],This study was supported by Key Projects in the National Science and Technology Pillar Program in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period (2008BAC43B01).,,62,1,1,6,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

These findings link amygdala synaptic plasticity to the coding of fear memories. Behavioural experiments suggest that the amygdala serves to store long-term fear memories. Here we provide electrophysiological evidence showing that synaptic alterations in rats induced by fear conditioning are evident in vitro 10 days after fear conditioning. We show that synaptic transmission was facilitated and that high-frequency stimulation dependent LTP (HFS-LTP) of the cortico-lateral amygdala pathway remained attenuated 10 days following fear conditioning. Additionally, we found that the low-frequency stimulation dependent LTP (LFS-LTP) measured 24 h after fear conditioning was absent 10 days post-training. The persistent facilitation of synaptic transmission and occlusion of HFS-LTP suggests that, unlike hippocampal coding of contextual fear memory, the cortico-lateral amygdala synapse is involved in the storage of long-term fear memories. However, the absence of LFS-LTP 10 days following fear conditioning suggests that amygdala physiology 1 day following fear learning may reflect a dynamic state during memory stabilization that is inactive during the long-term storage of fear memory. Results from these experiments have significant implications regarding the locus of storage for maladaptive fear memories and the synaptic alterations induced by these memories.","Univ Texas, Med Branch, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Grad Program Neurosci, Galveston, TX 77555 USA",,"Shinnick-Gallagher, P (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Med Branch, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Grad Program Neurosci, 301 Univ Blvd, Galveston, TX 77555 USA.",psgallag@utmb.edu,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH58327, F 30 MH067458] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH058327, F30MH067458] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,49,59,62,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0953-816X,1460-9568,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

Environmentally related diseases are preventable, yet they impose a major burden on society in terms of human suffering and costs related to health care. Similarly, the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars for regulatory compliance is a major economic concern. There is considerable debate regarding current regulatory risk assessment practices for environmental agents. Implicit in all risk assessment schemes is the need to extrapolate from high-exposure studies to low-exposure situations and from known risks in rodents to probable risks in people. Both extrapolations are fraught with uncertainties. These uncertainties are accommodated in risk-assessment schemes by the incorporation of arbitrary ''safety factors'' and other default approaches. Since these factors are not derived experimentally, they may overestimate or under estimate actual risks. Risk-assessment methodology, its relevance to the human condition, and its use in protecting human health will greatly improve when our expanding knowledge of the basic biology of environmental effects is incorporated into toxicological testing and risk-assessment schemes. Moreover, exciting opportunities now exist to advance our understanding of the environmental and genetic bases of many common diseases and to design effective prevention and intervention strategies to combat their development. This report discusses some of the current opportunities and challenges.

Given the efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) in treating PTSD, pursuit eye movements are a promising and novel intervention for studies of human memory reconsolidation. Here, we examined the efficacy of pursuit eye movements in interfering with reconsolidation of conditioned fear memories. Methods: We conducted a 3-day differential Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure in healthy adults, using videos of biologically prepared stimuli (tarantulas), partly reinforced with electrical shocks while recording skin conductance response (SCR) as a measure of autonomic conditioned responses. Fear conditioning was performed on Day 1. On Day 2, 38 participants were randomized into groups performing pursuit eye movements either immediately after fear memory reactivation, when the fear memory was stable, or 10 min later, when the fear memory was assumed to be more labile. On Day 3, fear memory strength was assessed by SCR to both reactivated and nonreactivated fear memories. Results: Strong differential conditioning to the spider stimuli were observed during both fear acquisition and fear memory reactivation. Reactivated fear memory conditioned responses of participants performing pursuit eye movements after a 10-min delay were significantly smaller in the reinstatement phase (0.16 mu S; 95% CI [0.02, 0.31]). Conclusions: Pursuit eye movements were effective in reducing fear-conditioned SCR in reinstatement. This result supports the theoretical proposition that EMDR can interfere with reactivated fear memory reconsolidation.","[Jellestad, Lena; Zeffiro, Thomas; Malamud, Jolanda; Klimke, Benedikt B.

When a discrete auditory-conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with footshock (unconditioned stimulus, US) within the largely olfactory context, infants and adolescents conditioned to the context with substantial effectiveness, but adult rats did not. When unpaired presentations of the CS and US occurred within the context, contextual fear conditioning was strong for adults, weak for infants, but about as strong for adolescents as when pairings of CS and US occurred in the context. Nonreinforced presentations of either the CS or context markedly reduced contextual fear conditioning in infants, but, in adolescents, CS extinction had no effect on contextual fear conditioning, although context extinction significantly reduced it. Neither CS extinction nor context extinction affected responding to the CS-context compound in infants, suggesting striking discrimination between the compound and its components. Female adolescents showed the same lack of effect of component extinction on response to the compound as infants, but CS extinction reduced responding to the compound in adolescent males, a sex difference seen also in adults.

When discrete predictors for pain are lacking, fear typically accrues to the broader environmental context: a phenomenon referred to as contextual pain-related fear. We examined whether conceptual similarity between discrete contexts facilitates pain-related fear generalization; this mechanism is known as category-level fear generalization. Using a voluntary joystick movement paradigm, pain-free participants performed movements in 2 contexts (within-subjects design); context was manipulated by varying background color screens. In the predictable context, one movement predicted pain and another did not. In the unpredictable context, 2 other movements never predicted pain but pain was unpredictably delivered during the context. Participants subsequently learned to categorize novel background colors (ie, generalization contexts) as being similar to either the unpredictable or predictable pain context. Then we tested fear generalization to these novel contexts. We measured self-reported pain related fear, expectancy, and eyeblink startle. Results indicated higher pain-related fear reports, but no elevated startle responses, for generalization contexts that were trained to be similar to the original unpredictable context rather than the predictable pain context. This highlights a potential pathway through which neutral contexts can elicit pain-related fear and motivate avoidance behavior associated with chronic pain disability. Perspective: Self-reported pain-related fear and expectancy of painful outcome in response to a context associated with unpredictable pain generalizes to perceptually distinct contexts that are trained to be conceptually similar to the unpredictable pain context. Category-level generalization may be a pathway contributing to spreading of fear and avoidance in chronic pain.
