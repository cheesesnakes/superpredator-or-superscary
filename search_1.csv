Fear of humans has been proposed to act as a substitute, but new research identifies humans as a super predator globally far more lethal to mesocarnivores, and thus presumably far more frightening. Although much of the world now consists of human-dominated landscapes, there remains relatively little research regarding how behavioral responses to humans affect trophic networks, to the extent that no study has yet experimentally tested the relative fearfulness mesocarnivores demonstrate in reaction to humans versus nonhuman predators. Badgers (Meles meles) in Britain are a model mesocarnivore insofar as they no longer need fear native large carnivores (bears, Ursus arctos; wolves, Canis lupus) and now perhaps fear humans more. We tested the fearfulness badgers demonstrated to audio playbacks of extant (dog) and extinct (bear and wolf) large carnivores, and humans, by assaying the suppression of foraging behavior. Hearing humans affected latency to feed, vigilance, foraging time, number of feeding visits, and number of badgers feeding. Hearing dogs and bears had far lesser effects on latency to feed, and hearing wolves had no effects. Our results indicate fear of humans evidently cannot substitute for the fear large carnivores inspire in mesocarnivores because humans are perceived as far more frightening, which we discuss in light of the recovery of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV-DEC,2016,27,6,,,,,1826,1832,,10.1093/beheco/arw117,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Deer were more than twice as likely to flee upon hearing humans than other predators, and hearing humans was matched only by hearing wolves in reducing overall feeding time gaged by visits to the food patch in the following hour. Combined with previous, site-specific research linking deer fecundity to predator abundance, this study reveals that fear of humans has the potential to induce a larger effect on ungulate reproduction than has ever been reported.

Where both disturbance types co-occur, disentangling their impacts remains a challenge. Disturbance effects may interact such that species respond to increased human footprint by either reducing (habituation) or increasing (sensitization) avoidance of human presence. We experimentally manipulated perceived human presence, using playbacks of people talking, across a gradient of human footprint in California's Santa Cruz Mountains and used camera traps to quantify the behavioral responses of bobcats (Lynx rufus), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), mesopredators known to exhibit strong fear response to human presence, but which vary in their use of developed areas. Bobcats and skunks reduced activity in response to human playbacks but showed no change in responsiveness to playbacks across the gradient of human footprint, suggesting that these species are similarly fearful of humans at all infrastructure development levels tested. Opossums exhibited a significant interaction between human footprint and playback treatment such that reductions in activity level in response to human playbacks were strongest at higher levels of building density. Our results indicate that, rather than habituating to human presence some mesopredators retain a strong fear of humans or become more fearful when inhabiting more developed areas. We suggest that consistently high responsiveness to immediate human presence may benefit mesopredators living in human-dominated landscapes by mitigating the risk of anthropogenic mortality. Mesopredators remain fearful of humans, whether they are in remote, protected areas, or in the backyards of densely populated suburbs. Using an experimental approach, we show that bobcats and striped skunks exhibit a consistent fear response to people, regardless of level of human footprint. Meanwhile, Virginia opossums exhibit heightened fear in areas of high human disturbance. Maintaining a strong fear response to humans may help mesopredators coexist in human-dominated landscapes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/beheco/arab150,,JAN 2022,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves.

We conducted a landscape-scale playback experiment demonstrating that the sound of humans speaking generates a landscape of fear with pervasive effects across wildlife communities. Large carnivores avoided human voices and moved more cautiously when hearing humans, while medium-sized carnivores became more elusive and reduced foraging. Small mammals evidently benefited, increasing habitat use and foraging. Thus, just the sound of a predator can have landscape-scale effects at multiple trophic levels.

While many studies have used flight initiation distance as a proxy for fearfulness and examined the factors influencing the decision to flee, there is no general understanding of the relative importance of these factors. By identifying factors with large effect sizes, we can determine whether anti-predator strategies reduce fear, and we gain a unique perspective on the coevolution of predator and anti-predator behaviour. Based on an extensive review and formal meta-analysis, we found that predator traits that were associated with greater risk (speed, size, directness of approach), increased prey distance to refuge and experience with predators consistently amplified the perception of risk (in terms of flight initiation distance). While fish tolerated closer approach when in larger schools, other taxa had greater flight initiation distances when in larger groups. The presence of armoured and cryptic morphologies decreased perception of risk, but body temperature in lizards had no robust effect on flight initiation distance.

We studied how red deer perceive the landscape of fear in an old-growth forest system (Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland) both at large and fine spatial scale. Camera traps were placed at locations with and without tree logs (fine-scale risk factor) and at different distances from the core of a wolf territory and human settlements (large-scale risk factor). Red deer avoided coming close to large tree logs and increased their vigilance levels when they were present in close vicinity. The strength of these effects depended on the distance to the wolf core area; deer perceived tree logs as more risky when wolves were more often present. Hence, tree logs inside wolf core areas create fine-scale patches of fear with reduced deer browsing pressure, thereby enhancing chances for successful tree recruitment. Human presence shapes this landscape of fear as wolf core areas are located far from human settlements.

As widespread apex predators, humans present a significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain lions Puma concolor to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Mendocino County, California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct, contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for prey.

In Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) depend on a nearly continuous intake of berries, especially bilberries (Vaccinium myrtilius) during late summer and early autumn to fatten up prior to hibernation. This overlaps with the bear hunting season that starts on 21 August. Bilberry occurrence varies across space, as does human-induced mortality risk. Here, we hypothesize that brown bears select for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence across a boreal forest ecosystem in Sweden (H1), and that human-induced mortality risk reduces bear selection for bilberries (H2). In addition, we hypothesized that hears that survived the hunting season avoided bilberry areas associated with high risk, whereas bears that were later killed selected more strongly for berries and less against risk prior to the hunting season (H3). To evaluate our hypotheses, we used resource selection functions to contrast bear GPS relocation data (N = 3 5, 2012-2015) and random positions within the bears home range with generalized linear mixed effect models against two focal variables: a map predicting bilberry occurrence and a map predicting human-induced mortality risk. We found that bears selected for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence (supporting H1), but avoided these areas if they were associated with and high risk of hunting mortality (supporting H2). The killed and surviving bears did not differ in their selection for bilberries, hut they did differ in their selection against risk (partially supporting H3). Surviving bears strongly avoided high risk areas, whereas killed hears responded less to risk and selected for high-risk areas with a low probability of bilberry occurrence. This suggests that killed bears selected for other food sources than berries in high risk areas, which exposed them to human hunters. We conclude that bears respond to a landscape of fear during the berry season and that different foraging strategies may have a direct impact on individual mortality during the hunting season.

Large predators and mesopredators usually produce this fear in animals. This effect is recognised in the form of various behavioural changes and adaptations, which, in turn, affects the whole ecosystem. However, we often overlook the role of large predators and mesopredators in the sustenance of our ecosystem by such non-lethal effects, because fear is often seen as a psychological effect rather than something that can be found through explicit scientific means. Indeed, the fear that predators trigger inside their prey may play a significant role in the maintenance of the natural environment. This paper aims to analyse this hypothesis by reviewing the function of the ecology of fear based on the interaction among predators, prey, and mesopredators. We consider the factors involved in the effective functionality of the ecology of fear, including habitat landscape, season, weather, and predation risk. We also assess the extent of influence of large predators on behaviour and distribution of prey and mesopredators in terms of predation cues and prey grouping as responses to predation risk.

We tested the magnitude of the human shield effect experimentally on 2 groups of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarcus, at a site with high natural predator density and no human hunting pressure. In general, giving-up densities-the density of food remaining in a patch when a forager leaves-were greatest at ground level (0.1 m) relative to 3 tree canopy levels (2.5, 5, and 7.5 m), highlighting a strong vertical axis of fear. When human followers were present, however, giving-up densities were reduced at all 4 heights; furthermore, for 1 group, the vertical axis disappeared in the presence of observers.

Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 % more nocturnal and three species become 11.7% more diurnal in high disturbed areas.

Yet, seldom are parents observed across multiple reproductive bouts, with few studies considering anthropogenic disturbances as an ecological driver of maternal effects. We observed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs over two successive litters to determine whether among-litter differences in behavior (i.e., risk-taking) and hormones (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) corresponded with parental plasticity in habituation. Thus, we explicitly test the hypothesis that accumulating experiences of anthropogenic disturbance reduces parental fear across reproductive bouts, which should have disparate phenotypic consequences for first- and second-litter offspring. To quantify risk-taking behavior, we used foraging assays from 5-15 weeks of age with a human observer present as a proxy for human disturbance. At 5, 10, and 15 weeks of age, we collected shaved hair to quantify pup hormone levels. We then used a quantitative genetic approach to estimate heritability, repeatability, and between-trait correlations. We found that parents were riskier (i.e., foraged more frequently) with their second versus first litters, supporting our prediction that parents become increasingly habituated over time. Second-litter pups were also less risk-averse than their first-litter siblings. Heritability for all traits did not differ from zero (0.001-0.018); however, we found moderate support for repeatability in all observed traits (r = 0.085-0.421). Lastly, we found evidence of positive phenotypic and cohort correlations among pup traits, implying that cohort identity (i.e., common environment) contributes to the development of phenotypic syndromes in coyote pups. Our results suggest that parental habituation may be an ecological cue for offspring to reduce their fear response, thus emphasizing the role of parental plasticity in shaping their pups' behavioral and hormonal responses toward humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018,8,24,,,,,12965,12980,,10.1002/ece3.4741,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Yet energetic constraints on movement imposed by the physical landscape have only been considered separately from those imposed by risk avoidance, limiting our understanding of how short-term movement decisions scale up to affect long-term space use. Here, we integrate the costs of both physical terrain and predation risk into a common currency, energy, and then quantify their effects on the short-term movement and long-term spatial ecology of a large carnivore living in a human-dominated landscape. Using high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data from collared pumas (Puma concolor), we calculated the short-term (i.e., 5-min) energetic costs of navigating both rugged physical terrain and a landscape of risk from humans (major sources of both mortality and fear for our study population). Both the physical and risk landscapes affected puma short-term movement costs, with risk having a relatively greater impact by inducing high-energy but low-efficiency movement behavior. The cumulative effects of short-term movement costs led to reductions of 29% to 68% in daily travel distances and total home range area. For male pumas, long-term patterns of space use were predominantly driven by the energetic costs of human-induced risk.

Despite recent conceptual advances and potential management implications of the ecology of fear, theory and conservation practices have rarely been linked. Many challenges in animal conservation may be alleviated by actively harnessing or compensating for risk perception and risk avoidance behavior in wild animal populations. Integration of the ecology of fear into conservation and management practice can contribute to the recovery of threatened populations, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, invasive species management, maintenance of sustainable harvest and species reintroduction plans. Here, we present an applied framework that links conservation interventions to desired outcomes by manipulating ecology of fear dynamics. We discuss how to reduce or amplify fear in wild animals by manipulating habitat structure, sensory stimuli, animal experience (previous exposure to risk) and food safety trade-offs to achieve management objectives. Changing the optimal decision-making of individuals in managed populations can then further conservation goals by shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of animals, changing predation rates and altering risk effects that scale up to demographic consequences. We also outline future directions for applied research on fear ecology that will better inform conservation practices. Our framework can help scientists and practitioners anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences of management decisions, and highlight new levers for multi-species conservation strategies that promote human-wildlife coexistence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021,24,3,,,,,308,321,,10.1111/acv.12629,,AUG 2020,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Exposure to human activity can cause animals to avoid human dominated areas or shift temporal activity patterns, but repeated, benign exposure can also result in habituation of individuals. Habituation is typically viewed as a negative potential consequence of human interactions with wildlife, with effects such as increased vulnerability of habituated animals to predation. Concurrently, the advancement of the understanding of the ecology of fear has shown reduced fitness in species because of behavioral changes in responses to fear of predators including humans. Here, we test how habituation and fear drive the foraging ecology of brown bears (Ursus arctos) feeding on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Southeast Alaska, USA. We used motion-detecting trail cameras at salmon spawning areas across a gradient of human disturbance to record human and bear activity at fine spatial and extended temporal scales. Higher human activity was associated with increased nocturnality of non-habituated bears, likely leading to suboptimal foraging, but had no effect on habituated individuals. For the top 20% of sites for which human activity was greatest, an average of 78.7% of the activity of non habituated bears was nocturnal, compared with an average of only 10.2% of the activity of habituated individuals. Habituation of brown bears in this system alleviated perceived risk and avoidance of human activity, allowing habituated individuals to overcome their fear of human presence and maximize foraging opportunities. While habituation may lessen some of the deleterious effects of human activity on large carnivores, the long-term effects of habituation may be negative, as habituated individuals may be at greater risk of depredation. Future research should examine whether habituated bears and their lower perceived risk of human activity ultimately experience smaller population-level effects of human disturbance than non-habituated individuals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2016,7,7,,,,,,,e01408,10.1002/ecs2.1408,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Studies indicate that cat odor and trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a synthetic compound isolated from fox feces, are often presented to rodents to induce fear-related responses including freezing, avoidance, stress hormone and, in some tests, risk assessment behavior. Furthermore, we report that different amounts of cat odor impregnated on small-, medium-, or large-sized cloths impact the display of fear-related behavior when presented to rats. That is, rats exposed to a large cat odor containing cloth exhibit an increase in fear behavior, particularly freezing, which remains at high levels in habituation tests administered over a period of 7 days. The large cloth also induces a long-lasting increase in avoidance behavior during repeated habituation and extinction tests. A review of the brain regions involved in predator odor-induced fear behavior indicates a modulatory role of the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and dorsal premammillary nucleus. In addition, the basolateral amygdala is involved in fear behavior induced by cat odor but not TMT, and the central amygdala does not appear to play a major behavioral role in predator odor-induced fear. Future research involving the use of predator odor is likely to rapidly expand knowledge on the neurobiology of fear, which has implications for understanding fear-related psychopathology.

Fear is a defensive mechanism evolved to protect animals from danger by balancing the animals' needs for primary resources with the risk of predation, and the amygdala is implicated in mediating fear responses. However, the functions of fear and amygdala in foraging behavior are not well characterized because of the technical difficulty in quantifying prey-predator interaction with real (unpredictable) predators. Thus, the present study investigated the rat's foraging behavior in a seminaturalistic environment when confronted with a predator-like robot programmed to surge toward the animal seeking food. Rats initially fled into the nest and froze (demonstrating fear) and then cautiously approached and seized the food as a function of decreasing nest-food and increasing food-robot distances. The likelihood of procuring food increased and decreased via lesioning/inactivating and disinhibiting the amygdala, respectively. These results indicate that the amygdala bidirectionally regulates risk behavior in rats foraging in a dynamic fear environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 14,2010,107,50,,,,,21773,21777,,10.1073/pnas.1010079108,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Yet fear effects are not always the predominant driver of predator-prey interactions. Thus, guiding ecological principles have not been assembled to explain the broader food web interactions that shape the context dependency of carnivore-livestock conflict. We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework as a way to think about the contingencies under which inducing non-consumptive 'fear effects' on predators would be effective to mitigate carnivore-livestock conflict. The framework specifically considers interactions among wildlife (carnivore predators, wild ungulate prey) and humans (people and livestock) in terms of spatial predator-prey assemblages in which the nature of wildlife-human interactions - as either a carnivore-livestock conflict or a coexistence food web - is contingent on the nature of spatial movement and overlap of humans and wildlife across landscapes. Considering human-wildlife interactions within such a spatial food web context can assist in enabling people and wildlife, especially imperiled carnivores, to coexist in human-modified landscapes. The framework offers predictions that should be tested via adaptive management experiments that evaluate whether conflict mitigation solutions aligned with particular spatial human-livestock-carnivore contexts do indeed resolve conflict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,236,,,,,,464,473,,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.06.009,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Human disturbance also induces costly non-lethal effects by changing the behavior of risk-averse animals. Here, we suggest that the unique strength of these lethal and non-lethal effects is amplified by mismatches between the nature of risk associated with anthropogenic stimuli and the corresponding response by wild animals. We discuss the unique characteristics of cues associated with anthropogenic stimuli in the context of animal ecology and evolutionary history to explore why and when animals fail to appropriately (a) detect, (b) assess, and (c) respond to both benign and lethal stimuli.

However, it has not been sufficiently examined whether other arthropods similarly elicit fear or disgust. Our aim was to examine if all arthropods are rated similarly, if only potentially dangerous arthropods (spiders, bees/wasps) elicit comparable responses, or if spiders are rated in a unique way. We presented pictures of arthropods (15 spiders, 15 beetles, 15 bees/wasps, and 15 butterflies/moths) to 76 students who rated each picture for fear, disgust, and how dangerous they thought the animal is. They also categorized each animal into one of the four animal groups. In addition, we assessed the participants' fear of spiders and estimates for trait anxiety. The ratings showed that spiders elicit significantly greater fear and disgust than any other arthropod group, and spiders were rated as more dangerous. Fear and disgust ratings of spider pictures significantly predicted the questionnaire scores for fear of spiders, whereas dangerousness ratings of spiders and ratings of other arthropods do not provide any predictive power. Thus, spider fear is in fact spider specific. Our results demonstrate that potential harmfulness alone cannot explain why spiders are feared so frequently. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, in addition to direct effects, it has been shown that indirect (non-lethal) effects of predation risk are predominant in many populations. Predation risk is often structured in space and time, generating a heterogeneous landscape of fear within which animals can minimize risks by modifying their habitat use. Furthermore, for ungulates, resource quality seems to be positively correlated with human-related sources of risk. We studied the trade-off between access to resources of high-quality and risk-taking by contrasting habitat use of roe deer during daytime with that during nighttime for 94 roe deer in a hunted population. Our first hypothesis was that roe deer should avoid human disturbance by modifying their habitat use during daytime compared to nighttime. Our results supported this, as roe deer mainly used open fields during nighttime, but used more forested habitats during daytime, when human disturbance is higher. Moreover, we found that diel patterns in habitat use were influenced by hunting disturbance. Indeed, the roe deer decreased their use of high-crops during daytime, an important source of cover and food, during the hunting season. The proximity of roads and dwellings also affected habitat use, since roe deer used open fields during daytime to a greater extent when the distance to these sources of disturbance was higher. Hence, our results suggest that roe deer resolve the trade-off between the acquisition of high-quality resources and risk avoidance by modifying their habitat use between day and night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2013,59,2,,,,,185,193,,10.1007/s10344-012-0665-8,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Although much research has centered upon the idea that individuals can adaptively modify their behaviors to cope with environmental changes, recent evidence supports the existence of individual differences in suites of correlated behaviors. However, little is known about how selection can change these behavioral structures in populations subject to different environmental constraints. The colonization of urban environments by birds has been related to their inter-individual variability in their fear of humans, measured as their flight initiation distance to an approaching human, such that urban life would select for fearless individuals. This behavior has been demonstrated to be heritable and highly consistent throughout the adult lifespan of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). Here, we experimentally assessed, in field conditions, whether urban life involves changes in other behaviors such as exploration and antipredatory response through their correlation with fear of humans. Breeding urban birds were more fearless toward humans and were quicker to explore a new food resource and defend their nests from predators than their rural counterparts. However, while fear of humans positively correlated with exploration and antipredatory response in the rural population, it only correlated with exploration in the urban one. Predator release in urban environments could relax- and even counterselect-antipredator behaviors, thus dismantling the behavioral correlation existent in natural populations. Altogether, our results suggest that rural and urban animals may differ in some behavioral aspects, may be as a consequence of the selection processes acting during the colonization of urban areas as well as the different ecological environments encountered by individuals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 31,2017,5,,,,,,,,54,10.3389/fevo.2017.00054,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The SOS attempts to merge ecological models that define a repertoire of contextually relevant threat induced survival behaviors with contemporary approaches to human affective science. We first propose that the goal of the nervous system is to reduce surprise and optimize actions by (i) predicting the sensory landscape by simulating possible encounters with threat and selecting the appropriate pre-encounter action and (ii) prevention strategies in which the organism manufactures safe environments. When a potential threat is encountered the (iii) threat orienting system is engaged to determine whether the organism ignores the stimulus or switches into a process of (iv) threat assessment, where the organism monitors the stimulus, weighs the threat value, predicts the actions of the threat, searches for safety, and guides behavioral actions crucial to directed escape. When under imminent attack, (v) defensive systems evoke fast reflexive indirect escape behaviors (i.e., fight or flight). This cascade of responses to threat of increasing magnitude are underwritten by an interconnected neural architecture that extends from cortical and hippocampal circuits, to attention, action and threat systems including the amygdala, striatum, and hard wired defensive systems in the midbrain. The SOS also includes a modulatory feature consisting of cognitive appraisal systems that flexibly guide perception, risk and action. Moreover, personal and vicarious threat encounters fine-tune avoidance behaviors via model-based learning, with higher organisms bridging data to reduce face-to-face encounters with predators. Our model attempts to unify the divergent field of human affective science, proposing a highly integrated nervous system that has evolved to increase the organism's chances of survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 18,2015,9,,,,,,,,,10.3389/fnins.2015.00055,,,,,,Neurosciences & Neurology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Predator threats change across an animal's lifetime, as do abilities that enable the animal to learn or engage in different defensive behaviors. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the combination of factors that successfully induce unlearned fear to predator odor across development. Infant, juvenile, adolescent, and adult rats were exposed to one of the three odor stimuli (control odor, cat urine, or cat fur) in either a small or large chamber. Though all ages displayed fear-related behavior to cat odors, differences were reflected only in freezing behavior and not, as expected, risk-assessment. Infant and juvenile animals also increased freezing to cat urine compared to the control odor, possibly because these age groups possess limited defensive options to cope with threat and so may respond with freezing to all predator stimuli. Unexpectedly, chamber size had no effect on either freezing or risk-assessment in this study. Once the parameters of unconditioned fear are understood, they can be exploited to develop a learning paradigm to predator odors that could be used in early life. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we combined puma GPS tracking data with field experiments to understand the extent to which anthropogenic development has cascading impacts from pumas to plants. We examined spatial patterns in puma feeding sites and found that pumas preferentially kill deer away (>340 m) from human development. This aversion appears to create refugia for deer, as deer more than doubled their relative activity near (<70 m) human development. In addition, deer more than quadrupled their consumption of woody vegetation at low-risk sites close to humans relative to comparable high-risk sites far from humans and consumed a greater percent of the forage available in sites near humans than in comparable sites farther away. Increased browsing by deer in near human, or low-risk, sites induced woody plants to become bushier (by removing apical dominance) than those away from humans, or high-risk sites.

Extensive research has examined the consequences of predation risk from large carnivores on the behavior of wild ungulate prey species. However, many large carnivores not only hunt wild prey but also depredate domestic livestock, especially in pastoralist systems where livestock share land and resources with large carnivores. Northern Tanzania is a hotspot for human-carnivore conflict driven by livestock depredation and interactions are particularly severe between African lions Panthera leo and pastoralist cattle Bos taurus. In this ecosystem, we explored the degree to which pastoralist cattle exhibited anti-predator behaviors during their daily grazing routines. Using focal animal sampling, we compared two typical anti-predator behaviors, vigilance and grouping, among cattle in village rangelands with high and low background depredation rates. We found that cattle in high risk village rangelands formed 21.2% larger groups than cattle in low risk village rangelands. Interestingly, cattle in low risk village rangelands spent 68.4% more time vigilant than cattle in high risk village rangelands. These patterns were influenced significantly by the time of day: as sunset approached, cattle in low risk village rangelands spent more time vigilant and cattle in high risk village rangelands formed larger groups. These results suggest that pastoralist cattle exhibit anti-predator strategies that vary both spatially and temporally, and that such strategies might help livestock optimally tradeoff the costs and benefits of anti-predator behavior across timescales (i.e. the risk allocation hypothesis). We discuss the implications of our results for husbandry techniques that might reduce behavioral costs associated with cattle anti-predator behaviors and help increase tolerance for lions and other large carnivores. These improvements are critical to human-carnivore coexistence given the prevalence of pastoralism globally and the rising potential for conflict with large carnivores such as lions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021,130,3,,,,,422,430,,10.1111/oik.07965,,DEC 2020,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Different tactics such as ambush, stalking, and pursuit may lead to spatially heterogeneous distributions of predation risk. Studying how such a landscape of risk looks in a multi-predator setting has become topical in light of the re-colonization of apex predators in areas with extensive human harvesting.

The extent to which hunters vary tactics resulting in a spatial pattern of risk to ungulate prey has never been quantified. By comparing habitat characteristics between kill sites and sites used by GPS-marked roe deer, we quantified the landscape of risk as experienced by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) exposed to predation by both Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and humans using different hunting tactics in southeastern Norway. Lynx killed roe deer in denser habitat than roe deer used on average, while humans killed most roe deer in open terrain. However, humans used multiple hunting tactics, and habitat characteristics varied predictably between drive hunts conducted with rifle versus shotgun, and between stalking versus sit and wait hunts with a rifle. Vegetation density was higher where roe deer were shot during drive hunts with a shotgun and during stalking than when shot during drive hunting with a rifle or during sit and wait hunts. Shooting distance was shortest for drive hunts with a shotgun, similar for drive hunts with a rifle and stalking, and considerably longer during sit and wait hunting. Managers therefore have the possibility to create different risk landscapes by restricting types of weapons and types of hunting tactic allowed, also in combination with the duration of the hunting season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2015,61,6,,,,,831,840,,10.1007/s10344-015-0959-8,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We installed 189 cameras under fruit trees in six areas of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, that differ in the abundance of top predators and large frugivores. Small predators and small frugivores were more frequent at night while large frugivores were more frequent during the day, but small frugivores visited and spent less time at fruiting trees on brighter nights, unlike large predators and large frugivores. Small frugivores also were less frequent in areas with high visitation by large frugivores and more frequent in highly defaunated areas.

At a highly seasonal and human-modified site, we predicted that arboreal samango monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus) would show highly flexible, responsive, risk-sensitive foraging. We first determined how monkeys use horizontal and vertical space across seasons to evaluate if high-risk decisions (use of gardens and ground) changed with season, a proxy for starvation risk. Then, during a subsequent winter, we offered equal feeding opportunities (in the form of high-value, raw peanuts) in both gardens and forest to see if this short-term change in food availability and starvation risk affected monkeys' foraging decisions. We found that during the food-scarce winter, monkeys foraged outside indigenous forest and in gardens, where they fed on exotic species, especially fallen acorns (Quercus spp.), despite potential threats from humans. Nevertheless, and as predicted, when given the choice of foraging on high-value foods in gardens vs. forest during our artificial foraging experiment, monkeys showed a preference for a safer forest habitat. Our experiment also indicated monkeys' sensitivity to risk in the lower vertical strata of both habitats, despite their previous extensive use of the ground.

This can be studied in risk perception during movement in relation to specific habitat types, whereby individuals trade-off between foraging and disturbance. Due to its high behavioral plasticity and increasing occurrence in urban environments, wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an excellent model organism to study adjustment to urbanization. With the help of GPS tracking, space use of 11 wild boar from Berlin's metropolitan region was analyzed: we aimed at understanding how animals adjust space use to deal with the landscape of fear in urban areas compared to rural areas. We compared use vs. availability with help of generalized linear mixed models. First, we studied landscape types selected by rural vs. urban wild boar, second, we analyzed distances of wild boar locations to each of the landscape types. Finally, we mapped the resulting habitat selection probability to predict hotspots of human-wildlife conflicts. A higher tolerance to disturbance in urban wild boar was shown by a one third shorter flight distance and by an increased re-use of areas close to the trap. Urban wild boar had a strong preference for natural landscapes such as swamp areas, green areas and deciduous forests, and areas with high primary productivity, as indicated by high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) values. The areas selected by urban wild boar were often located closely to roads and houses. The spatial distribution maps show that a large area of Berlin would be suitable for urban wild boar but not their rural conspecifics, with the most likely reason being a different perception of anthropogenic disturbance. Wild boar therefore showed considerable behavioral plasticity suitable to adjust to human-dominated environments in a potentially evolutionarily adaptive manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 6,2017,5,,,,,,,,157,10.3389/fevo.2017.00157,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

When hunted, however, they may have to adjust their behaviour further or differently to cope with this additional mortality risk. Here, we investigated whether African large ungulates would adjust their behaviour in response to hunting risk (i.e. risk of being shot by human hunters). We predicted that they would shift their use of surface water, a key and scarce resource in African savannas, from day hours to night hours to reduce the risk of encountering human hunters. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to record the temporal drinking niche of three nonhunted ungulates (i.e. impala, Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, sable antelope, Hippotragus niger). We also monitored waterholes in hunting areas in the vicinity of Hwange National Park. In Hwange National Park, the three species avoided waterholes at night, when the risk of natural predation was higher. Conversely, in the hunting areas, all three species visited waterholes more often at night. Impala and greater kudu, however, were less prone to switch towards night-time use of waterholes in hunting areas compared to sable antelope, although all three species were exposed to similar hunting risk. Our results suggest that hunting may force African ungulates to shift their visits at waterholes from day hours towards night hours, but that the magnitude of this shift may be constrained by the predation risk imposed by large nocturnal carnivores. We conclude that species preyed upon by natural predators adjust their antipredator behaviour in response to the additional risk of predation imposed by hunting.

Subsequent to the return of large carnivores to human-modified ecosystems, many prey species have adjusted their spatial behaviour to the contrasting landscapes of fear generated by both their natural predators and anthropogenic pressures. The effects of predation risk on temporal shifts in diel activity of prey, however, remain largely unexplored in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the influence of the density of lynx Lynx lynx, a nocturnal predator, on the diel activity patterns of their main prey, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus, across a gradient of human disturbance and hunting at the European scale. Based on 11 million activity records from 431 individually GPS-monitored roe deer in 12 populations within the EURODEER network (), we investigated how lynx predation risk in combination with both lethal and non-lethal human activities affected the diurnality of deer. We demonstrated marked plasticity in roe deer diel activity patterns in response to spatio-temporal variations in risk, mostly due to human activities. In particular, roe deer decreased their level of diurnality by a factor of 1.37 when the background level of general human disturbance was high. Hunting exacerbated this effect, as during the hunting season deer switched most of their activity to night-time and, to a lesser extent, to dawn, although this pattern varied noticeably in relation to lynx density. Indeed, in the presence of lynx, their main natural predator, roe deer were relatively more diurnal. Overall, our results revealed a strong influence of human activities and the presence of lynx on diel shifts in roe deer activity. In the context of the recovery of large carnivores across Europe, we provide important insights about the effects of predators on the behavioural responses of their prey in human-dominated ecosystems. Modifications in the temporal partitioning of ungulate activity as a response to human activities may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence, but likely also have knock-on effects for predator-prey interactions, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,89,1,,,,,132,145,,10.1111/1365-2656.13161,,DEC 2019,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

These traditional paradigms measure a limited selection of variables over a short duration, providing only a snapshot of fear and anxiety-related behavior. Overreliance on these paradigms and such behavioral snapshots ultimately lead to a narrow understanding of these complex motivational states. Here, we elaborate on the closed economy; a seldom-used paradigm that has been modified to comprehensively study fear and anxiety-related behavior and neurocircuitry in rodents. In this modified Risky Closed Economy (RCE) paradigm, animals live nearly uninterrupted in behavioral chambers where the need to acquire food and water and avoid threat is integrated into the task. Briefly, animals are free to acquire all of their food and water in a designated foraging zone. An unsignaled, unpredictable threat (footshock) is introduced into the foraging zone after a baseline activity and consumption period to model the risk of predation, which is then removed for a final extinction assessment. This longitudinal design, wherein data from a multitude of variables are collected automatically and continuously for 23 h/day over several weeks to months, affords a more holistic understanding of the effects of fear and anxiety on day-to-day behavior. Also, we discuss its general benefits relevant to other topics in neuroscience research, its limitations, and present data demonstrating for the first time The Risky Closed Economy's viability in mice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 23,2020,14,,,,,,,,594568,10.3389/fnbeh.2020.594568,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

In non-urban systems, passerines often respond to predator cues by reducing parental investment, resulting in smaller and lighter nestlings. Since trophic interactions in urban areas are highly altered, it is unclear how passerines respond to fear effects in human-altered landscapes. Nestlings of passerines in urban areas also tend to be smaller and lighter than their rural counterparts and are often exposed to high densities of potential predators yet experience lower per capita predation-the predation paradox. We suggest fear effects in urban habitats could be a significant mechanism influencing nestling condition in birds, despite lowered predation rates. We manipulated exposure of nesting birds to adult-consuming predator risk in residential yards across a gradient of urbanization to determine the relative influence of urbanization and fear on nestling condition. We found nestlings had reduced mass in nests exposed to predator playbacks as well as in more urban areas. Despite lower per capita predation rates in urban areas, fear effects from increased predator densities may influence passerine fitness through reduced nestling condition.

To date few studies have assessed the spatiotemporal trade-off between resource acquisition and avoidance of risks and human disturbance in small protected areas embedded in an urban matrix. A better understanding of the forage-safety trade-off in urban protected areas (UPA) is key to the design of evidence based approaches to deal with the ever-increasing human-wildlife impacts typical of UPA. Herein, we analyzed camera trap data to evaluate how two ungulate species trade fear for food in a 60 km(2) human-dominated UPA without natural predators. We found that wild boar (Sus scrofa) were predominantly active at night, while roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) showed a typical bimodal crepuscular activity pattern. Occupancy analysis indicated that deciduous forest and the presence of high seats for hunting played an important role in determining the space use of wild boar. For roe deer, we found indications that the presence of forest influenced space use, although the null model was retained among the top ranked models.

Prey species are often faced with a tradeoff between food and safety in situations where food availability and predation risk peak in the same habitat type. Determining the optimal strategy becomes more complex if predators with different hunting mode create contrasting landscapes of risk, but this has rarely been documented in vertebrates. Roe deer in southeastern Norway face predation risk from lynx, as well as hunting by humans. These two predators differ greatly in their hunting methods. The predation risk from lynx, an efficient stalk-and-ambush predator is expected to be higher in areas with dense understory vegetation, while predation risk from human hunters is expected to be higher where visual sight lines are longer. Based on field observations and airborne LiDAR data from 71 lynx predation sites, 53 human hunting sites, 132 locations from 15 GPS-marked roe deer, and 36 roe deer pellet locations from a regional survey, we investigated how predation risk was related to terrain attributes and vegetation classes/structure. As predicted, we found that increasing cover resulted in a contrasting lower predation risk from humans and higher predation risk from lynx. Greater terrain ruggedness increased the predation risk from both predators. Hence, multiple predators may create areas of contrasting risk as well as double risk in the same landscape. Our study highlights the complexity of predator-prey relationship in a multiple predator setting. Synthesis In this study of risk effects in a multi-predator context, LiDAR data were used to quantify cover in the habitat and relate it to vulnerability to predation in a boreal forest. We found that lynx and human hunters superimpose generally contrasting landscapes of fear on a common prey species, but also identified double-risk zones. Since the benefit of anti-predator responses depends on the combined risk from all predators, it is necessary to consider complete predator assemblages to understand the potential for and occurrence of risk effects across study systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2014,123,6,,,,,641,651,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00938.x,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The aim of this study was to determine how the risks of predation and heat stress influenced their behavior while feeding on a key food, fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata). Materials and Methods: Proximity of fruiting baobab trees to anthropogenic landmarks were compared to food intake, feeding rate, and behavioral indicators of fear in adult males (N = 11) at Fongoli. Additionally, we compared foraging to vegetative habitats, baobab ripe fruit nutritive quality, surface water availability, and foraging party composition. Results: Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead, risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of heat stress. Conclusions: Adaptations that minimize predation risk are widespread in mammalian prey species, but these traits are poorly understood in chimpanzees. Great apes encounter few nonhuman predators capable of successfully capturing and killing them; thus, such events are rarely observed. Although people rarely hunt chimpanzees in Senegal, we found that adult males perceived humans as predators and adjusted their behavior while foraging in risky habitats.

Roe deer were extremely vigilant in response to the predator olfactory cue; however, roe deer vigilance did not differ measurably among areas with or without potential lynx presence. Deer were more vigilant before sunset than during the night at both study areas, probably due to long-term adaptation of roe deer to human hunting during daytime. Vigilance decreased from August to September even though activity of lynx increases in autumn, which may be a result either of increased foraging due to decrease in food quality in autumn, or of changes in social organization of the deer. Our results suggested that the degree of vigilance depends on environmental cues. We found that roe deer respond to lynx urine despite a long absence of lynx in the ecosystem.

Here, we investigate the influence of human-induced fear on puma foraging behaviour using location and prey consumption data from 30 tagged individuals living along a gradient of human development. We observed strong behavioural responses by female pumas to human development, whereby their fidelity to kill sites and overall consumption time of prey declined with increasing housing density by 36 and 42%, respectively. Females responded to this decline in prey consumption time by increasing the number of deer they killed in high housing density areas by 36% over what they killed in areas with little residential development. The loss of food from declines in prey consumption time paired with increases in energetic costs associated with killing more prey may have consequences for puma populations, particularly with regard to reproductive success. In addition, greater carcass availability is likely to alter community dynamics by augmenting food resources for scavengers.

We experimentally tested whether introducing trained Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) through falconry could be an effective management tool to reduce nuisance Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca). We hypothesized that falconry would result in elevated fear responses of geese, resulting in increased vigilance, reduced favorability of the site, and locally reduced abundance. We conducted our study on 3 golf courses (1 treatment and 2 controls) in the Western Cape, South Africa, where Egyptian geese are a pest species. Our treatment involved flying the Harris's hawk directly at geese from golf carts. We monitored vigilance and goose numbers before, during, and after treatment. Goose vigilance at the treatment site increased by 76% and abundance declined by 73% following falconry. We did not observe changes at either control site. Although the hawks killed some geese, the decreases in abundance were almost 3 times greater than the numbers killed, indicating that indirect effects were considerably larger than the direct effect of mortality. During the treatment period, vigilance rates were greater in the presence of a golf cart, suggesting that geese learned to associate carts with the threat of predation. Post-treatment vigilance rates were significantly less than rates detected during the treatment period and goose abundance on the experimental site increased rapidly post-treatment, returning to pre-treatment rates within 2 months.

Lewis rats were subjected to classical auditory fear conditioning before or after exposure to a predatory threat that mimics a type of traumatic stress that leads to PTSD in humans. Exploratory behavior on the elevated plus maze 1 wk after predatory threat exposure was used to distinguish resilient vs. PTSD-like rats. Properties of extinction varied depending on whether fear conditioning and extinction occurred before or after predatory threat. When fear conditioning was carried out after predatory threat, PTSD-like rats showed a marked extinction deficit compared with resilient rats. In contrast, no differences were seen between resilient and PTSD-like rats when fear conditioning and extinction occurred prior to predatory threat.

Fear can be innate or learned. Whereas the neural circuits underlying learned fear are already well investigated, the knowledge about the circuits mediating innate fear is still limited. We here used a novel, unbiased approach to image in vivo the spatial patterns of neural activity in odor-induced innate fear behavior in rats. We intravenously injected awake unrestrained rats with a 99m-technetium labeled blood flow tracer (99mTc-HMPAO) during ongoing exposure to fox urine or water as control, and mapped the brain distribution of the trapped tracer using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Upon fox urine exposure blood flow increased in a number of brain regions previously associated with odor-induced innate fear such as the amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamus and dorsolateral periaqueductal grey, but, unexpectedly, decreased at higher significance levels in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). Significant flow changes were found in regions monosynaptically connected to the IPN. Flow decreased in the dorsal tegmentum and entorhinal cortex. Flow increased in the habenula (Hb) and correlated with odor effects on behavioral defensive strategy. Hb lesions reduced avoidance of but increased approach to the fox urine while IPN lesions only reduced avoidance behavior without approach behavior. Our study identifies a new component, the IPN, of the neural circuit mediating odor-induced innate fear behavior in mammals and suggests that the evolutionarily conserved Hb-IPN system, which has recently been implicated in cued fear, also forms an integral part of the innate fear circuitry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 14,2017,332,,,,,,164,171,,10.1016/j.bbr.2017.05.053,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

For a prey animal in the wild, such as a sheep, behavioural responses have evolved to evade detection and capture by predators. The behavioural responses of the wild ancestors of domestic sheep to the threat of predation are characterised predominantly by vigilance, flocking, flight to cover and behavioural inhibition once refuge has been reached Some limited defensive behaviours are seen, mainly in females with young against small predators. Vigilance and flight distance are affected by the animal's assessment of risk and are influenced by the environment social group size, age, sex and reproductive condition, as well as by previous experience with potential predators. Under conditions of stress, domestic sheep show similar behavioural reactions to wild sheep, although the threshold at which they are elicited may be elevated. This is particularly evident when comparing less selected hill breeds with more highly selected lowland breeds, and suggests that a continuum of responsiveness exists between wild and feral sheep, through hill breeds to the lowland sheep breeds. However, this may be confounded by the previous experience of the breeds, particularly their familiarity with humans. Behavioural and neurobiological evidence suggests that although the behavioural response to predators (vigilance, flight) is innate, the stimuli that elicit this behavioural pattern may have a learned component. Since vigilance and flight distances are affected by the animal's perception of threat, they may be useful indices of stress in sheep and, as graded responses, give some indication of the level of threat experienced by the sheep. Thus they may indicate the amount of fear or distress experienced by the sheep and hence have the potential to be used in the assessment of welfare states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2004,13,3,,,,,269,281,,,,,,,,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The freezing response is represented by a motionless moment without any specific posture or behavioral sequence, and it is widely used in the fear conditioning paradigms and other relevant defensive situations. However, freezing measurements include fragmental components of several defensive behaviors that are exhibited during the session, such as behavioral inhibition, crouching, and a moment of risk assessment behavior. From an ethological view, behavioral analyses of C57BL/6 mice of both sexes and three different ages (postnatal days (P) 25, 35, and 65) revealed a rich variety of defensive behaviors during a fear conditioning session and in response to predatory odor exposure as a nonconditioned behavior. P-25 and 35 mice exhibited more behavioral inhibition than P-65 adult mice, and P-65 mice exhibited a crouching posture more often than younger mice. This age difference was more pronounced in males. The stretch-attend posture (SAP) increased with age, except in P-25 males, which exhibited robust SAP in response to a conditioned cue; this response indicates that P-25 males are defensive in a situation-nonmatching manner. Situation-dependent defense strategies were revealed in P-35 and 65 mice: Fear conditioning paradigm induced more robust defensive responses than predatory odor exposure, to which mice primarily exhibited SAP. A sex-based difference was revealed in adult mice. Males tended to show more passive defensive responses, such as crouching and withdrawal, and females exhibited more active responses, such as SAP. These age- and sex-based differences may stem from the ethological demands and illustrate adolescent ontogenetic processes of defense behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 15,2019,204,,,,,,264,274,,10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.02.030,,,,,,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

When exposure reveals that a stimulus is associated with a cost, fearful behavior should increase. Conversely, neophobic fear should decrease when negative outcomes do not regularly follow the stimulus. Because exposure to anthropogenic stimuli is more common in birds that inhabit urbanized landscapes, their fear response patterns should more accurately reflect the risks associated with these stimuli. We conducted a series of feeder and playback experiments to explore whether urbanization altered black-capped chickadees' (Poecile atricapillus) fear responses to model cats, humans, a novel object, and anthropogenic noise. We predicted that fearful responses to cat models would increase in birds as urbanization increased because negative interactions with cats are more common in the city. However, we expected urban birds to be less fearful of our other stimuli because fitness costs are absent or less severe. As predicted, the fear of cats increased with urbanization, but the fear of noise decreased - as indicated by willingness to visit a feeding station. Other stimuli were not associated with urbanization, which may be related to the use of county and city parks where human presence is relatively common. Nonetheless, our results suggest that plastic fear responses to novel stimuli may facilitate urban success in the black-capped chickadee. More generally, behavioral plasticity may indicate the ability of a species to thrive in the urban environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018,21,6,,,,,1043,1051,,10.1007/s11252-018-0783-5,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Temporal avoidance of interspecific aggression can enable access to resources without spatial exclusion. Apex predators, including humans, can affect mesopredator activity patterns. Human context might also modify temporal interactions between predators. We explored activity patterns, nocturnality and the effects of human activity upon a guild of carnivores (grey wolf, Canis lupus; Eurasian lynx, Lynx lynx; red fox, Vulpes vulpes) using travel routes in Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia. Humans were diurnal, foxes nocturnal and large carnivores active during the night, immediately after sunrise and before sunset. Carnivore activity patterns overlapped greatly and to a similar extent for all pairings. Activity curves followed expectations based on interspecific killing, with activity peaks coinciding where body size differences were small (wolf and lynx) but not when they were intermediate (foxes to large carnivores). Carnivore activity, particularly fox, overlapped much less with that of diurnal humans. Foxes responded to higher large carnivore activity by being more nocturnal. Low light levels likely provide safer conditions by reducing the visual detectability of mesopredators. The nocturnal effect of large carnivores was however moderated and reduced by human activity. This could perhaps be due to temporal shielding or interference with risk cues. Subtle temporal avoidance and nocturnality may enable mesopredators to cope with interspecific aggression at shared spatial resources. Higher human activity moderated the effects of top-down temporal suppression which could consequently affect the trophic interactions of mesopredators.Significance statementTemporal partitioning can provide an important mechanism for spatial resource access and species coexistence. Our findings show that carnivores partition the use of shared travel routes in time, using the cover of darkness to travel safely where their suppressors (large carnivores) are more active. We however observed fox nocturnality to be flexible, with responses depending on the activity levels but also the composition of apex predators. High human activity modified the top-down temporal suppression of mesopredators by large carnivores. The use of time by predators can have demographic and trophic consequences. Prey accessibility and susceptibility can be temporally variable. As such, the ecosystem services and the ecological roles of predators may be affected by human time use as well as that of intraguild competitors. Temporal interactions should not be overlooked when evaluating human use and conservation priorities in protected areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 4,2020,74,5,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00265-020-02831-2,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

In adopting these behaviors, prey incur substantial non-consumptive costs that can have population-level consequences. Because prey knowledge of risk is imperfect, individuals may even adopt these costly behaviors in the absence of a real threat. For example, rather than only avoid hunters, many species categorically avoid all anthropogenic activity. Although hunting seasons only increase risk for specific individuals (e.g., males), non-target individuals may still perceive human hunters as a source of risk and respond accordingly. Here, we used a large-scale experiment including 89 animal-years of location data from 62 unique individuals over 6 yr to quantify the duration, magnitude, and energetic consequences of changes to movement and resource selection behavior adopted by non-target female elk (Cervus canadensis) in response to human hunters during three separate experimental 5-d hunts (elk archery, deer rifle (Odocoileus hemionus or Odocoileus virginianus), and elk rifle). We predicted that elk response to hunters would be brief, but that strong behavioral responses to hunters (e.g., strengthened avoidance of roads and trails) would carry nutritional costs. We measured the duration of hunt-related changes in elk speed using quantile regression, further quantified the strength of elk behavioral responses to hunters using population-level resource selection functions, and evaluated whether anti-predator resource selection behavior translated to measurable metabolic costs in the form of reduced body fat heading into winter. Elk responses to human hunters were stronger in the day than at night and were generally more pronounced during the elk hunts than during deer hunts. During hunts, elk shifted their diurnal behavior to avoid forage and intensified their avoidance of roads and trails. The combination of these changes in behavior led to a predicted pattern of distribution during the hunt that differed substantially from the distribution prior to the hunt. Lactating females that more strongly avoided roads entered winter in poorer nutritional condition, suggesting that the changes in resource selection we describe carry corresponding nutritional costs that have the potential to impact subsequent population performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,10,9,,,,,,,e02864,10.1002/ecs2.2864,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

To investigate the prevalence of problem behaviors in this breed, 94 Argentine Dogo owners provided information on aggressive and fearful behaviors shown by their dogs (83 males, 98 females) in a questionnaire. The results were consistent with the origin of the Argentine Dogo (i.e., descending from fighting dogs) and subsequent selection exerted to improve hunting qualities. Common aggressive behaviors included predation on small animals (92.0%), intra-specific conflicts (69.5%), and territoriality (i.e., vigilance of territory perimeter, 61.3%; aggression toward people visiting the dog's house, 45.3%; vigilance while inside the owners' car, 33.1%). Aggression directed to the owner was marginally represented. Reactions to leashing, bathing, punishment, sleep disturbance, to), removal, and in other conflict situations occurred in less than 10% of the sample. Reactions to food removal (13.3%) and handling (19.8%) showed higher prevalence. Chasing cars/running people (17.6%) and aggression toward strangers, either those who were friendly (19.1%) or those who seemed threatening on approach (29.4%), were noted. Low anxiety levels reported in social situations confirmed that these reactions were not common (e.g.. fear of strangers, children, and unfamiliar dogs <= 10%). Common anxious behaviors were fear of traffic (10.3%), loud noises (36.2%), startling stimuli (30.5%), destructiveness (42.9%), excessive body licking (13.6%), and shyness in novel situations (32.4%). The context and targets of aggression when exhibited by these dogs (e.g., aggression toward animals when outside the dogs' territory, aggression towards people when inside territory) suggest that the Italian law on potentially dangerous dog breeds may be ineffective in preventing Argentine Dogos' aggression to humans. Social hazards could be reduced by promoting proper social exposure and reactions toward people. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Behavioral responses of prey in relation to large carnivore predation risk have mainly been conducted in areas with low anthropogenic impact. We used long-term data on the distribution of moose in different habitat types in a system characterized by intensive management of all three trophic levels (silviculture, harvest of wolves and moose) to study effects on moose habitat selection resulting from the return of an apex predator, the wolf. We assumed that coursing predators such as wolves will cause an increased risk for moose in some habitat types and tested the hypotheses that moose will avoid open or young forest habitats following wolf establishment. After wolf recolonization, moose reduced their use of one type of open habitat (bog) but there was neither change in the use of the other open habitat type (clear-cut), nor in their use of young forest. Wolf establishment did not influence the use of habitat close to dense habitat when being in open habitats. Thus, the effect of wolves varied among habitat types and there was no unidirectional support for a behavioral effect of wolves' establishment on moose habitat use. Human-driven habitat heterogeneity, concentration of moose forage to certain habitat types, and the effects of a multiple predator guild on moose may all contribute to the results found. We conclude that the landscape of fear is likely to have weak ecological effects on moose in this system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,197,1,,,,,101,116,,10.1007/s00442-021-04984-x,,AUG 2021,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Increased vigilance may therefore indicate increased fear. We tested dairy cattle to determine whether time spent vigilant changed in response to the novelty of their location, the presence of a dog or the presence of an aversive, gentle or unfamiliar handler. We conducted 123 min trials per cow on 40 cows tested individually in a large outdoor enclosure containing an attractive food source. The feeders restricted the animal's view so that it could not feed and scan simultaneously, so vigilance time was defined as any time the animal's head was raised. During the initial trials, the degree of vigilance was high, but the amount of vigilance decreased significantly with number of trials. Time vigilant was significantly higher in the presence of a dog than in the presence of a human or when neither was present. In a second experiment, 20 cows, that had been trained to recognise an aversive and a gentle person for 3 weeks prior to testing, were tested in an indoor pen containing an attractive food source with the aversive, gentle, or an unfamiliar person nearby. The presence of the aversive person significantly increased vigilance time compared to the unfamiliar and gentle people. However, vigilance time did not decrease with repeated exposure to the enclosure, perhaps because the testing barn was already familiar. These results suggest that cows alter their vigilance according to their degree of fearfulness toward people and toward different environments, and that measures of vigilance may provide information on the degree of fearfulness of the animals.

Lions attacked over 1,000 people in Tanzania between 1990 and 2007. We conducted questionnaire surveys to examine multiple aspects of risk perceptions in the areas with the highest incidence of lion attacks, focusing on three general questions: (1) how villagers perceive their overall risk of attack; (2) what factors influence risk perceptions; and, (3) what aspects of risk are perceived accurately. Overall, people overestimated their risk from lions: 53% of respondents felt they are very likely to be attacked while the actual risk is estimated at less than 1% over an average lifespan. Risk perceptions were correlated with gender, age, education, acres of cultivated land and number of livestock owned but not with previous experience with lion attacks in either the village or family or with sighting of lions or lion signs. Nevertheless, people were very aware of who was at relatively high risk and when and where risks were greatest. People also accurately assessed the risk from lions compared with mega-herbivores but not compared with other predatory species or with disease and famine, emphasizing the tendency for people to overestimate risks that are rare but elicit strong fears.

As urban and adjacent environments are becoming increasingly valuable habitat for wildlife, it is important to understand how susceptible taxa, like small prey animals, persist in urban environments under such additional stressors. Here, in order to determine how small prey animals' foraging patterns change in response to habitat components and distances to predators and human disturbances, we used filmed giving-up density (GUD) trials under natural conditions along an urban disturbance gradient. We then ran further GUD trials with the addition of experimentally introduced stressors of: the odors of domestic cat (Felis catus)/red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as predator cues, light and sound as human disturbance cues, and their combinations. Small mammals were mostly observed foraging in the GUD trials, and to a lesser degree birds. Animals responded to proximity to predators and human disturbances when foraging under natural conditions, and used habitat components differently based on these distances. Along the urban disturbance gradient situation-specific responses were evident and differed under natural conditions compared to additional stressor conditions. The combined predator with human disturbance treatments resulted in responses of higher perceived risk at environments further from houses. Animals at the urban-edge environment foraged more across the whole site under the additional stressor conditions, but under natural conditions perceived less risk when foraging near predators and further from human disturbance (houses). Contrastingly, at the environments further from houses, foraging near human disturbance (paths/roads) when close to a predator was perceived as lower risk, but when foraging under introduced stressor conditions these disturbances were perceived as high risk. We propose that sensory and behavioral mechanisms, and stress exposure best explain our findings. Our results indicate that habitat components could be managed to reduce the impacts of high predation pressure and human activity in disturbed environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 3,2021,9,,,,,,,,750094,10.3389/fevo.2021.750094,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Fear of middle-predator affects the growth rate of prey and the fear of top-predator reduces the predation of middle-predator on prey species. The prey and middle-predator are assumed to take refuge against predation. Numerical results confirm the stabilizing role of refuge whereas hunting cooperation destroys stability and induces limit cycle oscillations. We find that the fear of middle-predator on prey has tendency to stabilize the system while the fear of top-predator on middle-predator creates instability in the system. Further, time delays are considered in the processes of taking refuges and hunting cooperations. Delay in hunting cooperations creates multiple stability switches in the system. Furthermore, seasonal forcing of parameters related to refuges and hunting cooperations depicts a more realistic scenario. We investigate the behaviors of seasonally forced system in the absence as well as presence of time delays. The seasonally forced system exhibits different types of periodic solutions. Complex bursting patterns are observed due to periodicity in refuge of middle-predator (cooperation of top-predator).

Despite the breadth of risky situations in nature that demand diversity in fear behaviors, contemporary neurobiological models of fear stem largely from Pavlovian fear conditioning studies that focus on how a particular cue becomes capable of eliciting learned fear responses, thus oversimplifying the brain's fear system.

In semi-natural situations affording a wide variety of responses, defensive behaviors change over time in response to information about the presence of danger, acquired through risk assessment activities. Two test batteries, a Fear/Defense Test Battery (F/DTB) measuring defensive behaviors to present, approaching predators, and an Anxiety/Defense Test Battery (A/DTB) measuring reactions to potential threat, have been used in conjunction with administration of potentially anxiolytic drugs. Results suggest that the F/DTB behaviors are not systematically responsive to anxiolytics. However, on the A/DTB, anxiolytic benzodiazepines produce a profile of effects primarily involving risk assessment activities. Very similar profiles of effect are seen also with some 5-HT1A compounds, alcohol, imipramine and MK-801, but not for a variety of additional compounds. A consistent pattern of gender differences are obtained with the A/DTB, with females more defensive than males.

Here, we investigate how humans modify deer space-use and their effects on vegetation at two spatial scales; zones with different types of human use (largescale risk factor) and, nested within that, trails (fine-scale risk factor). In zones with three contrasting types of human activities: 1) no recreation, no hunting, 2) with recreation, no hunting and 3) with recreation and hunting, we linked deer space-use (dropping counts) to browsing intensity, relative growth and survival of planted saplings. Plots were located at two distances to trails (20 versus 100 m) to test how trails affect deer space-use and sapling performance. Additionally, plots were distributed over forest and heathland as risk effects are habitat-dependent. Deer space-use was highest in the zone without recreation or hunting, resulting in higher browsing levels and lower sapling growth and survival, but only in heathland. In contrast, deer space-use and sapling performance did not differ between zones with recreation only and zones with recreation and hunting. Deer dropping counts were lower near trails used for recreation, but this was not associated with browsing impact or sapling performance. Our results show that recreational use modifies deer space-use which is associated with browsing impact on woody vegetation, while seasonal hunting activities in zones with recreation did not have additive year-round effects. Yet, effects were only observed at the larger scale of recreation zones and not near trails. Furthermore, deer space-use was only associated with sapling performance in open heathland, where high visibility presumably increases avoidance behaviour because it increases detectability and decreases escape possibilities. This suggests that recreation creates behaviourally mediated cascading effects that influence vegetation development, yet these effects are context-dependent.

Lions' ability to adjust their behaviour to reduce direct contact with humans may affect their survival. We used fine-scale GPS data to measure lions' response to humans at two scales: between land use types (commercial ranches versus pastoral lands) and with proximity to human-occupied locations (i.e. livestock enclosures: 'bomas') within commercial ranch land. Study lions on commercial ranches reacted to the location and activity levels of humans on the local scale, showing no overall spatial avoidance but fine-scale temporal partitioning in their use of areas in close proximity to bomas, being closest at times when human activity was lowest (i.e. between 2300 and 0500 hours). At the land use scale, however, lions showed significant (but not total) spatial avoidance of pastoral land, despite similar prey densities and habitat structure on both land use types, indicating that lions' ability to utilize pastoral land was limited by pastoral people. When lions did utilize pastoral land, they were more likely to do so during the dark hours, when people were confined to bomas, than during the daylight hours. Lions moved faster and straighter in pastoral lands and when close to bomas, indicating that they adjust 'how' they move in response to humans. They were found closer to bomas with increasing rainfall and decreasing moonlight. Overall, lion movements suggested an ability to partition their activities spatiotemporally with those of humans such that risk of human-caused mortality was minimized while use of a human-dominated landscape was maximized.

When animals change their activities in response to a perceived threat, their energetic input may decline. Marine ecotourism, including whale and dolphin watching, is growing globally and cetaceans perceive interactions with tour vessels as a form of risk. Observable behavioural changes need to be linked to bioenergetic effects to determine the potential population consequences of this disturbance. We developed a theoretical optimal dive model for bottlenose dolphins under three potential types of perceived risk resulting from human interactions at the surface (decreasing instantaneous risk, increasing instantaneous risk and no risk). We compared the predictions of these theoretical models to observed dive cycles of foraging male and female dolphins in the presence and absence of tour vessels. We used mixture models to classify dive types and mixed effects models to analyse changes in the interbreath interval of surface and bottom dives and the frequency of estimated bottom dives. Males significantly increased bottom time and performed fewer bottom dives when boats were present, matching predictions of our theoretical model for perceived decreasing instantaneous risk. In contrast, females significantly decreased bottom times and increased the frequency of bottom dives, matching predictions from the model for perceived increasing instantaneous risk. Therefore, our empirical results suggest differences in the perception of risk between sexes.Synthesis and applications. By comparing theoretical predictions with observed dive data, our study suggests that boat interactions during foraging can cause decreased net energy gain over a foraging bout for both sexes, with females being more impacted. The population under study is currently listed as critically endangered. Understanding whether these predicted energetic impacts affect an individual's vital rates will provide a link to the population-level consequences of this disturbance. Previous analytical approaches have failed to capture the costs associated with disturbance during foraging, leading to management recommendations that only protect animals from increased energetic expenditure. We suggest that the current management scheme should be revised to include foraging areas in order to secure the energy intake of animals.

When people search for resources together, individuals often find themselves in a producer-scrounger game, in which some individuals bear the cost of risk monitoring while others can free ride on those efforts. A theoretically rational strategy is to mix foraging and risk monitoring randomly with the same probability across all members, but such uncoordinated action often yields inefficiencies of under- or over-supply of risk monitoring in a group. Here, we examined whether people could spontaneously develop a coordinated risk-monitoring system, alternating vigilance and foraging in a pair. Given that human cooperation is vulnerable to fear of exploitation and emotional arousal under risk, we hypothesized that such sources of anxiety would be potential disruptors to coordination. In a laboratory experiment, two participants worked on a treasure hunt task simultaneously, in which they chose between low or high vigilance against predators during foraging without verbal communication. If one chose high vigilance with personal cost, it yielded a spillover benefit to the other. Besides behavioral choices, each participant's physiological arousal (skin conductance response) and cognitive effort (tonic pupil dilation) were measured during the task. Results showed that some pairs were actually able to develop a role-alternating system over time through tacit coordination, but coordinated action was also vulnerable to anxiety and mistrust among participants. Overall, these results imply that, besides the mutual behavioral control that often characterizes repeated interaction, cognitive control of emotional arousal may be a critical psychological factor for the emergence of coordinated cooperation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,40,5,,,,,427,435,,10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2019.05.004,,,,,,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Biomedical Social Sciences,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Among the factors affecting FID, tests of effects of group size (i.e., number of potential prey) on FID have yielded contrasting results. Group size or flock size could either affect FID negatively (i.e., the dilution effect caused by the presence of many individuals) or positively (i.e., increased vigilance due to more eyes scanning for predators). These effects may be associated with gregarious species, because such species should be better adapted to exploiting information from other individuals in the group than nongregarious species. Sociality may explain why earlier findings on group size versus FID have yielded different conclusions. Here, we analyzed how flock size affected bird FID in eight European countries. A phylogenetic generalized least square regression model was used to investigate changes in escape behavior of bird species in relation to number of individuals in the flock, starting distance, diet, latitude, and type of habitat. Flock size of different bird species influenced how species responded to perceived threats. We found that gregarious birds reacted to a potential predator earlier (longer FID) when aggregated in large flocks. These results support a higher vigilance arising from many eyes scanning in birds, suggesting that sociality may be a key factor in the evolution of antipredator behavior both in urban and rural areas. Finally, future studies comparing FID must pay explicit attention to the number of individuals in flocks of gregarious species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2019,9,10,,,,,6096,6104,,10.1002/ece3.5193,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, to date there have been relatively few studies designed to assess the effects of PNS on anxiety, stress and fear responses, or the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a system clearly linked to stress and fear-related responses as well as neuropsychiatric disorders). In the current study, rats exposed to variable PNS were evaluated for anxiety-related behaviors in open field, elevated plus maze, and light/dark preference tasks. Innate fear responses were assessed using a predatory odor task and learned fear and extinction were assessed with a contextual fear conditioning task. As an indicator of HPA axis function, serum corticosterone levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay at various time points. The results indicated that PNS resulted in several behavioral anomalies including decreased innate fear responses to predator odor, impaired fear extinction, increased locomotor activity and stereotypic-like behaviors. Baseline levels of corticosterone in PNS subjects were similar to non-stressed controls; however, when exposed to acute stress, they exhibited an increase in corticosterone that was greater in magnitude. PNS was not associated with increased anxiety-like behaviors or deficits in learning or retention during contextual fear conditioning. Collectivity, these data support the argument that variable PNS in rats is a valid model system for studying some behavioral components of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the influence of stress hormones.

Thus, the risk perception of predation shapes the cost-benefit decisions associated with food and safety in animal communities. Even non-consumptive human-related activities such as ecotourism may influence species behavioural traits. Marine wildlife tourism might produce different impacts on organisms, stressing and modifying (directly or indirectly) species behaviour, physiology and habitat use. Understand the effects of human presence on site-attached fish' behaviour is crucial to elucidate how dive-tourism could shape their limited-range seascape. Given the importance of the territorial damselfishes as reef farmers and 'ecosystems engineers', here we investigated if the presence of SCUBA divers and snorkelers can disrupt the foraging and territorial defence of the Dusky damselfish, Stegastes fuscus. Experimental approaches (diver presence and absence) were applied in 30 territories of S. fuscus using underwater remote video cameras. Behavioural responses were analysed by considering the frequency of refuge, foraging and chase behaviours. Both recreational dive activities had an analogous role in frighten and disturb the Dusky damselfish activities. Considering the frequency of behaviours displayed in diver's absence vs presence, S. fuscus increased its refuge times from approximately 2% to 50% on SCUBA diver presence and from 9% to 43% in snorkeler presence. It is directly linked to the missed feeding opportunities, which reduced by half during both diver's presence. Damselfish's aggressiveness proportionally dropped (0.3%) during SCUBA diver presence but increased (2.4%) while snorkeler was present. However, the average frequency of chase behaviour reduced with both divers' approach. Interruptions in damselfish behaviour may modify the resource monopolization and productivity inside their territories, affecting its relationships with other species beyond the boundaries of their territoriality, and leading a possible change on its functional role in the reef community. Territorial reef fish behaviour and their relationship with divers' presence can provide a more holistic comprehension regarding the seascape of fear concept and could be useful as an indicator of human disturbances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY-JUN,2019,514,,,,,,34,40,,10.1016/j.jembe.2019.03.009,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We experimentally tested whether Burrowing owls coming from rural and urban habitats showed differences in behavioural responses when facing humans and domestic dogs. We measured flight initiation distances (FIDs), nest returning, and aggressiveness level when owls faced a human and a human with a dog walking towards them. Our results showed that urban owls recognise a human with a dog as a greater threat than a human alone, thus indicating that fear of domestic animals should be considered as affecting owls' settlement in cities and towns. On the other hand, rural owls perceived human and dogs as similar threats, but showed higher FIDs, less aggressiveness, and lower tendency to return to the nest than urban owls in both treatments. These findings emphasize the importance of modified habitats in modelling the response of urban and rural owls to predators and represent another step in the explanation of how wild animals assess and respond to threats associated with living in urbanized environments.

Although optimality models predict the distance at which an animal should initiate vigilance and flight, many studies have shown that animals generally flee soon after detecting an approaching threat, supporting the 'flush early and avoid the risk' (FEAR) hypothesis. Despite this, flight behaviour varies markedly depending on context, suggesting some behavioural plasticity in the response of prey to a given threat. We evaluated the degree of plasticity in the flight responses of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, a highly flexible species which thrives in human-dominated landscapes. Based on individually identifiable animals and a standardized flight initiation protocol, we measured the distance at which a deer detected an approaching threat, and the distance at which it subsequently initiated flight. Our results provide strong support for the FEAR hypothesis, suggesting that alert and flight responses are strongly coupled in roe deer. However, the perceived level of both risk (in terms of landscape openness and proximity to human infrastructure) and reward (in terms of habitat quality) influenced the time it took for a deer to detect an approaching threat, and the subsequent time for which the threat was tolerated prior to flight. Overall, our findings indicate that although roe deer minimize monitoring costs when assessing risk by fleeing early, they also adjust their monitoring and flight responses to the local risk-resource trade-off.

Ungulate prey can use increased vigilance to reduce their risk of predation, but little is known of the combined and interactive risk effects from humans and wolves in determining ungulate behaviour across time and space. Understanding the interplay between these risk effects is increasingly important, considering the recolonisation of several large carnivores to more human-dominated landscapes in Europe. Aim. The aim of the present study was to assess the vigilance behaviour expressed by red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to both humans and wolves in the Polish Bialowiez. a Forest. Methods. Using a camera-trap transect, the effect of distance to human settlements, hunting season, patterns of space use by wolves (Canis lupus), canopy openness, canopy height, time of day, as well as sex/age of individuals, on the vigilance behaviour observed in red deer was studied using a model-selection approach. Key results. We did not find a clear effect of patterns of space use by wolves or distance to human settlements on red deer vigilance behaviour at the landscape scale. However, red deer showed increased vigilance during the hunting season and during the day outside of protected areas and reserves, because disturbance from human hunters is highest. Conversely, we also found that red deer were more vigilant at night within more protected areas, which is likely to be explained by the increased activity of wolves because human activity is strictly limited. Conclusions. Our study showed that vigilance behaviour of red deer in Bialowiez. a Primeval Forest is more driven by human hunting than by the frequency of wolf presence at a landscape scale. This could be explained by the higher temporal and spatial predictability of human hunting activities than wolf risk. We found that patterns of wolf space use, as opposed to the omnipresent fear effects from humans, had only localised effects by increasing vigilance levels during night hours in non-hunting areas of the forest. The reverse was observed outside of protected reserves. Understanding how prey species respond to this new combination of risk from natural predators and humans, is increasingly important in a landscape where human risk is becoming ever more potent and carnivores recolonise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,48,2,,,,,163,174,,10.1071/WR20059,,NOV 2020,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Recently, it has been suggested that hunting for fear might help maximize nonconsumptive effects of hunting and their cascading impacts. We investigated how a predator-free black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis Merriam, 1898) population introduced to the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada) responded to short-term hunting for fear. We conducted a hunt that minimized killing and maximized scaring on an island where some deer were marked. Between control and hunted sites, we compared deer use of bait stations and of shoreline areas (i.e., an open and risky area that provided marine subsidies). We also compared the browsing pressure and growth of two grasses and two shrubs. Hunting for fear had no effect on the overall use of bait stations and shorelines. However, in the area exposed to hunting, unmarked deer, which were assumed to be less tolerant of human disturbance, avoided bait stations at the outset of hunting. We concluded that individuals perceive and respond to risk differently. Furthermore, two of the four plant species were less likely to be browsed and had better growth in the experimental area than in the control area, suggesting an indirect effect of hunting on plants mediated by deer behaviour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2014,92,11,,,,,915,925,,10.1139/cjz-2014-0122,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

This diversity of threats is matched by a set of universal and species specific defensive behaviors which are often subsumed under the emotions of fear and anxiety. A major issue in the field of affective science, however, is that these emotions are often conflated and scientists fail to reflect the ecological conditions that gave rise to them. I attempt to clarify these semantic issues by describing the link between ethologically defined defensive strategies and fear.

Occurrence of hyena estimated by faecal transects decreased close to human settlements substantiating the occurrence of a zone with lower risk of hyena predation. The diurnal pattern in the average distance between mountain nyala relocations and human settlements was consistent with the human shield hypothesis with significantly shorter distances during night (when exposed to predation) than during day. However, mountain nyala showed large individual heterogeneity in use of human shields. While nearly all individuals occasionally moved out of the park to human settlements during night, the frequency of such excursions varied from 0% to 71%. The excursions occurred year-round and were not driven by seasonal access to crops. We have previously demonstrated a strong negative effect of humans on the large-scale distribution pattern of mountain nyala.

But fossorial species cannot stay safely underground forever, and they must also risk emerging overground, to forage and find mates. To make this trade-off effectively and maximize their own fitness, it is imperative they assess how predation risk varies in space and time, and adapt their denning behaviour accordingly. We used European badger (Meles meles) burrows (setts) in Bialowie(z) over dota Forest, Poland as a model for investigating how the denning behaviour of a fossorial mesocarnivore varies across gradients of landscape scale perceived risk imposed by wolves (Canis lupus) and humans, defined as wolf space use and distance to settlements, respectively. We monitored seventeen setts with varying levels of perceived human and wolf risk with camera traps for two months to study three denning behaviours: frequency of badger sett use, frequency of badger sett sharing with other mesocarnivore species and badger emergence time. Frequency of sett use varied relative to perceived wolf but not human risk. Setts in the highest risk areas were used ca. 60% less often than those in the lowest perceived risk areas, and setts with juveniles were only present in areas of lower perceived risk. Food availability, quantified as earthworm abundance in an area of 2.1 km(2)around setts, did not affect the frequency setts were used. Emergence time and frequency of sett sharing with other mesocarnivores, which have been proposed to be anti-predator strategies, did not vary with either perceived risk factor.

Predator odor 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT) and its potent analog 2-methyl-2-thiazoline (2MT) are believed to activate specific odorant receptors to elicit innate fear/defensive behaviors in naive mice. Here, we conduct a large-scale recessive genetics screen of ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized mice. We find that loss of Trpal, a pungency/irritancy receptor, diminishes TMT/2MT and snake skin-evoked innate fear/defensive responses. Accordingly, Trpal(-/-) mice fail to effectively activate known fear/stress brain centers upon 2MT exposure, despite their apparent ability to smell and learn to fear 2MT. Moreover, Trpal acts as a chemosensor for 2MT/TMT and Trpal-expressing trigeminal ganglion neurons contribute critically to 2MT-evoked freezing.

Fishing pressure was positively associated with higher FID, but only in families that were primarily targeted by spear guns. Among these families, there were variable responses in FID; some families showed increased FID monotonically with fishing pressure, while others showed increased FID only at the highest levels of fishing pressure.

Risks of predation or interference competition are major factors shaping the distribution of species. An animal's response to risk can either be reactive, to an immediate risk, or predictive, based on preceding risk or past experiences. The manner in which animals respond to risk is key in understanding avoidance, and hence coexistence, between interacting species. 2. We investigated whether cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), known to be affected by predation and competition by lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), respond reactively or predictively to the risks posed by these larger carnivores. 3. We used simultaneous spatial data from Global Positioning System (GPS) radiocollars deployed on all known social groups of cheetahs, lions and spotted hyaenas within a 2700 km(2) study area on the periphery of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. The response to risk of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas was explored on three levels: short-term or immediate risk, calculated as the distance to the nearest (contemporaneous) lion or spotted hyaena, long-term risk, calculated as the likelihood of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas based on their cumulative distributions over a 6-month period and habitat-associated risk, quantified by the habitat used by each of the three species. 4. We showed that space and habitat use by cheetahs was similar to that of lions and, to a lesser extent, spotted hyaenas. However, cheetahs avoided immediate risks by positioning themselves further from lions and spotted hyaenas than predicted by a random distribution. 5.

For example, wildlife may be more vigilant near human disturbance, resulting in decreased forage intake and reduced reproductive success. We measured the effects of human activities compared to predator and other environmental factors on the behaviour of elk (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus 1758) in a human-dominated landscape in Alberta, Canada. Methodology/Principal Findings: We collected year-round behavioural data of elk across a range of human disturbances. We estimated linear mixed models of elk behaviour and found that human factors (land-use type, traffic and distance from roads) and elk herd size accounted for more than 80% of variability in elk vigilance. Elk decreased their feeding time when closer to roads, and road traffic volumes of at least 1 vehicle every 2 hours induced elk to switch into a more vigilant behavioural mode with a subsequent loss in feeding time. Other environmental factors, thought crucial in shaping vigilance behaviour in elk (natural predators, reproductive status of females), were not important. The highest levels of vigilance were recorded on public lands where hunting and motorized recreational activities were cumulative compared to the national park during summer, which had the lowest levels of vigilance. Conclusions/Significance: In a human-dominated landscape, effects of human disturbance on elk behaviour exceed those of habitat and natural predators. Humans trigger increased vigilance and decreased foraging in elk. However, it is not just the number of people but also the type of human activity that influences elk behaviour (e.g. hiking vs. hunting). Quantifying the actual fitness costs of human disturbance remains a challenge in field studies but should be a primary focus for future researches. Some species are much more likely to be disturbed by humans than by non-human predators: for these species, quantifying human disturbance may be the highest priority for conservation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 28,2012,7,11,,,,,,,e50611,10.1371/journal.pone.0050611,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We used a giving-up density framework using the proportional consumption of hay provided by humans to measure the perceptions of risk in European bison. European bison resource selection was primarily driven by minimising the distance they travel over open ground in early winter (i.e. avoiding humans), however by the end of winter, when resources are scarce, bison selected haystacks for their nutrient quality (low fibre, high Mg and energy). This study illustrates how resource selection varies according to the condition of animals (i.e. state-dependency affects the marginal value theorem). It also indicates conservation managers using hay quality may actively manage human-bison conflicts in trouble spots and that bison are currently free from top-down limitation in BiaowieA1/4a as they do not perceive wolves as threatening enough to alter their foraging behaviour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2015,30,10,,,,,2079,2093,,10.1007/s10980-015-0232-2,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Increasing visitation, however, can compromise ecological integrity.

Species that redistribute themselves closer to people is of growing management concern both in and out of national parks because of 1) human safety, 2) animal health, and 3) ecological consequences. Drivers of distributional change are often dissimilar but may include increased association with people for predator avoidance - the human shield hypothesis. We examine redistribution patterns with comparative, observational, and experimental approaches contrasting ecological responses of an iconic species in an USA national park - Glacier. Specifically, we focused on the role of predator-avoidance and resource enhancement to test whether a cold-adapted alpine obligate, mountain goats, (Oreamnos americanus), mediate their distribution by increasing spatial overlap with humans. Individuals that enhanced mineral acquisition through access to human urine concomitantly reduced behavioral and ecological responses to grizzly bear (Ursus arctos hornbilis) experiments. Goats near people also displayed reduced group sizes, vigilance, use of escape terrain, and forfeited migrations to naturally occurring minerals. Our findings re-enforce the increasing complexities of natural area management because visitation is altering ecological interactions.

While our basic knowledge of social systems has grown substantially, it has rarely been applied to human issues. Here, we attempted to bridge the gap between animal behaviour theory and human psychology by conducting social experiments involving fish. As in many species, minnows (family: Cyprinidae) repeatedly exposed to risky situations can develop a behavioural phenotype characterized by neophobic tendencies, pacing and stereotypic behaviours. Here, we tested whether the simple presence of calm (or un-calm) conspecific models could lead to a weakening of the high-risk phenotype in minnows that acquired fear either in isolation or within a group. We first documented that the social context of risk exposure impacted the intensity of the high-risk phenotype, with minnows exposed to risk in isolation showing stronger high-risk traits compared to those that were exposed to risk in groups. However, individuals exposed to risk in isolation were more influenced by calm models, despite their more pronounced phenotype. We argue that group exposure led to social reinforcement of risk, which in turn decreased the information transfer about safety in these individuals. We also demonstrate that a group of calm models, and not un-calm models, was required to weaken the high-risk phenotype. These findings highlight the interplay between social reinforcement of risk and safety in social groups and the impact of groups on information transmission. Moreover, our results parallel anecdotal reports of successes or failures of social therapies for post-traumatic stress (PTS) patients based on the social context of symptom acquisition, suggesting that understanding the transfer of information in social animals could prove fruitful in understanding and modelling PTS recovery.

Conflict between people and large carnivores is an urgent conservation issue world-wide. Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of livestock depredation by large carnivores is greatly needed. 2. We studied the spatial, foraging and behavioural ecology of African lions Panthera leo in the Botswana Makgadikgadi ecosystem. This ecosystem comprises a protected area, characterized by high seasonal fluctuation in wild prey abundance, and adjacent lands, which are used for livestock grazing and characterized by stable livestock abundance, but also a risk of anthropogenic mortality. 3. Makgadikgadi lions preferentially preyed upon migratory wild herbivores when they were present; however, data from GPS (Global Positioning System) radiocollared lions revealed that the majority of the study lions did not follow the migratory herds but remained resident at one or other border of the park and switched to livestock (abundant and readily available), and to a lesser extent resident wild herbivores (relatively scarce), in periods of migratory wild herbivore scarcity. 4. Resident lions' use of space differed between periods of wild prey abundance and scarcity. These changes were likely to increase the frequency of encounter with their primary prey in periods of primary prey abundance and with livestock in periods of primary prey scarcity. 5. The risk of conflict with humans was a major driver of lion ecology in the human-dominated landscape surrounding the protected area. Resident lions generally avoided the close vicinity of cattle-posts. When they used such areas, they avoided temporal overlap with periods that humans were most active and travelled at high speed reducing the time spent in these areas. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study suggests that lions balance the benefits of accessing livestock with the costs associated with livestock raiding. Hence, reduction in livestock availability through effective livestock husbandry in periods of wild prey scarcity should lead to reduced conflict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2012,49,1,,,,,73,81,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02099.x,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Interference interactions, harassment and injury from larger carnivores may still pose a risk to smaller mesopredators. Foraging theory suggests that animals should adjust their behaviour accordingly to optimise foraging efficiency and overall fitness, trading off harvest rate with costs to fitness. The foraging behaviour of red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, was studied with automated cameras and a repeated measures giving-up density (GUD) experiment where olfactory risk cues were manipulated. In Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia, red foxes increased GUDs by 34% and quitting harvest rates by 29% in response to wolf urine. In addition to leaving more food behind, foxes also responded to wolf urine by spending less time visiting food patches each day and altering their behaviour in order to compensate for the increased risk when foraging from patches. Thus, red foxes utilised olfaction to assess risk and experienced foraging costs due to the presence of a cue from gray wolves, Canis lupus. This study identifies behavioural mechanisms which may enable competing predators to coexist, and highlights the potential for additional ecosystem service pathways arising from the behaviour of large carnivores. Given the vulnerability of large carnivores to anthropogenic disturbance, a growing human population and intensifying resource consumption, it becomes increasingly important to understand ecological processes so that land can be managed appropriately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018,187,3,,,,,573,583,,10.1007/s00442-018-4133-3,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

These factors vary locally and there has been no attempt so far at defining those that ubiquitously impact wolf behaviour. I compared 11 studies (from Alaska to Israel) to assess the influence of (1) public road density, (2) human population density, (3) human-caused mortality, (4) proportion of domestic animals in wolf diet, (5) proportion of forest, (6) latitude and (7) mean annual temperature on nocturnal wolf activity and movements. Nocturnal activity was mainly correlated to the proportion of domestic animals in the diet and the density of public roads, whereas nocturnal movements were mainly correlated to latitude. The importance of latitude indicates that sun periodicity might represent an important signal (`Zeitgeber') for circadian rhythms in wolves. Environmental constraints such as high temperatures during the day and a higher hunting success in crepuscular periods probably limit the ability of wolves to avoid humans by nocturnal behaviour. I therefore suggest that in regions where wolves hunt wild prey, they experience a trade-off between predation risk by humans and increased hunting success during twilight hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2009,115,7,,,,,649,657,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01653.x,,,,,,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

These relationships are exemplified by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in mixed hardwood forest communities of the northeastern U.S.A., whose foraging behaviour can influence the population ecology of several prey items and the disease ecology of human Lyme disease and its tick vector. We examined whether dosage of an immunogen influenced foraging behaviour in wild white-footed mice at foraging arenas. Low-dose mice preferentially favoured safe (covered) food patches over risky food patches, whereas high-dose mice showed no preference based on patch safety. Immunochallenge did not alter foraging time in patches of equal risk. The results reveal fitness costs of an immune response, namely that immunochallenged mice favour increased energy consumption over safety from predation, presumably leading to greater mortality. Acceptance of risky patches for foraging by immunochallenged mice suggests that mice mounting this immune response will forage in a greater proportion of their home ranges and encounter a greater number of patchily distributed prey items and ticks carrying pathogens.

This conflict has prompted the development of non-lethal deterrents, a management technique that uses aversive stimuli to elicit avoidance. Animals are expected to be sensitive to cues of danger to avoid sources of mortality. Deterrents capitalize on behavioral mechanisms such as threat detection, assessment and learning. A deterrent must create enough risk, or cost, that it overcomes the heightened foraging benefits of depredation. Theoretically, effective deterrence relies on altering the relative costs and benefits to the individual depredator by creating a perceived risk associated with human resources. Here we discuss the underlying behavioral basis of how deterrents generate avoidance. We review deterrents applied to marine mammals to mitigate conflict with fisheries and suggest that fear conditioning could be useful in this context. This is discussed in the context of some potential management concerns of application of non-lethal deterrents in the wild. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Escape behaviour has evolved to allow an individual to escape once captured by a predator. We tested whether altered predation risk in urban environments is associated with colonization of such habitats by comparing escape behaviour of 1132 individual birds belonging to 15 species from nearby rural and urban populations when captured by a human. Raptors (of which the Eurasian sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was one of the most common species) were more common in rural than in urban habitats, whereas cats, Felis catus, showed the opposite pattern. There were consistent differences in escape behaviour between habitats, showing divergence in behaviour from the ancestral rural state. Urban birds wriggled less, showed higher tonic immobility, more often lost feathers, were less aggressive by biting less often, and emitted fear screams and alarm calls more often than rural birds. Furthermore, differences in escape behaviour between habitats were related to susceptibility to predation by sparrowhawks, as expected if differences in behaviour were due to differences in predation risk. Finally, an analysis of differences in escape behaviour between rural and urban birds revealed a significant relationship with time since urbanization, suggesting that escape behaviour has changed in urban environments over time. These findings suggest that release from predation and change in predator community associated with urbanization has altered the antipredator behaviour of birds colonizing towns and cities.

Hyraxes migrate from refuge to refuge, presumably following forage availability, but their migration patterns are strongly affected by the availability and spacing of the rock piles that form their den sites and give them protection from predators. We therefore expect changes in predation risk to influence the ability of hyrax groups to migrate from site to site. We combine mathematical metapopulation models of hyrax behavioral ecology, as well as compartmental models of disease dynamics, to investigate the effect of microhabitat alteration and varying perceived predation risk on disease incidence. Our models indicate that such fine-scale alterations in predation risk can have surprising effects on pathogen prevalence, leading to the emergence of epizootic cycles. Regular (predictable) cycles and chaotic (unpredictable) cycles may occur as predation risk is reduced. Under some conditions, cycles may result from very small changes in predation risk or environmental conditions.

Here, we test whether prey compensate for reduced visual information by increasing their antipredator responses to chemically mediated risk cues in turbid conditions. Experiments with the spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, found that baseline activity levels were reduced by 23 per cent in high turbidity conditions relative to low turbidity conditions. Furthermore, risk cues elicited strong antipredator responses at all turbidity levels; the strongest antipredator responses were observed in high turbidity conditions, with fish reducing their foraging by almost 40 per cent, as compared with 17 per cent for fish in clear conditions.

However, our understanding of the relationship between hunting time schedule and risk-effect level remains limited. We investigated the relationships between hunting time schedule (the duration of the hunting operation and its execution interval) and the extent of sika deer (Cervus nippon) spatial displacement from hunting sites in hunting with and without driving (drive and stalk hunting, respectively) in the Tanzawa Mountains, Japan, 2016-2018. Driving in deer hunting means the action of making deer move by using dogs and/or hunters. We considered the probability of photographing deer with a camera trap after hunting operation per day (hazard) as an indicator of the extent of deer spatial displacement. Hazard was negatively associated with the duration of hunting operation in both drive and stalk hunting. In stalk hunting, hazard was also negatively associated with the number of days elapsed since the previous hunting operation in the same hunting site, whereas such an association was not observed in drive hunting. For drive hunting, in order to divert deer from hunting sites for a long time, hunting operations should be conducted throughout the day even if these operations are expected to end in a poor harvest. Conversely, for stalk hunting, short hunting-operation time and short execution interval days between each operation are required to reduce deer spatial displacement.

Flexibility in large carnivore behavior may be a primary factor mediating coexistence with people, allowing carnivores to calibrate their activity and habitat use to the perceived level of human risk. However, our understanding of how large carnivores adjust the timing and location of behaviors in response to variations in human activity across the landscape remains limited, impacting our ability to identify important habitat for populations outside of protected areas. Here we examine whether African lions (Panthera leo) modify their behavior and habitat use in response to risk of a human encounter, and whether behavior-specific habitat selection allows lions to access feeding opportunities in a human-dominated landscape in Kenya. We determined fine-scale behavioral states for lions using high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data, and then investigated behavior-specific habitat selection at multiple temporal and spatial scales (ranging from 15 minutes to 12 hours and from approximately 200 meters to several kilometers). We found that lions exhibit substantial differences in habitat selection with respect to humans based on behavioral state and time of day. During the day, when risk of human encounter is highest, lions avoided areas of high human use when resting, meandering, and feeding. However, lions specifically selected for habitat near people when feeding at night. Flexible habitat use by lions thus permits access to prey, which appear to concentrate in areas near humans. The importance of habitat near people for feeding was only apparent when analyses explicitly accounted for lion behavioral state and spatiotemporal scale, highlighting the necessity of incorporating such information when investigating human impacts on large carnivore habitat use. Our results support the contention that behavior-specific habitat selection promotes carnivore persistence in human-dominated landscapes, demonstrating the importance of considering not just whether but how large carnivores use habitat near humans when managing vulnerable populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,100,4,,,,,,,e02644,10.1002/ecy.2644,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

A better understanding of the factors triggering such attacks is critical to mitigating the risk of future encounters in landscapes where humans and large carnivores coexist. Since 1955, of the 632 attacks on humans by large carnivores, 106 (17%) involved predation. We draw on concepts and empirical evidence from the Predator-Prey Interaction Theory to provide insights into how to reduce predatory attacks and, thus, improve human-large carnivore coexistence. Because large carnivore-caused mortality risks for humans are comparable to those shown by other mammal species in response to predation risk, framing predatory attacks under a theory underpinning predator-prey interactions may represent a powerful tool for minimizing large carnivore attacks. Most large carnivores have marked crepuscular and nocturnal activity; by minimizing outdoor activities in high-risk areas from sunset to sunrise, humans could reduce the number of predatory attacks. The most effective way in which prey avoid predation, but still utilize risky areas, is by adopting temporal changes in activity patterns. The human age groups most often targeted by large carnivores are essentially the same as when predators in general search for prey, namely the youngest individuals. Thus, increased parental vigilance and education for children may be a key factor to reduce predatory attacks. Lastly, because group size can affect predator-prey encounter rates and outcomes in different ways, large groups of people can decrease predation rates. Many humans may no longer consider predation by large carnivores to be a logical or plausible consequence of our predator-naive behavior because humans now only occasionally represent prey for such species. However, the solution to the conflicts represented by large carnivore attacks on humans requires the implementation of correct strategies to face these rare events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FAL,2017,11,2,,,,,192,207,,,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Adaptation to predation risk is important in an evolutionary sense: caution could be beneficial for reducing the risk of injury and mortality; on the other hand, reacting too soon and too often can cause stress, costs energy and may lower survival. This study compares the extent of tolerance to human disturbance in two introduced but established waterfowl species, Greylag Geese Anser anser (Anserinae) and Egyptian Geese Alopochen aegyptiaca (Tadorninae). After their recent colonisation of the city of Stuttgart in southwest Germany, Greylag Geese first hatched a brood in 1995, while Egyptian Geese only latterly colonised the city (first successfully fledged brood in 2010), but subsequently showed exponential population increase. There are many potential reasons for this; they may have a broader ecological niche (i.e. are able to use a wider array of available nesting sites), and have larger broods with higher fledging rates, but Egyptian Geese may also show higher tolerance towards disturbance than Greylag Geese in an urban setting. We investigated the last of these hypotheses by comparing variation between the two species in their reaction to disturbance stimuli between 5 June and 22 August 2018. Our behavioural observations showed that Egyptian Geese reacted to disturbance stimuli > 50% more frequently than Greylag Geese, and with more intense behaviours. In addition to species-specific differences, we found that reaction to disturbance also varied with location, the type of disturbance, social status, time of day and ambient temperature. Both species reacted most strongly (i.e. were alerted or displaced at greater distances) when disturbed by dogs. Egyptian Geese were generally more cautious than Greylag Geese to equivalent stimuli from human presence. Such cautiousness may, in addition to ecological differences, partly explain the greater success of Egyptian Geese as an invading species in novel environments. Alternatively, this difference between the two species may reflect a longer habituation period, or perhaps genetic adaptation to disturbance stimuli by Greylag Geese.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,71,,,,,,244,261,,,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Fragmentation is likely to lead to changes in predation risk, which may cause behavioral responses with possible population level consequences. It has recently been shown that the awareness of predator presence, resulting in a fear response, strongly affects behavior and physiology of the prey individuals. Costs arising from fear may be as important for the prey population size as the direct killing of prey. We tested how predation risk in the form of scent of a specialist predator, the least weasel (Mustela nivalis nivalis), affects bank vole (Myodes glareolus) behavior in fragmented enclosures consisting of either non-fragmented (one patch) or fragmented (four patches) habitats of the same total area. Vole movement areas tended to be larger in the non-fragmented habitat. Fear decreased vole activity and tended to increase the use of the open matrix area. No interactions between fragmentation and fear treatments or differences in breeding related behaviors or fitness were found in our short-term experiment. However, behavioral mechanisms such as decreased activity and change of movements to the risky matrix could cause negative effects and population decline in the long run. Fragmentation is a serious issue in all human exploited habitats causing animals to face more risks compared to more uniform and sheltering environments. This should be especially taken into account in conservation of habitat and the reintroduction of captive reared animals where both intact sheltering habitats and food providing have habitats become rarer.

Recently the concept of the ecology of fear has been defined and formalised; yet there has been relatively little focus on how these ideas apply to large carnivore species which, although not prey sensu stricto, also experience fear as a result of threats from humans. Large carnivores are likely also subject to a Landscape of Fear similar to that described for prey species. We argue that although fear is generic, 'human-caused mortality' represents a distinct and very important cause of fear for large carnivores, particularly terrestrial large carnivores as their activities overlap with those of humans to a greater degree. We introduce the idea of a 'Landscape of Coexistence' for large carnivores to denote a subset of the Landscape of Fear where sufficient areas of low human-caused mortality risk are present in the landscape for long term coexistence of large carnivores and humans. We then explore aspects of terrestrial large carnivore behavioural ecology that may be best explained by risk of human-caused mortality, and how the nature of a Landscape of Coexistence for these large carnivores is likely to be shaped by specific factors such as habitat structure, wild and domestic prey base, and human distribution and behaviour. The human characteristics of this Landscape of Coexistence may be as important in determining large carnivore distribution and behavioural ecology as the distribution of resources. Understanding the Landscape of Coexistence for terrestrial large carnivores is therefore important for their biology and conservation throughout large parts of their remaining ranges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2015,124,10,,,,,1263,1273,,10.1111/oik.02224,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect.

In zebra and giraffe, flight responses to humans were significantly more likely when closer to settlements; however, there was a weak relationship between flight responses and distance to settlement in all other species.

Resume Alors que les populations humaines croissent et entrent de plus en plus en contact avec la faune sauvage, il est important de bien comprendre comment les perturbations des hommes modifient le comportement de la faune. Par des analyses a echelle spatiale fine, nous avons etudie comment la proximite d'installations humaines affecte les reponses des ongules contre les predateurs. Nous avons etudie sept especes communes d'ongules, le dik-dik de Kirk, la gazelle de Thompson, l'impala, le phacochere commun, le gnou commun, le zebre commun et la girafe masai dans l'Ecosysteme Tarangire-Manyara au nord de la Tanzanie. Chez le zebre et la girafe, les reponses de fuite loin des hommes etaient significativement plus probables lorsqu'ils etaient plus proches des installations humaines, mais il n'y avait qu'une faible relation entre les reponses de fuite et la distance par rapport aux installations chez les autres especes. Meme s'il y avait en general peu de relation avec la proximite des installations humaines, la distribution de ces installations dans le paysage semble affecter le comportement de la faune, ce qui suggere que les animaux percoivent et repondent a la variation spatiale des risques representes par les hommes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018,56,3,,,,,528,536,,10.1111/aje.12489,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

In non-human species females and, or their cues can also increase male risk taking. Under the ecologically relevant condition of predation threat, brief exposure of male mice to the odors of a sexually receptive novel female reduces the avoidance of, and aversive responses to, a predator. We briefly review evidence showing that estrogen receptors (ERs), ER alpha and ER beta, are associated with the mediation of these risk taking responses. We show that ERs influence the production of the female odors that affect male risk taking, with the odors of wild type (ER alpha WT, ER beta WT), oxytocin (OT) wildtype (OTWT), gene-deleted 'knock-out' ER ER beta (ER beta KO), but not ER beta KO or oxytocin (OT) OTKO or ovariectomized (OVX) female mice reducing the avoidance responses of male mice to cat odor. We further show that administration of specific ER alpha and ER beta agonists to OVX females results in their odors increasing male risk taking and boldness towards a predator. We also review evidence that ERs are involved in the mediation of the responses of males to female cues, with ER alpha being associated with the sexual and both ER beta and ER alpha with the sexual and social mechanisms underlying the effects of female cues on male risk taking.

While numerous studies have examined predation risk and risk effects in recent decades, a lack of standardization in approaches has impeded progress in the field. We provide an overview of five major study design considerations involved in assessing predation risk and responses of prey in carnivore-ungulate systems, highlighting how different design choices can impact the strength and scope of inference. First, we stress the importance of distinguishing measures of predation risk (probability of being killed) from measures of risk effects (costs of antipredator behaviors in response to risk). Second, we recommend explicit consideration of spatial and temporal scales using a standardized framework to facilitate cross-study comparisons. Third, ungulates use visual, auditory, and olfactory sensory pathways to evaluate predation risk. Experiments that manipulate signals of risk (e.g., auditory playbacks or application of predator scent) can be powerful approaches, but the dosages and types of cues need to be carefully considered. Fourth, ungulates usually face threats from multiple predators simultaneously, and we highlight the potential for remote cameras and structural equation modeling to help address this challenge. Fifth, emerging technologies may substantially improve our ability to assess risk. We discuss several promising technologies, such as animal-borne video, unmanned aerial vehicles, and physiological sensors. We conclude with general recommendations for study design, which may improve the utility of predation risk research for the conservation and management of carnivore-ungulate systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,232,,,,,,194,207,,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.02.011,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Although some species may habituate to human presence, other species do not show any signs of habituation, and may even be sensitized or affected by human disturbance. Furthermore, anthropogenic effects on bird behaviour rarely have been explored to address the alteration of frequencies of aggressive and fear-associated behaviours. Such behavioural approaches may provide substantial data for bird conservation and management. Therefore, we assessed whether human disturbance disrupts the normal behaviour of Burrowing Owls Athene cunicularia. Specifically, we assessed whether guarding parents exhibited aggressive and fearful behaviours differentially in areas where human contact was more common. Burrowing Owls showed increased frequencies of threat displays in sites with more people walking by the nests, but not fear behaviours.

We combined four camera trap datasets from Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park to evaluate the effects of roads and settlement on diel activity patterns of elephants (Loxodonta africana). We found high rates of elephant activity along the boundary of the park, where elephants can access cultivated crops, and along roads, which serve as movement corridors. However, elephants restricted their activity to the night and crepuscular periods in these areas of human disturbance, seeking refuge in the interior of the park away from roads and settlements during the day. Our findings suggest that a history of killing and antagonism has instilled a fear of humans in this elephant population, with implications for research, tourism and human-elephant coexistence.

Hunting pressure increases the perception of predation risk in ungulates and hares and may force them to create clumped groups within protected areas. Acute effects are showed immediately after harassments and may include displacement of home ranges, alteration of activity rhythms and increased hormone secretions. No study has been carried out yet on behavioural alterations induced by hunting on non-target, legally protected species, whereas these studies should be required to design addressed management and conservation plans. The crested porcupine Hystrix cristata represents a suitable model species to study effects of hunting on protected species, as its ranging movements and activity rhythms are seasonally, stereotypically repeated. My results on individually marked porcupines showed that, when hunting with dogs occurred, a displacement of home range arises towards areas providing easily accessible food resources (i.e. fruits, which do not require digging). This behaviour might prevent porcupines to spend a high amount of time digging bulbs and tubers and, thus, it may result in a reduction of activity bouts. Home range displacement has also been observed only when > 10 cm of snow are present on the ground. The presence of hunting dogs increases the predation risk perception by potential prey species, which in turn respond by altering their spatio-temporal behaviour. Wildlife managers should therefore evaluate the use of a small number of specialized dogs for hunting in management and conservation plans, particularly in areas characterized by the presence of endangered and protected species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2017,62,3,,,,,251,258,,10.1007/s13364-017-0313-5,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

In trials with only a human observer as the stimulus, urban squirrels exhibited reduced vigilance and anti-predator behavior compared to those in less urban areas. Next, we exposed squirrels in multiple urban and less urban sites to acoustic playbacks of a control stimulus (non-predatory bird calls), a natural predator (hawk), and dogs and recorded their vigilance and three different anti-predator behaviors when a human approached them while either broadcasting one of these three playbacks or no playbacks at all. Squirrels at urban sites also did not differ in their behavioral responses to the playbacks from possible predators (hawks or dogs) when they were compared to those at less urban sites exposed to these playbacks. Urban squirrels also exhibited increased vigilance and anti-predator behavior when exposed to a human paired with hawk playbacks compared to the control playbacks.

In Europe, the recolonization of large carnivores often occurs in areas where humans have greatly modified the landscape through forestry or agriculture. Currently, we poorly understand the effects of recolonizing large carnivores on extant prey species in anthropogenic landscapes. Here, we investigated if ungulate prey species showed innate responses to the scent of a regionally exterminated but native large carnivore, and whether the responses were affected by human-induced habitat openness. We experimentally introduced brown bear Ursus arctos scent to artificial feeding sites and used camera traps to document the responses of three sympatric ungulate species. In addition to controls without scent, reindeer scent Rangifer tarandus was used as a noncarnivore, novel control scent. Fallow deer Dama dama strongly avoided areas with bear scent. In the presence of bear scent, all ungulate species generally used open sites more than closed sites, whereas the opposite was observed at sites with reindeer scent or without scent. The opening of forest habitat by human practices, such as forestry and agriculture, creates a larger gradient in habitat openness than available in relatively unaffected closed forest systems, which may create opportunities for prey to alter their habitat selection and reduce predation risk in human-modified systems that do not exist in more natural forest systems. Increased knowledge about antipredator responses in areas subjected to anthropogenic change is important because these responses may affect prey population dynamics, lower trophic levels, and attitudes toward large carnivores.

We show that unsignaled nocturnal footshock caused rats living in an ethological apparatus to switch their natural foraging behavior from the dark to the light phase and that this switch was maintained as a free-running circadian rhythm upon removal of light cues and footshocks. Furthermore, this fear-entrained circadian behavior was dependent on an intact amygdala and suprachiasmatic nucleus.

For example, the predator's head and gaze orientation (direction of attention) may reveal its intentions, and faster-approaching predators are likely to represent greater risk. We examined the reactions of hadeda ibises Bostrychia hagedash. These large birds demonstrate a wide repertoire of responses to being approached (e. g. continuing to forage, slow walking, rapid escape walking, flight and alarm calling). Birds were approached tangentially 112 times by a human who either had the head and eyes directed towards (65 approaches) or directed away from (47 approaches) the birds to test the hypothesis that the direction of the observer's attention informs alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) in these birds. Direction of attention had a significant effect on AD and FID as well as the likelihood of taking flight and alarm calling by hadedas, with birds appearing to associate attention directed towards them as an indication of increased risk. Hadedas were able to differentiate between the direction of attention of an approaching human, whether or not there were multiple other humans in the near vicinity. We also examined whether the observer's approach speed altered the birds' responses. Approach speed affected the birds' FID, suggesting that they perceive greater danger in a faster-approaching intruder compared with a slower-walking one. These results support the predictions of optimal escape theory and emphasize the high resolution of antipredatory awareness in these birds. The marked success of hadeda ibises in urban environments may be due to their ability to become habituated to human presence and to modify their antipredator behaviour in response to subtle cues. These may be common traits of bird species that successfully adapt to urban environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2011,285,4,,,,,316,323,,10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00846.x,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

It has been reported that predator odor and calls can drive away rodents, but little is known about species-specific responses of prey. For these reasons, we compared the behavioral changes of common rodent species inhabiting the Chilean temperate forest (Abrothrix spp., the long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and the black rat Rattus rattus) when exposed to two different native predator calls (the austral pygmy owl Glaucidium nana and the rufous-legged owl Strix rufipes) and a control (no predator calls). Our results showed that all rodent species modified their behavior in the presence of predator calls, but the effects were species dependent. These findings point to the need to carefully study target rodent species instead of applying a general control plan for all rodent species. Ecologically based rodent management strategies are arising as a sustainable approach to rodent control, allowing us to preserve biodiversity while safeguarding human economic activities. Despite predator signals being known to generally repel rodents, few field-based studies have compared the behavioral effects of several predators on different prey species, especially in Neotropical ecosystems. Here, we used camera traps to study the behavior of rodent species native to the Chilean temperate forest (Abrothrix spp., long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and an introduced rodent (black rat Rattus rattus). Using playbacks of raptor calls, we experimentally exposed rodents to three predation risk treatments: austral pygmy owl calls (Glaucidium nana), rufous-legged owl calls (Strix rufipes) and a control treatment (absence of owl calls). We evaluated the effects of the treatments on the time allocated to three behaviors: feeding time, locomotor activity and vigilance. Moonlight and vegetation cover were also considered in the analyses, as they can modify perceived predation risk. Results showed that predator calls and environmental factors modified prey behavior depending not only on the predator species, but also on the rodent species. Consequently, owl playbacks could be regarded as a promising rodent control tool, knowing that future studies would be critical to deeply understand differences between species in order to select the most effective predator cues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,11,2,,,,,,,428,10.3390/ani11020428,,,,,,Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We measured the distance at which individual birds fled (flight initiation distance, FID, which represents a reliable and previously validated surrogate measure of response to predation risk) following a standardized protocol in nine pairs of rural and urban sites along a ca. 3000 km gradient from Southern Spain to Northern Finland during the breeding seasons 2009-2010. Raptor abundance was estimated by means of standard point counts at the same sites where FID information was recorded. Data on body mass and phylogenetic relationships among bird species sampled were extracted from the literature. An analysis of 12,495 flight distances of 714 populations of 159 species showed that mean FID decreased with increasing latitude after accounting for body size and phylogenetic effects. This decrease was paralleled by a similar cline in an index of the abundance of raptors. Urban populations had consistently shorter FIDs, supporting previous findings. The difference between rural and urban habitats decreased with increasing latitude, also paralleling raptor abundance trends. Overall, the latitudinal gradient in bird fear was explained by raptor abundance gradients, with additional small effects of latitude and intermediate effects of habitat. This study provides the first empirical documentation of a latitudinal trend in anti-predator behavior, which correlated positively with a similar trend in the abundance of predators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 28,2013,8,5,,,,,,,e64634,10.1371/journal.pone.0064634,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We assessed the response of eight species (African elephant, Maasai giraffe, plains zebra, common wildebeest, Grant's gazelle, impala, Thomson's gazelle and Kirk's dik dik) towards human observers in a landscape with variable anthropogenic hunting pressure. Using logistic regressions, we tested the effect of habitat type, group size, distance to observer and conservation status of the area on the likelihood of animal behavioural adjustments (walking away, fleeing or giving alarm calls). Habitat type did not affect the likelihood of a response towards humans. Dik diks were less likely to respond towards human when they were in larger groups. In contrast, zebras and Thomson's gazelles were marginally significantly more likely to show a response when in larger groups. Responses of all species were significantly or marginally significantly (elephant) lower with increasing distance from observers (an increase by one meter distance changed the response likelihood by 0.01-0.30). Four species (zebra, wildebeest, impala, dik dik) showed a gradual adjustment of responsiveness according to conservation status and were most responsive in non-protected and least responsive in fully protected areas (0.02-0.29 times less responsive in fully vs. multiple-use areas). However, elephants, giraffes and both gazelle species did not significantly adjust their behaviour according to conservation status. This suggests that the behaviour of some species can be used as useful indicator of conservation status of an area whereas the behaviour of other species does not allow discriminating between management types. More generally, our study highlights the importance of assessing and controlling illegal hunting in multiple-use areas and suggests a stronger consideration of human-induced risk effects in the conservation of ungulates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2014,17,6,,,,,603,612,,10.1111/acv.12131,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

I studied wild elk in Banff and Jasper National Parks, Canada, where habituated animals enter into conflicts with humans, abandon migration, and negatively affect entire ecosystems. I recorded lateral bedding postures and lateral differences in detection distances when elk were approached. Elk had leftward posture biases when facing away from the herd toward the presumptive direction of potential predation, but had rightward biases when facing towards conspecifics. I found migratory elk had stronger lateral biases than elk residing year-round near humans. These results show lateral posture biases are context dependent on risk, and as these risks change, lateral biases change as well.

There are costs to antipredator defenses and the strength of prey responses to cues of predation likely depends on both the perceived level of risk and food availability. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the costs of nonlethal trait-mediated interactions impacting larvae can have carryover effects that alter life-history traits, adult characteristics, and ultimately population dynamics. The effects of Toxorhynchites rutilus kairomones and chemical alarm cues on Aedes triseriatus were assessed in a two-level factorial design manipulating nutrient level (low or high) and chemical cues of predation (present or absent). Nonlethal chemical cues of predation significantly decreased female survivorship and significantly decreased female size. Females emerged as adults significantly earlier when exposed to predation cues when there was high nutrient availability. When raised in the low nutrient treatment and exposed to predator cues, adult females had 2.1 times the hazard of death compared to high nutrient-no predator cues. Females raised in the high nutrient and predator cue treatment blood fed sooner than did females from other combinations.

We studied avoid-approach conflict in rats that were behaving in a predator-inhabited foraging arena task that involved tangible threat and reward incentives. In the task, rats exhibited a variety of both fearful and anxious behaviors corresponding to proximal and distal threat, respectively. We then administered ethanol or diazepam to the rats in order to study how anxiolytics affected these fear and anxiety behaviors. We discovered that both ethanol and diazepam attenuated proximal-threat fear-like behaviors. Furthermore, we found that diazepam, but not ethanol, increased distal-threat anxiety-like behavior but also made rats less risk-averse.

In non-human species, female cues can also increase mate risk taking, reducing their responses to predator threat. As estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ER alpha and ER beta) are involved in the mediation of social and sexual responses, we investigated their roles in determining the effects of female-associated cues on mate risk taking. We examined the effects of brief pre-exposure to the odors of either a novel or familiar estrous female on the avoidance of, and aversive responses to, predator threat (cat odor) in ER alpha and ER beta wild type (alpha ERWT, beta ERWT) and gene-deleted (knockout, alpha ERKO, beta ERKO) mate mice. Exposure of alpha ERWT and alpha ERWT mates to the odors of a novel, but not a familiar, estrous female mouse resulted in enhanced risk taking with the mates displaying reduced avoidance of, and analgesic responses to, cat odor. In contrast, alpha ERKO mate mice failed to show any changes in risk taking, while beta ERKO mates, although displaying greater risk taking, did not distinguish between novel and familiar females, displaying similarly reduced avoidance responses to cat odor after exposure to either a novel or familiar female odor. These findings indicate that the gene for ER alpha is associated with the sexual mechanisms (response to estrous female) and the genes for ER beta and ER alpha with the social (recognition of novel female) mechanisms underlying the effects of female cues on mate risk taking.

Our previous work showed that habituated baboons displayed individually distinct and consistent responses to human approaches, a tolerance trait, but it is unknown if the trait is resilient to life-threatening scenarios. If it were consistent, it would imply FIDs might measure specific human threat perception only and not generalize to other threats such as predators when animals have experienced habituation processes. We used FID procedures to compare baseline responses to the visual orientation distance, FID, and individual tolerance estimates assessed after a leopard predation on an adult male baboon (group member). All variables were consistent despite the predation event, suggesting tolerance to observers was largely unaffected by the predation and FID procedures are unlikely to be generalizable to other threats when habituation has occurred.

Animals migrating outside of protected areas can be exposed to greater human pressure, and this effect can be stronger when humans are perceived to be a predation risk, such as during hunting seasons. Using four consecutive years of satellite telemetry data (n = 138 migration events), we compared habitat selection, movement, and behavior of a large partially migratory herbivore while migrating through a heterogeneous landscape in spring and fall. We tested the hypothesis that fall hunting exacerbates the response of a large herbivore exposed to human disturbance while migrating through a road network. All elk (Cervus elaphus) selected greater forest cover, reduced movement rates, and avoided roads during fall-day than in any other season or time of day. Avoidance of roads was reduced during spring at night, for example, the time period of no hunting with fewest people on roads. Elk using stopovers in fall displayed different seasonal and diurnal behaviors between sexes in response to the disturbance. Females used steeper terrain during fall-day and males did not use this strategy in fall. Male avoidance of roads was much stronger than females during fall-day and males were less likely to cross a road during fall. Such responses are probably linked to higher hunting pressure on males vs. females. Finally, we found that elk spent more time feeding during spring migration compared to the fall migration and elk vigilance was > 3 times higher in the fall hunting season. Our results provide insights into the effect of fear of humans on the ecology of both sexes of a migrating large herbivore when using stopovers. Such changes in behavior and stopover use might affect animal fitness by decreasing foraging, cause displacement from high-quality habitats, or affect the permeability of migration route stopovers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2017,8,6,,,,,,,e01841,10.1002/ecs2.1841,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Recent studies have revealed that brown bears (Ursus arctos) may kill substantial numbers of reindeer calves (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in forest areas in Sweden. Several authors have suggested that predation risk is an important driver of habitat selection in wild Rangifer populations where predation is a limiting factor, but little is known about these mechanisms in semi-domesticated populations. We examined the habitat selection of female reindeer in relation to spatial and temporal variations in brown bear predation risk on the reindeer calving grounds and evaluated the simultaneous responses of brown bears and reindeer to landscape characteristics. We used GPS data from 110 reindeer years (97 individuals) and 29 brown bear years (19 individuals), from two reindeer herding districts in the forest area of northern Sweden. Our results did not indicate that reindeer alter their behavior in response to spatiotemporal variation in brown bear predation risk, on the scale of the calving range. Instead, we suggest that spatiotemporal behavioral adjustments by brown bears were the main driver of prey-predator interactions in our study system. Contrasting responses by brown bears and reindeer to clear-cuts and young forest indicate that forestry can influence species interactions and possibly yield negative consequences for the reindeer herd. Even if clear-cuts may be beneficial in terms of calf survival, logging activity will eventually cause greater abundance of young regenerating forest, reducing available reindeer habitats and increasing habitat preferred by brown bears. Domestication may have made semi-domesticated reindeer in Fennoscandia less adapted to cope with predators. Areal restrictions, limiting the opportunity for dispersion and escape, possibly make the calves more susceptible to predation. Also, a generally higher population density in semi-domesticated herds compared to wild populations can make dispersion a less efficient strategy and the reindeer calves easier prey. Overall, the lack of ability of the reindeer females to reduce brown bear encounter risk on the scale of the calving range is probably an important reason for the high brown bear predation rates on reindeer calves documented in our study areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2016,7,11,,,,,,,e01583,10.1002/ecs2.1583,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Anthropogenic landscape modification, or human footprint, is well documented as a central cause of large mammal decline and range contractions where the proximal mechanisms of decline are often contentious. Direct mortality is an obvious cause; alternatively, human-modified landscapes perceived as unsuitable by some species may contribute to shifts in space use through preferential habitat selection. A useful approach to tease these effects apart is to determine whether behaviors potentially associated with risk vary with human footprint. We hypothesized wolverine (Gulo gulo) behaviors vary with different degrees of human footprint. We quantified metrics of behavior, which we assumed to indicate risk perception, from photographic images from a large existing camera-trapping dataset collected to understand wolverine distribution in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We systematically deployed 164 camera sites across three study areas covering approximately 24,000 km 2, sampled monthly between December and April (2007-2013). Wolverine behavior varied markedly across the study areas. Variation in behavior decreased with increasing human footprint. Increasing human footprint may constrain potential variation in behavior, through either restricting behavioral plasticity or individual variation in areas of high human impact. We hypothesize that behavioral constraints may indicate an increase in perceived risk in human-modified landscapes. Although survival is obviously a key contributor to species population decline and range loss, behavior may also make a significant contribution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2016,6,5,,,,,1493,1503,,10.1002/ece3.1921,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The species confidence hypothesis posits that birds are attracted to colors found on their bodies and repelled by non-body colors. Here, we extend this hypothesis taxonomically and conceptually to test whether this pattern is applicable in a non-avian reptile and to suggest that species should respond less fearfully to their sexually-selected signaling color. Responses to clothing color could also be impacted by habituation to humans, so we examine whether behavior varied between areas with low and high human activity. We quantified the effects of four T-shirt colors on flight initiation distances (FID) and on the ease of capture in western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), and we accounted for detectability against the background environment. We found no differences in lizard behavior between sites. However, lizards tolerated the closest approaches and were most likely to be captured when approached with the T-shirt that resembled their sexually-selected signaling color.

However, the act of trapping provides two types of conditional benefits (food from the bait when hungry, and refuge from a predator when threatened) against one type of drawback (confinement). Our understanding of how animals assess the two benefits against the lone risk determines how we interpret classic field studies in chemical ecology and wildlife management. Here, we studied wood mice responses to these risks and rewards of field trapping by examining experience through recapture and faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) as a physiological response indicator. Wood mice were live-trapped in two different plots subjected to two distinct phases: phase 1, absence of predator cues, and phase 2, in which traps were treated with red fox faeces. During phase 1, the recapture percentage was lower indicating that mice avoided traps while FCM levels in recaptured mice were higher. On the contrary, during phase 2, despite the total number of captures was lower we found an increase in the recapture percentage and FCM levels did not increase in recaptured mice.

Human habitation can influence desert ecosystems directly through changes in land use and indirectly through the introduction of alien species that compete with locally adapted fauna. Native species can respond to these processes by spatial or temporal avoidance. Ruppell's fox is a desert-adapted species inhabiting flat, rocky arid areas that feeds mainly on invertebrates and rodents. We used location data and step selection functions to study the space use of a population in southern Israel. We hypothesized that Ruppell's fox movement would be influenced by topography due to preference for creeks, where insects and rodents are available, and by human infrastructure as the presence of humans, vehicles and associated animals may induce a fear effect on native species. Ruppell's fox habitat selection was seasonal. During the dry season, foxes showed preference for flatter areas and creek bottoms and avoided paved roads. During the rainy season, foxes avoided less- trafficked dirt roads. These patterns were likely a consequence of increased territoriality due to denning in the colder season and reduced availability of insects in the dry season. Avoidance of paved and dirt roads may be explained by fear of human presence and perception of risk due to the use of linear features by larger carnivores, such as wolves and red foxes. Our results suggest that current protected, remote and uninhabited areas have an elevated value for the persistence of Ruppell's fox populations.

Gulls readily exploit anthropogenic food sources (e.g. rubbish dumps and other places of human refuse) and often 'steal' food from people eating out of doors. Their behaviour suggests that gulls perceive little risk around people and so we examined whether opportunity costs, that is access to anthropogenic food sources, influence risk monitoring and escape responses in Silver Gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) around outdoor restaurants ('food' sites), where the gulls would scavenge food from people. We recorded alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) and compared them with nearby sites where the same cohort of gulls was not interacting with people ('no-food' sites). We used two approach speeds (with the prediction that gulls would take greater efforts to avoid a potential predation threat when approached at speed). Gulls foraging at food sites had lower AD and FID than those approached at no-food sites. They were not simply ignoring the person, as they demonstrated longer AD when approached at speed but no difference in FID and therefore appeared to be responding to a small geographic scale 'behavioural footprint' of anthropogenic influences. Our study also challenges universality of the assumption that starting distance is necessarily correlated with FID, especially in sites where there are many people that animals are constantly monitoring - to determine the risk they represent as well as the likelihood of potential food opportunities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2017,123,3,,,,,205,212,,10.1111/eth.12587,,,,,,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Human globalisation has further expanded its range, so that today they are found on most continents. Despite their abundance, knowledge of fox behaviour remains limited. Most studies have observed foxes either in captivity or in their native range where both they and their predators are killed by humans. We conducted a behavioural study on foxes outside of their native range in Australia, at a unique location where all wildlife are protected. We developed an ethogram to explore fox behaviour at resource points shared with a potentially deadly apex predator, the dingo. We were surprised to find that foxes were in a confident state more often than in a cautious state, even leaving territorial markings over those of dingoes. One possible explanation for the confidence of foxes is that the social stability of both foxes and dingoes makes their world more predictable. Abstract: The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a widespread and ecologically significant terrestrial mesopredator, that has expanded its range with human globalisation. Despite this, we know relatively little about their behaviour under the wide range of ecological conditions they experience, particularly how they navigate the risk of encounters with apex predators. We conducted the first ethological study of foxes outside their historic native range, in Australia, where both the foxes and their main predator were protected from human hunting. Using remote camera traps, we recorded foxes visiting key resource points regularly utilised by territorial dingoes (Canis dingo), their local apex predator, in the Painted Desert, South Australia. We constructed an ethogram sensitive to a range of behaviours and attitudes. Since foxes are suppressed by dingoes, we expected that the foxes would primarily be in a cautious state. In contrast, we found that foxes were in a confident state most of the time. Where human hunting is absent, social stability of predators may increase predictability and therefore decrease fear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,9,11,,,,,,,907,10.3390/ani9110907,,,,,,Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

In this realistic situation, BA cells increased their firing rates and dHPC place cells decreased their spatial stability near the threat.

Mecp2 functions as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes. Identification of the role of Mecp2 in specific neurodevelopmental symptoms remains an important research aim. We previously demonstrated that male mice possessing a truncation mutation in Mecp2 are hyper-social. We predicted that reduced fear or anxiety might underlie this enhanced affiliation. In order to probe risk assessment and anxiety-like behavior, we compared Mecp2 truncation mutants to their wild-type littermates in the elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze. Additionally, subjects were administered the mouse defense test battery to evaluate unconditioned fear- and panic-like behavior to a graded set of threat scenarios and a predator stimulus. Mutant mice showed no significant changes in anxiety-like behavior. Yet, they displayed hyper-reactive escape and defensive behaviors to an animate predatory threat stimulus. Notably, mutant mice engaged in exaggerated active defense responding to threat stimuli at nearly all phases of the fear battery. These results reveal abnormalities in emotion regulation in Mecp2 mutants particularly in response to ecologically relevant threats. This hyper-responsivity suggests that transcriptional targets of Mecp2 are critical to emotion regulation. Moreover, we suggest that detailed analysis of defensive behavior and aggression with ethologically relevant tasks provides an avenue to interrogate gene-behavior mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and other psychiatric conditions.

Although all groups reacted differently to human presence, overall, gibbons responded by reducing time spent on conspicuous behavior (e.g., vocalizing, feeding, traveling, and social interactions) as the number of humans in the area increased or distance to the nearest human decreased. In addition, gibbon responses to encountering humans were also more like their responses to encountering potential predators than they were to encountering monkeys or other gibbons.

We tested whether predator scent in the form of hair would enhance perceived risk and serve as a foraging repellent to free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). During the winters of 2013 and 2014, we quantified alert behaviors and consumption of whole-kernel corn in response to current (coyote [Canis latrans]) and extirpated (bobcat [Lynx rufus]; black bear [Ursus americanus]) predator species alone and in combination with a partial visual barrier. Due to changes in herd dynamics and weather conditions, we did not compare results between years. We found enhanced alert behavior in all experiments except the 2014 exposure to coyote hair. Alert behaviors were heightened for about 4 days after hair placement. However, corn consumption was reduced only in the 2013 coyote-hair experiment.

This is especially true for large carnivores as these species are not always tolerated by the public and can pose a risk to human safety. Unfortunately, information on wildlife species within the wildland-urban interface is sparse, and knowledge from wildland ecosystems does not always translate well to human-dominated systems. Across western North America, cougars (Puma concolor) are routinely utilizing wildland-urban habitats while human use of these areas for homes and recreation is increasing. From 2007 to 2015, we studied cougar resource selection, human-cougar interaction, and cougar conflict management within the wildland-urban landscape of the northern Front Range in Colorado, USA. Resource selection of cougars within this landscape was typical of cougars in more remote settings but cougar interactions with humans tended to occur in locations cougars typically selected against, especially those in proximity to human structures. Within higher housing density areas, 83% of cougar use occurred at night, suggesting cougars generally avoided human activity by partitioning time. Only 24% of monitored cougars were reported for some type of conflict behavior but 39% of cougars sampled during feeding site investigations of GPS collar data were found to consume domestic prey items. Aversive conditioning was difficult to implement and generally ineffective for altering cougar behaviors but was thought to potentially have long-term benefits of reinforcing fear of humans in cougars within human-dominated areas experiencing little cougar hunting pressure. Cougars are able to exploit wildland-urban landscapes effectively, and conflict is relatively uncommon compared with the proportion of cougar use. Individual characteristics and behaviors of cougars within these areas are highly varied; therefore, conflict management is unique to each situation and should target individual behaviors. The ability of individual cougars to learn to exploit these environments with minimal human-cougar interactions suggests that maintaining older age structures, especially females, and providing a matrix of habitats, including large connected open-space areas, would be beneficial to cougars and effectively reduce the potential for conflict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,9,18,,,,,10415,10431,,10.1002/ece3.5559,,AUG 2019,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Thirteen waterpans were monitored during daylight hours between years 2015 and 2017 and responses of waterbirds to the three forms of disturbances were recorded. Logistic regressions revealed that the likelihood of responding was highest after terrestrial threats; with individuals/groups that were initially engaged in non-feeding activities that allowed vigilance, responding the most. Wildfowl species spent significantly longer time flying (compared to waders and generalists), more so in communal areas (CAs) than HNP, and after terrestrial threats compared to aerial threats and herbivore disturbances. We did not find any differences in probability of responding across land uses probably because there is less human disturbance in HNP, but predation risk is high. Further, even though there are less terrestrial predators in CAs, domestic dogs may be maintaining the stimuli. We conclude that terrestrial threats are least tolerated, with species most susceptible to human predation (i.e. wildfowl) losing more time avoiding them. Interestingly, only acute aerial threats induced departure from waterpans.

Humans are often perceived as predators by prey and therefore respond fearfully to humans. Thus, fish responses to humans inside and outside of an MPA can provide insights into their perception of humans as a predatory threat. Previous studies have found differences in the distance that harvested species of fish initiate flight (flight initiation distance-FID) from humans inside and outside an MPA, but less is known about unharvested species. We focused on whether the lined bristletooth Ctenochaetus striatus, an unharvested surgeonfish, can discriminate between a snorkeler and a snorkeler with a spear gun inside and outside of a no-take MPA in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Additionally, we incorporated starting distance (the distance between the person and prey at the start of an experimental approach), a variable that has been found to be important in assessing prey escape decisions in terrestrial species, but that has not been extensively studied in aquatic systems. Lined bristletooth FID was significantly greater in the presence of a spear gun and varied depending on if the spear gun encounter was inside or outside of the MPA.

In many studies of antipredator behavior in prey animals, simulated threats, such as human activities (movements, approaching prey), have been used as experimental threat factors, often in controlled circumstances, while prey responses to other animals in natural environments have been less investigated. This paper discusses the responses of goitered gazelles in the wild during encounters with various animals in their natural habitat to evaluate their cues used to assess the magnitude of potential threats. This study found that the goitered gazelles' behavioral responses to perceived risk differed across the various species sharing their habitat, with kulan recognized as a minimal threat and Siberian ibex the most threatening among ungulates. Among predators, the fox caused the least fear, while a horseman with a dog was identified as the greatest threat, with a wolf falling in between. Goitered gazelles adjusted their responses depending on the traits of the species encountered, while the features and conditions in their local environment played a less significant role. During encounters with other species, the gazelles ranked them according to their potential risk level based on the animal's appearance and behavior. The gazelles did distinguish between predators and other species and reacted to them differently: from pursuing and harassing the smallest (fox), to a panicky, running escape from their most dangerous natural predator (wolf), and especially from their most lethal, non-natural predator (herdsmen-mainly local poachers). Thus, this study suggested that goitered gazelles differentiate between predator species, assess their traits and intentions in each particular setting, and respond in the most advantageous way to each threat challenge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,65,1,,,,,141,149,,10.1007/s13364-019-00457-y,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Changes to their populations reverberate through ecological communities; consequently their widespread decline in numbers and shrinking distribution due to human persecution has brought about a loss and reconfiguration of biological diversity in many systems. Although many large carnivore populations are now under conservation-minded management, political and economic constraints make compromises necessary. A common compromise is to permit limited harvests, with the premise of sustainability and the objective to increase tolerance and funding for carnivore recovery and conservation. Here we question whether a large carnivore that has to look over its shoulder for human hunters can still fully perform its ecological role at the apex of a trophic system. We use information about carnivore behavior, ecology, trophic interactions, and the effects of human exploitation to argue that exploitation of large carnivores, even if sustainable numerically, undermines the commonly expressed rationale for their conservation, namely the restoration and preservation of ecosystem functionality. Our argument centers around (i) the necessity of behavioral adjustments in large carnivores to anthropomorphic risk, which may limit their contribution to the landscape of fear, and (ii) the observation that many of the same features that put large carnivores at the apex of trophic systems also make them vulnerable to human exploitation and persecution, with implicit consequences for their ecological functionality and evolution. Although hunting large carnivores can improve public acceptance, managers must be aware of the trade-offs. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As roads often have a negative effect on populations of birds and mammals, their effects are important for wildlife management. However, the effect of roads differ between different types of roads, and most studies of road ecology have focused on major roads with high traffic intensity, whilst effects of smaller unpaved forest roads in northern ecosystems are less known. We investigated the effects of forest roads in a mixed conifer forest in central Europe on cervid habitat use and browsing impact on forest regeneration during the winter season. We found that hunted cervid species avoided forest roads, and that browsing pressure was higher within the core of forest areas rather than close to roads. This led to an increased density of undamaged trees (by browsing) close to forest roads, whilst browsing damages were relatively high in the interior. Hunters often use these forest roads in the hunting season. We suggest that human disturbance creates corridors of fear along forest roads, and that cervids alter their habitat and browse use to avoid humans. This in turn has implications for forest and cervid management. This is the first study to document that gravel roads can affect oak trees through modifying cervid behavior. Future studies should use experiments to explore this question further and separate different effects of forest roads to understand the mechanisms; edge effects on vegetation, traffic, effects on natural predators and human disturbance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 15,2018,424,,,,,,378,386,,10.1016/j.foreco.2018.04.057,,,,,,Forestry,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, other drivers, such as climate, landscape structure and the level of human activity, have a strong influence on deer pressure. The direct, density-related impacts of ungulates on forest regeneration have been well studied, but there is limited empirical evidence related to the indirect factors mentioned above. We conducted a field experiment in three forest divisions in Poland to evaluate the role of a common element of human infrastructure, i.e. small, unpaved forestry roads. Additionally, we assessed the modifying effect of visibility driven by vegetation cover and forage availability. RESULTS The proximity of unpaved roads affected deer habitat use and foraging behaviour, and limited browsing pressure on regenerating forests. Low visibility and higher winter forage availability increased the probability of tree browsing. We observed different responses to roads in two deer species: red deer avoided roads, while roe deer browsed in the vicinity of roads. CONCLUSIONS A typical forest network of unpaved roads creates a landscape of fear for red and roe deer, and limits browsing pressure on regenerating forests due to the changes in deer habitat use, activity patterns and foraging behaviour. Knowledge of the factors influencing browsing pressure can help to spatially optimise the application of protective measures for tree seedlings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,77,2,,,,,628,634,,10.1002/ps.6207,,DEC 2020,,,,Agriculture; Entomology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Flight initiation distance (FID) is often studied in the context of island tameness; however, little is known about the factors that influence and maintain FID variation in predation-free populations. Here, we studied FID in foals of an isolated predator-free population of feral horses (Equus caballus L., 1758) on Sable Island, Canada, to determine if FID could be used for research on consistent individual differences in risk aversion and island tameness. In addition to testing for temporal, spatial, and sex effects on FID, we compared repeatability estimates at two temporal scales (within and among days). Similar FID for measurements obtained on the same day and for males and females indicated an absence of short-term desensitization and sex effects.

Retaliatory persecution such as poisoning threatens predators, but also non-target biota. Several factors influence conflict severity, including livestock husbandry, overlap in seasonal habitat use, and the degree to which livestock perceive and are able to respond to a landscape of fear. We investigated these factors by GPS-tracking 42 Tswana beef cattle (Bos taunts) from 29 herds in 2017 and six lions (Panthera leo) from different prides (May 2016-Dec. 2017) in the northern Okavango Delta, Botswana, where cattle depredation significantly impacts the livelihoods of rural agro-pastoralists. Cattle exhibited seasonal habitat selection patterns similar to wild ungulates in the region. They preferred woodland habitats, with more digestible grasses, during the wet season. During the dry season, they preferred wetland habitats with reliable forage and water availability. Cattle also preferred areas close to human settlements, but the necessity to forage in wetlands during the dry season exposed them to significant depredation risk, especially > 4 km from settlements. Lions killed most cattle in wetlands during the late dry season but the intensity of recent lion presence (previous 14 days) only had a weak negative effect on cattle habitat selection patterns. Cattle used rangelands according to nutritional requirements, irrelevant of the associated predation risk, suggesting that socio-ecologically acceptable conflict solutions cannot rely on the exclusion of livestock from seasonal wetlands. Curbing depredation by lions will best be achieved by a combination of resource- and predation-cognisant seasonal herding strategies with adequate livestock protection. Understanding the ecological constraints that intensify conflict is pertinent to any livestock production landscape with predator presence. It is also a central prerequisite for future land use planning and devolution of legal, controlled resource access rights through policy. Coexistence strategies must account for the strong reliance of people, their livestock, and wildlife on shared key resources. This is particularly important In large trans-frontier conservation areas where the successful merging of biodiversity conservation and rural development is a strategic goal. Omission will foster resentment and resistance to coexistence with apex predators, particularly if livestock productivity and human livelihoods are negatively affected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,237,,,,,,253,266,,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.06.031,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Understanding this variation may allow us to understand how 'fear' structures communities, as well as to predict which species are likely to coexist with humans. I used flight initiation distance (FID) as a comparative metric of wariness and examined the relative importance of life history and natural history traits in explaining variation in FID in 150 species of birds. In a series of comparative analyses, I used independent contrasts to control for phylogenetic similarity and regressed continuous life history traits against flight initiation distance. Body size had a large and significant effect in explaining variation in flightiness: larger species initiated flight at greater distances than smaller species. After controlling for variation explained by body size, there was a nonsignificant positive relation between the age of first reproduction and FID. There were no relations between FID and clutch size, number of days spent feeding young, longevity, or habitat density. I used concentrated changes tests to look for evidence of coevolution between flightiness and dichotomous traits. Flightiness evolved multiple times and some clades were flightier than others. Flightiness was more likely to evolve in omnivorous/carnivorous species and in cooperatively breeding species. These results suggest that body size and age of first reproduction are important in explaining variation in disturbance tolerance in birds, and that species that capture live prey and those that are highly social are relatively wary. The results suggest a novel mechanism of how anthropogenic disturbance may contribute to extinction. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The increased human presence has modified fishes' antipredator behavioural responses, and consequently flight decisions, as a function of their changed perceptions of risk. Understanding how fish react to human presence can help identify the most vulnerable functional groups/species and estimate impacts caused by human disturbance. Shoal and body size are known to influence fish flight initiation distance (FID; the distance between the predator and prey when the prey begins to escape); however, few studies attempt to test the moderators of these relationships. Here, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating FID of fish in response to human presence. Specifically, we investigated six candidate moderators that could influence the relationship between FID with shoal and body size. Our results showed that individual fish size was strongly and positively correlated with FID and the most important moderator that explained the variance in individual body size-FID relationship was shoaling behaviour. However, and somehow surprisingly, we detected no significant relationship between shoal size and FID.

Changing risk landscapes may reduce benefits associated with home range fidelity, however, and philopatric animals may alter movement in response to new pressures. Despite the importance of range changes to ecological and evolutionary processes, little tracking data have been collected over the long-term nor has range change been recorded in response to human pressures across generations. Here, we investigate the relationships between ecological, demographic and human variables and elephant ranging behaviour across generations using 16 years of tracking data from nine distinct female social groups in a population of elephants in northern Kenya that was heavily affected by ivory poaching during the latter half of the study. Nearly all groups-including those that did not experience loss of mature adults- exhibited a shift north over time, apparently in response to increased poaching in the southern extent of the study area. However, loss of mature adults appeared to be the primary indicator of range shifts and expansions, as generational turnover was a significant predictor of range size increases and range centroid shifts. Range expansions and northward shifts were associated with higher primary productivity and lower poached carcass densities, while westward shifts exhibited a trend to areas with higher values of primary productivity and higher poached carcass densities relative to former ranges. Together these results suggest a trade-off between resource access, mobility and safety.

We also deployed carnivore scent stations to estimate activity levels of potential deer predators, conducted deer dung count surveys to control for effects of deer abundance, and controlled for topographic aspect, a primary determinant of vegetative biomass and community composition. We found a significant, positive correlation between giving-up densities in deer and the densities of A. americanum, but no effect of canid predators, deer abundance, or topographic aspect. Our results are consistent with the few other empirical examples that demonstrate nonconsumptive effects of parasites on their hosts.

We detected a significant increase of mean and size effects of FID when the observer was equipped with a speargun. Such effects were more evident outside marine protected areas where spearfishing was allowed and was commensurate to the historically spearfishing pressure of each investigated taxon.

This risk might have been a selective pressure on the evolution of primate visual and cognitive systems, leading to several behavioral traits present in human and non-human primates, such as the ability to quickly learn to fear snakes. Primates seldom prey on snakes, and humans are one of the few primate species that do. We report here another case, the wild capuchin monkey (Sapajus libidinosus), which preys on snakes. We hypothesized that capuchin monkeys, due to their behavioral plasticity, and cognitive and visual skills, would be capable of discriminating dangerous and non-dangerous snakes and behave accordingly. We recorded the behavioral patterns exhibited toward snakes in two populations of S. libidinosus living 320 km apart in Piaui, Brazil. As expected, capuchins have a fear reaction to dangerous snakes (usually venomous or constricting snakes), presenting mobbing behavior toward them. In contrast, they hunt and consume non-dangerous snakes without presenting the fear response. Our findings support the tested hypothesis that S. libidinosus are capable of differentiating snakes by level of danger: on the one hand they protect themselves from dangerous snakes, on the other hand they take opportunities to prey on non-dangerous snakes. Since capuchins and humans are both predators and prey of snakes, further studies of this complex relationship may shed light on the evolution of these traits in the human lineage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2018,59,1,,,,,99,106,,10.1007/s10329-017-0631-x,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We examined two defenses, flight initiation distance and tail autotomy. Flight initiation distance generally decreased with declining predator diversity. All predator types had distinctive effects on flight initiation distance with mammals and birds having the largest estimated effects. Rates of autotomy observed in the field were highest on predator-free islands, yet laboratory-induced autotomy increased linearly with overall predator diversity.

There were striking differences in behaviour among models; high-risk models showed a weaker response to the predator cue and became neophobic in response to the control cue (a novel odour, NO). Observers that were previously paired with low-risk models acquired a strong antipredator response only to the predator cue. However, observers that interacted with high-risk models, displayed a much weaker response to the predator odour and a weak neophobic response to the NO. This is the first study reporting such different outcomes of social learning under different environmental conditions, and suggests high-risk environments promote the cultural transmission of neophobia more so than social learning.

Moreover, overexpression of AVP within this population is sufficient to reduce aversion to predator odors. The loss of fear of the predator odor occurs in parallel with increased recruitment of AVP neurons within the MePD.

We hypothesized that blackbuck would show flexible habitat-use behaviour and be risk averse when resource quality in the landscape is high, and less sensitive to risk otherwise. Overall, blackbuck appeared to be strongly influenced by human activity and they offset risks by using small protected patches (similar to 3 km(2)) when they could afford to do so. Blackbuck habitat use varied dynamically corresponding with seasonally-changing levels of resources and risks, with protected habitats registering maximum use.

When aggressive, physically dominant species are displaced by anthropogenic disturbance, physically weaker species exploit competitor and predator downtimes to forage in previously risky places. Birds feeding at outdoor restaurants and cafes in association with humans are exposed to fluctuating levels of perceived danger caused by frequently changing densities of human diners. Consequently, birds must make decisions about which dining tables to visit based on trade-offs between foraging gain and perceived danger from avian competitors and humans. We tested the hypothesis that interspecific differences in response to perceived danger, combined with varying densities of human diners, dynamically alter which bird species predominates at dining tables. We found that house sparrows (Passer domesticus) tolerated higher human diner-densities than larger-sized, more physically dominant Eurasian jackdaws (Coloeus monedula). Sparrows were usually the first birds to visit diner-occupied tables and spent more time there than jackdaws. However, at diner-abandoned tables, this pattern changed: During low diner-densities at surrounding tables, jackdaws were usually the predominant species in first visits and minutes spent visiting, while at high diner-densities sparrows usually predominated. Moreover, along a gradient of increasing human diner-density, sparrows gradually replaced jackdaws as the predominant species in first visits and time at abandoned tables. However, at diner-occupied tables, once a sparrow chose which table to visit, factors other than diner-density influenced its choice of where to forage there (table-top or ground). To our knowledge, our research is the first scientific study of table-visiting behavior by birds at outdoor restaurants and cafes, and the first to reveal interspecific differences in table-visiting behavior by birds there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021,127,7,,,,,505,516,,10.1111/eth.13145,,MAY 2021,,,,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Here we demonstrate with experiments that wild American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos, respond to dead conspecifics by mobbing, increasing the time to approach food in areas associated with these events, and learning new predators based on their proximity to dead crows and hawks. Avoidance of either dead conspecifics or areas associated with them is not shared by another urban bird, the rock pigeon, Columba livia. Crows mobbed and increased the time to approach food over the next 72 h after observing novel humans paired with a dead crow, a red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis, or a hawk with a dead crow. The sight of a dead pigeon did not elicit these responses. These findings suggest that, for crows, dead conspecifics, but not dead heterospecifics, represent a salient danger akin to the observation of a predator. On the day the stimulus was presented, the number of trials that resulted in mobbing and avoidance of the food was strongest when crows were presented a hawk with a dead crow. In addition, we demonstrate that crows use the proximity of a human to predators, to dead conspecifics and to predators with dead conspecifics as cues to learn to recognize and subsequently scold the associated human after only one training event, and that this association can last 6 weeks. Together, our results support previous findings that crows learn places associated with conspecific death, and further demonstrate that crows can learn and remember people who appear complicit in these events.

Large raptors are often shown or presumed to be vulnerable to collision and are demographically sensitive to additional mortality, as exemplified by several studies of the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos. Previous findings from Scottish Eagles, however, have suggested avoidance as the primary response. Our study used data from 59 GPS-tagged Golden Eagles with 28 284 records during natal dispersal before and after turbine operation < 1 km of 569 turbines at 80 wind farms across Scotland. We tested three hypotheses using measurements of tag records' distance from the hub of turbine locations: (1) avoidance should be evident; (2) older birds should show less avoidance (i.e. habituate to turbines); and (3) rotor diameter should have no influence (smaller diameters are correlated with a turbine's age, in examining possible habituation). Four generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were constructed with intrinsic habitat preference of a turbine location using Golden Eagle Topography (GET) model, turbine operation status (before/after), bird age and rotor diameter as fixed factors. The best GLMM was subsequently verified by k-fold cross-validation and involved only GET habitat preference and presence of an operational turbine. Eagles were eight times less likely to be within a rotor diameter's distance of a hub location after turbine operation, and modelled displacement distance was 70 m. Our first hypothesis expecting avoidance was supported. Eagles were closer to turbine locations in preferred habitat but at greater distances after turbine operation. Results on bird age (no influence to 5+ years) rejected hypothesis 2, implying no habituation. Support for hypothesis 3 (no influence of rotor diameter) also tentatively inferred no habituation, but data indicated birds went slightly closer to longer rotor blades although not to the turbine tower. We proffer that understanding why avoidance or collision in large raptors may occur can be conceptually envisaged via variation in fear of humans as the 'super predator' with turbines as cues to this life-threatening agent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,164,1,,,,,102,117,,10.1111/ibi.12996,,JUL 2021,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, little work has explored the learning of safety and how such learning outcomes are shaped by the social environment. Here, we exposed minnows, Pimephales promelas, to a high-risk environment to induce behavioural responses associated with fear (e.g. neophobia). We then used the presence of calm conspecific models (low-risk individuals) to weaken these responses. When observers (individuals from the high-risk environment) and models were paired consistently in a one-on-one setting, the observers showed no recovery (i.e. no weakening of the fear responses), and instead the models indirectly acquired those responses (i.e. a socially transmitted state of fear). However, observers paired with models that were periodically replaced with new calm models showed a significant recovery, and each new model showed diminished socially transmitted fear. We argue that our understanding of predation-related fear and social information transfer can prove fruitful in understanding problems with fear and stress across animal taxa, including among humans who experience post-traumatic stress and secondary trauma. Our findings indicate that the periodic replacement of models can promote fear recovery in observers and reduce socially transmitted fear in models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 10,2018,285,1888,,,,,,,20180739,10.1098/rspb.2018.0739,,,,,,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We analyze urban and rural burrowing owls' variation in risk perception along separate but consecutive days (Treatment 1) and risk perception within the same day (Treatment 2). Fear behaviour was measured as flight initiation distances (FIDs) and aggressiveness level when a pedestrian approached repeatedly to an owl individual. We predict that the attenuation in fear response along treatments should add support to the habituation hypothesis (decrease the response to a repeatedly stimulus after verifying that it is irrelevant) while consistency in behaviour might be indicative of a personality trait. We found that FID decreased for measurements made on both treatments in rural owls and also in urban owls for Treatment 2. These results are compatible with a habituation process. We found that aggressiveness remained invariable along treatments in both habitats suggesting that different mechanisms underlie these behavioural responses. Our results suggest that owls' risk perception to humans can be adjusted based on environmental risk perception and that individuals are able to recognize and learn when a stimuli stops being a threat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018,157,,,,,,250,255,,10.1016/j.beproc.2018.10.011,,,,,,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Both naive and experienced birds should thus react to such stimuli with fear reactions. However, studies on different species have shown the importance of experience in the development of these fear reactions. We hypothesized that the responses of adult European starlings to fear-inducing visual stimuli may differ according to experience. We compared the reactions of Hand-raised adults with no experience of predators to those of Wild-caught adults, with potentially extensive experience with predators. Three visual stimuli (i.e. human, raptor, snake) were broadcast to 17 birds as 2D pictures (displayed via a LCD screen) with different modalities of presentation: degree of proximity and with or without movement. The results reveal that the birds were particularly sensitive to proximity and movement, with more attention towards moving stimuli and more withdrawal for close stimuli. The human stimulus elicited attention in both the distant and moving modalities but, like the other stimuli, mostly withdrawal when it was close. Developmental experience appeared to influence the emotional level, as the Hand-raised birds reacted strongly to all stimuli and all modalities, contrarily to the WC birds which performed withdrawals almost only for close stimuli and attention to moving stimuli. Stimuli proximity and movement seemed, therefore, relevant features that elicited negative reactions in Wild-caught birds. The Hand-raised birds were equally attentive to both distant and moving stimuli. Thus the young birds showed no real discrimination. Early and later experiences may, therefore, influence birds' reactions. Starlings may require experience with real threats to develop adaptive responses, i.e. limiting unnecessary loss of energy by fleeing in front of non-dangerous stimuli.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018,21,6,,,,,749,758,,10.1007/s10071-018-1207-x,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Therefore, we predicted that antipredator behavior, here measured as escape behavior when captured by a human, would correlate with risk of parasite infection at the interspecific level with bolder species having more parasites than risk-averse species. Here we tested whether species with more active escape behavior also tended to have high prevalence of blood parasites, specifically hemosporidian parasites. Focusing on effect sizes we found that escape behavior was intermediately and positively related to prevalence of infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas that was not the case for the more virulent Plasmodium. Species that were habitat generalists and hence encountered a greater diversity of habitats had higher prevalence of blood parasites than specialists. In addition, some components of escape behavior were correlated at an intermediate magnitude with habitat exploration, as reflected by the relative frequency of feeding innovations, and coloniality. We failed to find considerable patterns of correlations between most of the behavioral variables and flight initiation distance, another commonly used antipredator behavior. Therefore, behavioral responses to an approaching predator and to being caught by a human likely represent 2 independent axes of antipredator behavior that do not evolve in concert. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that escape behavior is related to risk of infection with blood parasites partially mediated by the effect of habitat generalism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL-AUG,2014,25,4,,,,,890,900,,10.1093/beheco/aru066,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, a recent hypothesis, Flush Early and Avoid the Rush (FEAR), acknowledged that the cost of monitoring approaching predators might be a ubiquitous cost. The FEAR hypothesis predicts that prey will generally flee soon after they detect a predator so as to minimize the costs incurred by monitoring the predator. Knowing whether animals flee to reduce monitoring costs is of applied interest because wildlife managers use escape behavior to create set-back zones to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Here we provide the most comprehensive assessment of the FEAR hypothesis using data collected from 178 bird species representing 67 families from two continents. The FEAR hypothesis explains escape behavior in 79% of studied species. Because the FEAR hypothesis is a widespread phenomenon that drives escape behavior in birds, alert distance must be systematically incorporated into the design of set-back zones to protect vulnerable species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 23,2015,10,3,,,,,,,e0119906,10.1371/journal.pone.0119906,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

While observational data from systematic camera arrays have informed inferences on the spatiotemporal outcomes of predator-prey interactions, the capacity for observational studies to identify mechanistic drivers of species interactions is limited. Experimental study designs that utilize camera traps uniquely allow for testing hypothesized mechanisms that drive predator and prey behaviour, incorporating environmental realism not possible in the laboratory while benefiting from the distinct capacity of camera traps to generate large datasets from multiple species with minimal observer interference. However, such pairings of camera traps with experimental methods remain underutilized. We review recent advances in the experimental application of camera traps to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying predator-prey ecology and present a conceptual guide for designing experimental camera trap studies. Only 9% of camera trap studies on predator-prey ecology in our review use experimental methods, but the application of experimental approaches is increasing. To illustrate the utility of camera trap-based experiments using a case study, we propose a study design that integrates observational and experimental techniques to test a perennial question in predator-prey ecology: how prey balance foraging and safety, as formalized by the risk allocation hypothesis. We discuss applications of camera trap-based experiments to evaluate the diversity of anthropogenic influences on wildlife communities globally. Finally, we review challenges to conducting experimental camera trap studies. Experimental camera trap studies have already begun to play an important role in understanding the predator-prey ecology of free-living animals, and such methods will become increasingly critical to quantifying drivers of community interactions in a rapidly changing world. We recommend increased application of experimental methods in the study of predator and prey responses to humans, synanthropic and invasive species, and other anthropogenic disturbances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020,89,9,,,,,1997,2012,,10.1111/1365-2656.13264,,JUN 2020,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Although drive hunts are spatially and temporally well defined, the scale at which the hunting risk triggers anti-predator responses of prey remains poorly documented. The present study aims at 1) characterizing the delayed movement responses of female red deer Cervus elaphus to hunters and 2) understanding the main environmental determinants modulating these post-disturbance responses at the individual level. We hypothesized that red deer alter their movement behaviour for several days after a drive hunt by increasing their speed and exploring more space. Then, we predicted that individuals close to the hunting area would exhibit stronger responses (i.e. higher speed and larger home range size) than individuals located further away. We also expected topographic obstacles and vegetation cover to reduce the magnitude of the post-disturbance responses. We used GPS data from a large dataset collected on 91 female red deer in the National Hunting and Wildlife Reserve of La Petite Pierre (France), between 2004 and 2018. Each year, drive hunts are conducted by about 43 hunters and 6 dogs, once a week from October to February. Our results suggest that, over a 72-h period after a drive hunt, female red deer could show two contrasting strategies: 1) flight-type movements (i.e. higher maximum speed) associated with more space explored due to a temporary avoidance of the disturbed area and 2) lower movements to avoid detection and contacts with hunters. These two delayed responses are situation-specific, depending on risk proximity, landscape features, hunting conditions and individual characteristics. This study highlights that ungulate management using a 'hunting for fear' approach may be adjusted considering spatial and temporal scales of the effects of drive hunts on red deer movement patterns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,wlb.00545,10.2981/wlb.00545,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Subjects exhibited behavioral change significantly more often in response to the predator than to control stimuli, but did not distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar predators. Mammalian predator urine and feces were most likely to elicit behavioral change. The owl was the only predator to never elicit behavioral change, possibly because owls do not provide relevant odor cues. A second experiment employing live traps in the forest found that neither predator nor control odors affected the likelihood of capture. Due to their longevity, odors do not provide accurate information of spatial and temporal risk, and while mouse lemurs may have initially hesitated to enter a trap, in the absence of additional information about risk, they may have eventually ignored the stimuli.

For African elephants Loxodonta africana, human pressures from poaching and conflict are primary drivers of species decline, but little is known about how elephants structure their spatial behavior in the face of human occupancy and predation. We seek to understand how elephants balance trade-offs between resource access, human presence and human predatory risk factors (poaching and conflict killing) in an unfenced, dynamic ecosystem where elephants persist primarily outside protected areas in community rangelands. We used tracking data from 101 elephants collected between 2001 and 2016. We investigated elephant behavior in response to landcover, topography, productivity, water, human features and human predation risk using third-order resource selection functions. We extended this analysis by employing a mixed-effects multinomial regression to identify temporal shifts in habitat use, and evaluated temporal shifts in movement patterns by estimating mean squared displacement across different productivity periods. Across periods, elephants displayed strong selection for productive areas and areas near water. Temporal shifts in habitat use showed that, during the dry period, elephants were clustered around permanent water sources where humans also congregated. At the onset of the wet period, a shift occurred where elephants moved away from permanent water and from permanent settlements towards seasonal water sources and seasonal settlements. Our findings indicate that foraging and water access are important limiting factors affecting elephants that potentially restrain their spatial responses to humans at the scale of our analysis. Given that pastoralists and elephants rely on the same resources, increasing human and livestock populations enhance pressure on shared resources and space in Africa's drylands. The long-term conservation of elephants will require approaches that reduce poaching as well as landscape level planning to prevent negative impacts from increasing competition for preferred resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,43,1,,,,,149,160,,10.1111/ecog.04240,,OCT 2019,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We tested whether a common cause of threat status is susceptibility to human proximity. We did so by estimating whether 48 pairs of closely related bird species differing in their threat status consistently had longer flight initiation distances (FID, the distance at which the individual takes flight from an approaching human) in the more threatened species.

We applied principles of patch use and foraging theory to test foraging strategies and fear responses of three strains of Mus musculus: wild-caught, control laboratory, and genetically modified strains. Foraging choices were quantified using giving-up densities (GUDs) under three foraging scenarios: (1) patches varying in microhabitat (covered versus open), and initial resource density (low versus high); (2) daily variation in auditory cues (aerial predators and control calls); (3) patches with varying seed aggregations. Overall, both domestic strains harvested significantly more food than wild mice. Each strain revealed a significant preference for foraging under cover compared to the open, and predator calls had no detectable effects on foraging. Both domestic strains biased their harvest toward high quality patches; wild mice did not. In terms of exploiting favorable and avoiding unfavorable distributions of seeds within patches, the lab strain performed best, the wild strain worst, and the mutant strain in between. Our study provides support for hypothesis that domestic animals have more energy-efficient foraging strategies than their wild counterparts, but retain residual fear responses. Furthermore, patch-use studies can reveal the aptitudes and priorities of both domestic and wild animals. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Two different processes may modulate fish antipredator behavior in the waters off remote archipelagos. First, places with low human density may have reduced fishing pressure. Second, due to their remoteness and lack of other human impacts, these isolated places may have more intact fish assemblages. We investigated antipredator behavior off the smallest archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic not subjected to regular spearfishing by quantifying flight initiation distance (FID) ? the distance a diver can approach a fish before it flees. Our goal was to identify natural patterns of risk assessment in reef fish. We focused on five common species and investigated how body size, group size and depth influence on the FID. In contrast to previous studies, we found that Caranx lugubris had significantly negative relationships between body size and FID, whereas Kyphosus sectatrix showed an opposite relationship. Finally, only a single species (Melichthys niger) had a significant relationship between depth and FID. Given we found small FID for all species studied, we suggest that much of our understanding of fish antipredator behavior studied using FID may reflect the somewhat ubiquitous impact of humans on species' risk assessments and not reflect patterns seen in areas with very low human density/disturbance.

However, recently the thrift family of hypotheses have attracted serious criticism necessitating alternative thinking Optimization of foraging behaviour is an important aspect of behavioural evolution. For a species evolved for optimizing nutritional benefits against predation or other foraging risks, reduction in foraging risk below a threshold dramatically increases the steady-state body weight. In modem life where feeding is detached from foraging, the behavioural regulation mechanisms are likely to fail resulting into escalation of adiposity. At a proximate level the signalling pathways for foraging optimization involve fear induced signal molecules in the brain including Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART) interacting with adiposity signals such as leptin. While leptin promotes the expression of the fear peptides, the fear peptides promote anorectic action of leptin. This interaction promotes foraging drive and risk tolerance when the stored energy is low and suppresses hunger and foraging drive when the perceived risk is high. The ecological model of foraging optimization and the molecular model of interaction of these peptides converge in the outcome that the steady state adiposity is an inverse square root function of foraging risk. The foraging optimization model is independent of thrift or insurance hypotheses, but not mutually exclusive. We review existing evidence and suggest testable predictions of the model. Understanding obesity simultaneously at proximate and ultimate levels is likely to suggest effective means to curb the obesity epidemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,70,3,,,,,193,216,,10.1127/homo/2019/1078,,,,,,Anthropology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

There is increasing evidence that man-made (anthropogenic) factors can affect the behaviour of a wide range of taxa. However, few experimental studies have investigated how foraging behaviour is affected by exposure to increased noise levels, an issue of growing global concern. In our laboratory study, we examined how exposure to playback of noise originally recorded from ships, a prevalent source of human-generated underwater noise, affects the feeding behaviour of two sympatric fish species: the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus. Both species consumed significantly fewer live Daphnia magna, and showed startle responses significantly more often during playback of additional noise than during control conditions. However, whereas minnows showed a qualitative shift in activity away from foraging behaviour (greater inactivity, more social behaviour) under increased noise conditions, consistent with a classic stress-or fear-related defence cascade, sticklebacks maintained foraging effort but made more mistakes, which may result from an impact of noise on cognition. These findings indicate that additional noise in the environment can lead to reduced food consumption, but that the effects of elevated noise are species specific. It remains to be tested whether these interspecific differences translate into different ultimate impacts, but differential disruptions to foraging may have potential consequences for relative individual fitness and community structure.

Aim: We explored the role of these interactions in the risk of disease transmission (foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]) between cattle and the African buffalo (the maintenance host) and how a top predator, the lion, may modulate these interactions. Location: The interface of Hwange National Park (HNP) and surrounding communal lands, Zimbabwe. Method: We combined a longitudinal serological cattle survey for FMD, GPS-collar data and cattle owners' interviews during four seasons in 2010-2011. Results: Overall FMD incidence in cattle was low, but showed a peak during the rainy season. The incidence dynamic was significantly explained by cattle incursion into the protected area (i.e., buffer zone of 3 km inside HNP) and not by contacts with buffalo or contacts among cattle. These results suggest that FMD virus either survives in the environment or is transmitted by other ungulate groups or species. The analysis of incursion frequency in the buffer suggests that (1) buffalo and cattle are avoiding each other up to 2 months after one species track and that (2) lions make frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it, whereas buffalo did not use areas occupied by lions. Lions could thus reduce the spatio-temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the interface, which could contribute to the low level of FMD incidence. Main conclusions: During the rainy season, traditional herding practices push cattle away from growing crops near villages into the HNP but not during the dry season, suggesting that cattle owners may decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land in the dry season to avoid the risks of infection and/or predation in the HNP.

The adverse neuro-behavioural effects of Se have been investigated in both humans and fishes, but little is known about its effects on social behaviours or the serotonergic signaling pathway in the brain. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chorionic dietary exposure to Se (as selenomethionine) at different concentrations (control, 2.1, 11.6 or 31.5 mu g/g dry wt.) on antipredator avoidance, shoaling behaviour, and social group preferences in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, we also measured the expression of important genes in the serotonergic pathway that influence social behaviours. After 60 days of exposure, the highest dose (31.5 mu g/g dry wt.) caused the highest level of baseline fear behaviour, with fish swimming lower in the water column and in tighter shoals compared to fish in the other treatments. With high levels of baseline fear, these fish did not significantly intensify fear behaviours in response to predation risk in the form of exposure to chemical alarm cues. When individual fish were given an opportunity to shoal with groups of differing sizes (3 vs. 4 individuals), fish exposed to the high dose spent less time with groups in general, and only control fish showed a significant preference for the larger group. In the zebrafish brain, we found significant upregulation in the mRNA expression of serotonin receptors (htrlaa and htrl b), a transporter (slc6a4a), and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (tph2), whereas there was a downregulation of the monoamine oxidase (mao) gene. The results of this study suggest that disruption of serotonergic neurotransmission might have been responsible for Se-induced impairment of antipredator and social behaviour in zebrafish.

We investigated the vegetation-specific livestock predation by leopards in the BMR, as well as the consequences for livestock management and biodiversity preservation. Leopard killed livestock in 14 of the 22 vegetation types, of which Groot Valley Thicket, Cockscomb Mountain Fynbos and Baviaanskloof Mountain Fynbos were 'used' more than expected. Leopard predation was focused on the properties that bordered the reserve, but constituted a relatively small proportion of livestock losses on these properties. Farmers respond to this actual predation and perceived predation by removing livestock from areas bordering the reserve. Given the high levels of herbivory exerted on the vegetation by livestock, the removal of livestock may create plant refugia from herbivory. Thus, we propose that leopard predation may induce human-mediated behavioural effects on livestock which resembles the behavioural responses of herbivores to 'landscapes of fear'. Therefore, retaining top predators may assist in the conservation of biodiversity within multi-use landscapes by maintaining predator-prey dynamics and associated top-down processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2015,45,2,,,,,204,214,,10.3957/056.045.0204,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Smaller-bodied and less-experienced individuals are presumed to be more vulnerable to predators, suggesting that within-group spatial organization should show size- and age-dependent patterns in predator sensitive positioning. However, such effects have been difficult to evaluate for arboreal primates living in large groups. We conducted a preliminary study using a novel, spatially explicit method of assessing group spatial organization using GIS data in two groups of wild lowland Woolly monkeys, in which one group had a membership roughly twice as large as the second. In the larger group, group spread was more diffuse and large adult males were more frequently on the outskirts of the group than other age/sex classes, while immatures and females with dependents were more often in the center. Leaf cover around an individualpresumed to index an animal's perception of riskincreased significantly with distance from the group center for all immatures, although they were typically under lower leaf cover than adults; the number of groupmates in proximity also had an effect, but nearest neighbor distance did not. These differences were not detectable in the smaller group. This preliminary study suggests that thorough studies of spatial organization and predation risk sensitivity in arboreal primates are possible and could yield valuable information on how gregarious individuals offset ecological risks through social spacing.

Starving rodents, for example, will forage in areas that are more susceptible to predators and will also modulate aggressive behavior within a territory of limited or depleted nutrients. The neural basis of these adaptive behaviors likely involves circuits that link innate feeding, aggression and fear. Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are critically important for driving feeding and project axons to brain regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping techniques in mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which suppresses territorial aggression and reduces contextual fear. We propose that AgRP neurons serve as a master switch capable of coordinating behavioral decisions relative to internal state and environmental cues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2016,19,5,,,,,734,+,,10.1038/nn.4274,,,,,,Neurosciences & Neurology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Using a standardized walking approach method on focal bird individuals, we investigated whether different levels of vegetation cover (habitat) influence the perception of predation risk. To do this, we worked in an area of tropical dry forest in central Mexico that is currently part of a restoration ecology experiment. We hypothesized that restoration decreases individual's predation risk perception by increasing the complexity of the vegetation cover. The escape responses of three tropical birds with different diets and foraging strategies were also contrasted. There was no effect of habitat on FID, suggesting that birds in both habitats perceived predation risk in a similar manner. There was, however, a difference in FID among species: the Golden-cheeked Woodpecker tolerated closer human presence before flight than the Inca Dove and Streak-backed Oriole. This difference is likely due to the use of an alternative avoidance strategy of this species, which uses trunks for hiding.

Using anti-predator behaviors as proxies for perceived pressure is appealing because of the relative ease with which they can be recorded and the presumed relationship between the threat of interest and a predator stimulus. However, behaviors are plastic and affected by factors unrelated to human activity. Consequently, it is critical to assess the relationship between behavioral indicators and their context before interpretation. In this study we used a combination of behavior, movement and demography from a threatened population of African elephants in northern Kenya to determine whether reaction to research vehicles was indicative of poaching pressure. We used mixed-effects models predicting reaction of elephants to observer vehicle approaches in which we treated individuals as random effects and included ecological, anthropogenic, spatial, social and demographic predictor variables. Contrary to our hypothesis, recorded levels of reactive behavior did not increase with poaching levels in either a population-level dataset or a data subset of individuals whose spatial behavior was precisely known via radio-tracking. Rather, primary productivity positively predicted reactive behavior in both datasets. This relationship was heightened by the presence of musth males in the radio-collar dataset. Reactivity was not related to the time since entering the protected areas, but increased among groups that spent less time in the protected areas. Inter-individual differences were apparent, suggesting the importance of inherent differences (e.g. personality) across groups. In our study, elephants plagued by a severe human threat did not react defensively to humans in another context, suggesting nuanced discrimination of threats. Our study demonstrates the caution that should be taken in designing studies that use behavioral indices to represent threat and contributes to a growing body of literature employing behavioral indicators to monitor wildlife populations of conservation concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2017,20,3,,,,,215,224,,10.1111/acv.12309,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, few studies examining the response of deer to hunting have accounted for the localized nature of risk. To determine if white-tailed deer are able to recognize and respond to risks posed by hunters relative to specific hunting locations, we equipped 38 female white-tailed deer with GPS collars August-December 2013-2015. Deer were generally found to increase use of feeders, food plots, and vulnerability zones during crepuscular and nocturnal periods as the hunting season progressed. However, deer use of areas around hunting stands decreased during the middle of the day and increased at night in the days immediately following a stand being hunted. We detected no change in use of areas around hunting stands during crepuscular hours in days following when a stand was hunted. Our results suggest that female white-tailed deer are able to recognize and respond to localized risks and do so with a gradient of responses based on localized risk history.

Although MAOA deficiency is associated with reactive aggression in humans and mice, the involvement of this enzyme in defensive behaviour remains controversial and poorly understood. To address this issue, we tested MAOA knockout (KO) mice in a spectrum of paradigms and settings associated with variable degrees of threat. The presentation of novel inanimate objects induced a significant reduction in exploratory approaches and increase in defensive behaviours, such as tail-rattling, biting and digging. These neophobic responses were context-dependent and particularly marked in the home cage. In the elevated plus- and T-mazes, MAOA KO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates displayed equivalent locomotor activity and time in closed and open arms; however, MAOA KO mice featured significant reductions in risk assessment, as well as unconditioned avoidance and escape. No differences between genotypes were observed in the defensive withdrawal and emergence test. Conversely, MAOA KO mice exhibited a dramatic reduction of defensive and fear-related behaviours in the presence of predator-related cues, such as predator urine or an anaesthetized rat, in comparison with those observed in their WT littermates. The behavioural abnormalities in MAOA KO mice were not paralleled by overt alterations in sensory and microvibrissal functions. Collectively, these results suggest that MAOA deficiency leads to a general inability to appropriately assess contextual risk and attune defensive and emotional responses to environmental cues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2011,14,9,,,,,1195,1207,,10.1017/S1461145710001483,,,,,,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The ubiquitous presence of humans in urban areas selects for differential invasion by animals with short flight distances, and adaptation to urban environments results in further reductions in flight distance. Because prey are better able to cope with the proximity of humans than predators due to differences in flight distance, urban areas may act as refuges. Predators on average have a flight distance that is 8 times larger than that of their prey. In urban areas, humans were present within a distance of 54 m (the mean flight distance of raptor species) 16% of the time and 4% of the time within a distance of 7 m (the mean flight distance of prey species). In contrast, humans were present 1.2% of the time within a distance of 54 m but only 0.1% of the time within a distance of 7 m in rural habitats. Therefore, prey gained a 10-fold increase in predator refuge in urban compared with rural habitats. The reduction in flight distance between the ancestral rural and the current urban habitats decreased with the difference in flight distance between raptors and that of prey. The difference in flight distance between predators and that of prey increased with increasing preference of prey by sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus relative to their abundance, providing evidence of a selective advantage for prey. These results suggest that birds that are prey of raptors enjoy a selective advantage from association with humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP-OCT,2012,23,5,,,,,1030,1035,,10.1093/beheco/ars067,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance, however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human, meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in interspecific competition in other niche dimensions. Further research would benefit from using controlled experimental designs and investigating multiple dimensions of niche partitioning simultaneously. Finally, we recommend complementing the coefficient of temporal overlap with other metrics of fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,52,1,,,,,67,81,,10.1111/mam.12265,,JUL 2021,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Specifically, slower 'cognitive' fear responses towards distal threats involve a network of brain regions including the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while immediate 'reactive' fear responses rely on regions such as the periaqueductal grey(4,5). However, it is unclear how anxiety and its neural substrates relate to these distinct defensive survival circuits. We tested whether individual differences in trait anxiety would impact escape behaviour and neural responses to slow and fast attacking predators: conditions designed to evoke cognitive and reactive fear, respectively. Behaviourally, we found that trait anxiety was not related to escape decisions for fast threats, but individuals with higher trait anxiety escaped earlier during slow threats. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that when subjects faced slow threats, trait anxiety positively correlated with activity in the vHPC, mPFC, amygdala and insula. Furthermore, the strength of functional coupling between two components of the cognitive circuit-the vHPC and mPFC-was correlated with the degree of trait anxiety.

However, knowledge of how fire drives or mediates predator-prey interactions is fragmented and has not been synthesised. Here, we review and synthesise knowledge of how fire influences predator and prey behaviour and interactions. We develop a conceptual model based on predator-prey theory and empirical examples to address four key questions: (i) how and why do predators respond to fire; (ii) how and why does prey vulnerability change post-fire; (iii) what mechanisms do prey use to reduce predation risk post-fire; and (iv) what are the outcomes of predator-fire interactions for prey populations? We then discuss these findings in the context of wildlife conservation and ecosystem management before outlining priorities for future research. Fire-induced changes in vegetation structure, resource availability, and animal behaviour influence predator-prey encounter rates, the amount of time prey are vulnerable during an encounter, and the conditional probability of prey death given an encounter. How a predator responds to fire depends on fire characteristics (e.g. season, severity), their hunting behaviour (ambush or pursuit predator), movement behaviour, territoriality, and intra-guild dynamics. Prey species that rely on habitat structure for avoiding predation often experience increased predation rates and lower survival in recently burnt areas. By contrast, some prey species benefit from the opening up of habitat after fire because it makes it easier to detect predators and to modify their behaviour appropriately. Reduced prey body condition after fire can increase predation risk either through impaired ability to escape predators, or increased need to forage in risky areas due to being energetically stressed. To reduce risk of predation in the post-fire environment, prey may change their habitat use, increase sheltering behaviour, change their movement behaviour, or use camouflage through cryptic colouring and background matching. Field experiments and population viability modelling show instances where fire either amplifies or does not amplify the impacts of predators on prey populations, and vice versa. In some instances, intense and sustained post-fire predation may lead to local extinctions of prey populations. Human disruption of fire regimes is impacting faunal communities, with consequences for predator and prey behaviour and population dynamics. Key areas for future research include: capturing data continuously before, during and after fires; teasing out the relative importance of changes in visibility and shelter availability in different contexts; documenting changes in acoustic and olfactory cues for both predators and prey; addressing taxonomic and geographic biases in the literature; and predicting and testing how changes in fire-regime characteristics reshape predator-prey interactions. Understanding and managing the consequences for predator-prey communities will be critical for effective ecosystem management and species conservation in this era of global change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/brv.12853,,MAR 2022,,,,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Place learning through direct exposure to threat puts the individual at a risk that may be avoided, however, by remembering the location in which encounters between conspecifics and dangerous events are observed. Despite much theoretical work predicting that individuals should rely less on private information and more on public information as the risk of individual assessment increases, there have been no tests of observational spatial memory for potentially dangerous places. We investigated whether Indian mynahs learn about an area in which they observe another individual experience an aversive event, namely capture by a human. Experimental observers watched a human chase, catch and remove a conspecfic from a feeding site in which observers were accustomed to feeding. A control group watched a human perform the same capture gestures, but with no mynah present. Analysis of observer behaviour at the feeding site both before and after observational training revealed that experimental observers locomoted more after training than before, relative to control observers, suggesting that mynahs acquired a fear response after watching a predatory attack on a conspecific. It appears that, in addition to learning about the location in which aversive events are experienced directly, animals learn about an environment in which they observe others encounter dangerous events.

Fear's evolved function is motivating survival via defensive behaviours. Defensive behaviours have been highly conserved throughout mammalian species; hence much may be learned from ethology. Predation pressure drove the early evolution of defences, laying foundations in the more ancient brain structures. Conspecific (same species) pressure has been a more recent evolutionary influence, but along with environmental threats it has dominated PTSD research. Anti-predator responses involve both avoiding a predator's sensory field and avoiding detection if within it, as well as escape behaviours. More effective avoidance results in less need for escape behaviours, suggesting that avoidance is biologically distinct from flight. Recognizing the predation, environmental and conspecific origins of defence may result in clearer definition of PTSD phenomena. Defence can also be viewed in the stages of no threat, potential threat, encounter and circa strike. Specific defences are used sequentially and according to contexts, loosely in the order: avoidance, attentive immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defence, appeasement and tonic immobility. The DSM-IV criteria and PTSD research show substantial congruence with the model proposed: that PTSD is a disorder of heightened defence involving six key defences used in conjunction with vigilance and risk assessment according to contexts. Human research is reviewed in this respect with reference to laboratory and wild animal observations providing new insights. Understanding individual perceptual issues (e. g. predictability and controllability) relevant to these phenomena, combined with defence strategy recalibration and neuronal plasticity research goes some way to explaining why some traumatized individuals develop PTSD when others do not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,43,11,,,,,1038,1048,,10.3109/00048670903270407,,,,,,Psychiatry,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Numerous species require immediate conservation intervention. But our ability to identify species on the brink of decline, and to intervene successfully, depends on developing reliable leading indicators of population, community, and environmental change. Classic approaches, such as population and life history assessment, as well as indicator species, trail environmental change. Adaptive behaviors honed by natural selection to respond quickly to environmental changes represent true leading indicators that we can learn to apply to conservation and management. Excellent examples of useful behaviors for conservation include foraging behavior, patch use, and habitat selection. Comparisons among giving-up densities collected in artificial resource patches can effectively indicate the forager's predation costs, its habitat quality, mechanisms of coexistence, and environmental richness. Patterns of adaptive habitat use can similarly reveal the relative value of different types of habitat, the location, and amounts of source versus sink habitat in a landscape, the effects of human disturbance, and projections on future extinction risk. Each behavior is likely to change more quickly than population size. As useful as these and related indicators may be to managers and conservationists, similar behaviors can emerge from different causes, and immediate returns of behavior to fitness may cause rapid evolution of associated morphological and physiological traits.

Because urban animals often experience reduced predation risk compared to their rural counterparts, and because escape behavior is energetically costly, we expect that urban environments will select for increased tolerance to humans. Many studies have supported this expectation by demonstrating that urban birds have reduced flight initiation distance (FID = predator-prey distance when escape by the prey begins) than rural birds. Here, we advanced this approach and, for the first time, assessed how 32 species of birds, found in 92 paired urban-rural populations, along a 3,900 km latitudinal gradient across Europe, changed their predation risk assessment and escape strategy as a function of living in urban areas. We found that urban birds took longer than rural birds to be alerted to human approaches, and urban birds tolerated closer human approach than rural birds. While both rural and urban populations took longer to become aware of an approaching human as latitude increased, this behavioral change with latitude is more intense in urban birds (for a given unit of latitude, urban birds increased their pre-detection distance more than rural birds). We also found that as mean alert distance was shorter, urban birds escaped more quickly from approaching humans, but there was no such a relationship in rural populations. Although, both rural and urban populations tended to escape more quickly as latitude increased, urban birds delayed their escape more at low latitudes when compared with rural birds. These results suggest that urban birds in Europe live under lower predation risk than their rural counterparts. Furthermore, the patterns found in our study indicate that birds prioritize the reduction of on-going monitoring costs when predation risk is low.

This balance is particularly true for gallinaceous birds, such as the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), which are ground foragers and are often exposed to increased predation risk compared to arboreal foragers. We studied how bobwhites might mitigate the threat of human hunting pressure by altering their foraging strategy. We directly monitored hunting encounters with bobwhites, during October 2014-March 2015, and collected daily movement paths (n=514) using radio-telemetry. We performed first-passage time analysis to infer foraging behavior by calculating bout frequency, area, duration, and timing. We found bobwhites mitigated exposure to human hunters by increasing foraging frequency coupled with a decrease in duration (15.4%) and area (7.1%) in response to hunting pressure. We observed a temporal shift in foraging away from peak hunting hours by 30minutes when birds were recently exposed to a discharged firearm. Our results imply that hunting game species can disrupt timing of foraging and therefore influence allocation to competing activities such as anti-predator vigilance. We propose implementing a dynamic harvest management regime that distributes hunting activity temporally and spatially to mitigate high hunting pressure and reduce behavioral effects on bobwhites. Careful planning of hunting activity should reduce its additive effects on natural mortality while improving hunter satisfaction. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society. Northern bobwhites altered their foraging in response to increased levels of hunting pressure in an intensely managed landscape such that bobwhites increased the frequency of foraging but decreased the duration and area foraged. Our results imply that anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting pressure, can lead to disruption of time allocated to foraging; therefore, we suggest distributing the spatial and temporal concentration of hunting evenly throughout the hunting season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018,82,5,,,,,966,976,,10.1002/jwmg.21451,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

This variability is hypothesised to result from variation in the trade-offs associated with avoiding predators. But critical information on fitness outcomes of these trade-offs associated with anti-predator behaviours is lacking. We tested this trade-off hypothesis in Aedes aegypti, by examining oviposition site selection decisions in response towards larval predation risk and comprehensively measuring the fitness implications of trade-offs of avoiding larval predators, using three fitness measures: larval survival, development time and size. In a field study, we find that adult females show a surprisingly variable response to predators, ranging from attraction to avoidance. This variation is explained by fitness outcomes of oviposition along a predation-risk gradient that we measured in the laboratory. We show that ovipositing females could gain fitness benefits from ovipositing in pools with a low density of predators, rather than in predator-free pools, as predators provide a release from negative density effects of conspecific larvae that might co-occur in a pool. Interacting selection pressures may thus explain diverse prey responses. We suggest other systems in which similarly unexpected prey behaviour is likely to occur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,192,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1007/s00442-019-04552-4,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Because predators hunt using stealth and surprise, there is a widespread ability among prey to assess risk from chemical information - scents - in their environment. Consequently, scents often act as particularly strong modulators of memory and emotions. Recent advances in ecological research and analytical technology are leading to novel ways to use this chemical information to create effective attractants, repellents and anti-anxiolytic compounds for wildlife managers, conservation biologists and health practitioners. However, there is extensive variation in the design, results, and interpretation of studies of olfactory-based risk discrimination. To understand the highly variable literature in this area, we adopt a multi-disciplinary approach and synthesize the latest findings from neurobiology, chemical ecology, and ethology to propose a contemporary framework that accounts for such disparate factors as the time-limited stability of chemicals, highly canalized mechanisms that influence prey responses, and the context within which these scents are detected (e.g. availability of alternative resources, perceived shelter, and ambient physical parameters). This framework helps to account for the wide range of reported responses by prey to predator scents, and explains, paradoxically, how the same individual predator scent can be interpreted as either safe or dangerous to a prey animal depending on how, when and where the cue was deposited. We provide a hypothetical example to illustrate the most common factors that influence how a predator scent (from dingoes, Canis dingo) may both attract and repel the same target organism (kangaroos, Macropusspp.). This framework identifies the catalysts that enable dynamic scents, odours or odorants to be used as attractants as well as deterrents. Because effective scent tools often relate to traumatic memories (fear and/or anxiety) that cause future avoidance, this information may also guide the development of appeasement, enrichment and anti-anxiolytic compounds, and help explain the observed variation in post-traumatic-related behaviours (including post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) among diverse terrestrial taxa, including humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2018,93,1,,,,,98,114,,10.1111/brv.12334,,,,,,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The most impressive effect of toxoplasmosis is the fatal attraction phenomenon, the conversion of innate fear of cat odour into attraction to cat odour in infected rodents. While most behavioural effects of toxoplasmosis were confirmed also in humans, neither the fatal attraction phenomenon nor any toxoplasmosis-associated changes in olfactory functions have been searched for in them. Principal Findings: Thirty-four Toxoplasma-infected and 134 noninfected students rated the odour of urine samples from cat, horse, tiger, brown hyena and dog for intensity and pleasantness. The raters were blind to their infection status and identity of the samples. No signs of changed sensitivity of olfaction were observed. However, we found a strong, gender dependent effect of toxoplasmosis on the pleasantness attributed to cat urine odour (p = 0.0025). Infected men rated this odour as more pleasant than did the noninfected men, while infected women rated the same odour as less pleasant than did noninfected women. Toxoplasmosis did not affect how subjects rated the pleasantness of any other animal species' urine odour; however, a non-significant trend in the same directions was observed for hyena urine. Conclusions: The absence of the effects of toxoplasmosis on the odour pleasantness score attributed to large cats would suggest that the amino acid felinine could be responsible for the fatal attraction phenomenon. Our results also raise the possibility that the odour-specific threshold deficits observed in schizophrenia patients could be caused by increased prevalence of Toxoplasma-infected subjects in this population rather than by schizophrenia itself. The trend observed with the hyena urine sample suggests that this carnivore, and other representatives of the Feliformia suborder, should be studied for their possible role as definitive hosts in the life cycle of Toxoplasma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2011,5,11,,,,,,,e1389,10.1371/journal.pntd.0001389,,,,,,Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Thus, prey should be able to assess their own vulnerability to predation and modify their antipredatory behavior accordingly. When approached by predator skuas, unguarded penguin chicks flee short distances, and usually aggregate in dense packs, but there is a clear interindividual variability in their responses under similar conditions. We hypothesized that this variability in escape responses might be related to the perceived vulnerability to predation of each individual chick. We simulated predator attacks to chinstrap penguin chicks and analyzed the sources of variation in their escape response, such as the presence of adults or the density of other chicks, and the sex, age, body condition, and health status of responding chicks. Chicks allowed shorter approach distances when they had a better health condition (i.e., a greater T-cell-mediated immunity, CMI), when they were younger, and when the density of adults around was higher. Sex and density of other chicks were not important. Similarly, chicks fled from the experimenter to longer distances when they had a lower CMI and when the density of adults was lower. Therefore, escape characteristics of chicks depended on the presence of adults that can deter predators and on the health-dependent vulnerability of chicks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2006,60,6,,,,,778,784,,10.1007/s00265-006-0221-1,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

We tested the hypotheses that individual Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) vary consistently in their response to predators, a temperament trait, and that this individual variation is associated with breeding-site selection. Specifically, we tested whether measures of behavioral response to human approaches are associated with either patch area or patch openness and thus to area sensitivity. We made two to seven sequential approaches to Bobolinks in 2009 and 2010, measuring starting distance, flight-initiation distance, and the distance from the observers to where the birds landed. We analyzed the data with repeatability estimates and linear mixed modeling. Flight-initiation distance was repeatable when starting distance was controlled for, but distance to landing was not after starting distance and flight-initiation distance were controlled for. We found no strong effect of area or openness on either flight-initiation distance or distance to landing. We conclude that this measure of response to predators shows individual variation, but this variation does not explain patterns of settlement among habitat patches. Because flight-initiation distance is often used to identify distances at which human behavior disrupts wildlife, we estimate its mean (21.8 m) and the distance at which 75%, 95%, and 99% of the Bobolinks flushed (28, 40, and 59 m, respectively).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2012,114,1,,,,,212,218,,10.1525/cond.2012.110095,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The field of robotics has the potential to accelerate progress along this path, by offering unprecedented means for the design and development of accurate and reliable experimental stimuli. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, the integration of robotic predators in place conditioning experiments. We hypothesized zebrafish to be capable of forming a spatial association under a simulated predation risk. We repeatedly exposed experimental subjects to a robotic heron impacting the water surface and then evaluated their spatial avoidance within the experimental tank in a subsequent predator-free test session. To pharmacologically validate the paradigm, we tested zebrafish in drugfree conditions (control groups) or in response to three different concentrations of citalopram (30, 50, and 100 mg/L) and ethanol (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00%). Experimental data indicate that, when tested in the absence of the conditioning stimulus, zebrafish displayed a marked preference for the bottom of the test tank, that is, the farthest location from the simulated attacks by the robotic heron. This conditioned geotaxis was reduced by the administration of citalopram in a linear dose-response curve and ethanol at the low concentration. Ultimately, our data demonstrate that robotic stimuli may represent valid conditioning tools and, thereby, aid the field of zebrafish psychopharmacology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 27,2020,378,,,,,,,,112256,10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112256,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

In this study we compared the two aforementioned measures of risk reaction for the House sparrow and the Orange-breasted bunting, two bird species inhabiting the same urban areas, and assessed if they were related with sex, flock size, and environmental factors. We performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to explore the relationships between environmental factors and ADs and FIDs. Both behavioral responses were significantly lower for House sparrows. Although we did not find significant relationships between the assessed variables (sex, flock size, environmental factors) and bunting ADs and FIDs, we did find House sparrow males to be bolder (showing shorter ADs and FIDs), as well as larger ADs and FIDs for sparrows with increasing flock size. House sparrow ADs and FIDs were positively related with herbaceous plant cover and negatively related with minimum building height. In general, House sparrows showed to be bolder than Orange-breasted buntings, with differential responses of the sparrow related with sex, flock size, and different environmental factors. Having recorded bolder House sparrow males could be due to increases in aggressiveness related to the breeding season.

The present study evaluated the ability of 8-OH-DPAT (0.05-10 mg/kg, SC, 5) and gepirone (2.5-10 mg/kg, IP, 30), a full- and a partial agonist at 5-HT1A sites, as well as pirenperone (0.25-1 mg/kg, IP, 30), a preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, to exert an anxiolytic-like action in the MDTB. The most consistent effect of both 5-HT1A receptor agonists across tests was a marked reduction in predator assessment activity and defensive attack behavior. In contrast, neither of the two ligands was able to reduce flight responses to the approaching predator, and both failed to reduce in a specific manner contextual defense behaviors after the predator was removed. The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist pirenperone did not provide significant indication of an anxiolytic effect on predator assessment activity and postpredator potentiation of contextual defense responses, and had negligible influence on antipredator defensive behavior. The most interesting exception to this profile was a dose-related reduction in flight-related measures. In view of previous results indicating that the panic-promoting drug yohimbine increases flight/escape reactions and that the panicolytic compound alprazolam reduces these responses, we tentatively suggest that the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist pirenperone may have some efficacy in improving panic attacks. In addition, the lack of effect of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists on these flight responses is consistent with clinical findings indicating that these agents are of limited use in the treatment of panic disorder.

At present, we lack a coherent framework to predict the effects of large carnivores in these anthropogenic landscapes. We review how human actions influence the ecological roles of large carnivores by affecting their density or behaviour or those of mesopredators or prey species. We argue that the potential for density-mediated trophic cascades in anthropogenic landscapes is limited to unproductive areas where even low carnivore numbers may impact prey densities or to the limited parts of the landscape where carnivores are allowed to reach ecologically functional densities. The potential for behaviourally mediated trophic cascades may be larger and more widespread, because even low carnivore densities affect prey behaviour. We conclude that predator-prey interactions in anthropogenic landscapes will be highly context-dependent and human actions will often attenuate the ecological effects of large carnivores.

Modeling PTSD is challenging, as it is a heterogeneous disorder with >= 20 symptoms. Clinical research increasingly utilizes objective biological measures (e.g., imaging, peripheral biomarkers) or nonverbal behaviors and/or physiological responses to complement verbally reported symptoms. This shift toward more-objectively measurable phenotypes enables refinement of current animal models of PTSD, and it supports the incorporation of homologous measures across species. We reviewed.600 articles to examine the ability of current rodent models to probe biological phenotypes of PTSD (e.g., sleep disturbances, hippocampal and fear-circuit dysfunction, inflammation, glucocorticoid receptor hypersensitivity) in addition to behavioral phenotypes. Most models reliably produced enduring generalized anxiety-like or depression-like behaviors, as well as hyperactive fear circuits, glucocorticoid receptor hypersensitivity, and response to long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although a few paradigms probed fear conditioning/extinction or utilized peripheral immune, sleep, and noninvasive imaging measures, we argue that these should be incorporated more to enhance translation. Data on female subjects, on subjects at different ages across the life span, or on temporal trajectories of phenotypes after stress that can inform model validity and treatment study design are needed. Overall, preclinical (and clinical) PTSD researchers are increasingly incorporating homologous biological measures to assess markers of risk, response, and treatment outcome.

We asked whether elevation or latitude would explain more variation in the FID of a common passerine bird species, dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis). Juncos live in a variety of habitats along both latitudinal and elevational gradients. We found that statistical models containing elevation as a variable explained more of the variation in FID than did models containing latitude. We also found, unexpectedly, that birds at higher elevation fled at greater distances. While more predators were sighted per hour at higher elevations than at lower elevations, the frequency of predator sightings did not explain a significant amount of variation in FID. This result questions whether predator density is the main driver of risk perception along elevational gradients. Nonetheless, because elevation explains more variation in FID than latitude in at least one species, these findings have direct implications on how human impacts on birds are managed. Specifically, those designing set-back zones to reduce human impact on birds may consider modifying them based on both latitude and elevation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2020,66,3,,,,,239,245,,10.1093/cz/zoz046,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

To model the heterogeneity of PTSD behavioral responses, we exposed male Sprague-Dawley rats to predator scent stress once for 10 min and then assessed anxiety-like behavior 7 days later using the elevated plus maze and acoustic startle response. Rats displaying anxiety-like behavior in both tasks were classified as stress Susceptible, and rats exhibiting behavior no different from un-exposed Controls were classified as stress Resilient. In Resilient rats, we previously found increased mRNA expression of mGlu5 in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and CB1 in the amygdala. Here, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine the subregion and cell-type-specific expression of these genes in Resilient rats 3 weeks after TMT exposure. Resilient rats displayed increased mGlu5 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the PFC and increased BLA CB1 mRNA. These increases were limited to glutamatergic cells. To test the necessity of mGlu5 for attenuating TMT-conditioned contextual fear 3 weeks after TMT conditioning, intra-BLA infusions of the mGlu5 negative allosteric modulator MTEP were administered prior to context re-exposure. In TMT-exposed Resilient rats, but not Controls, MTEP increased freezing on the day of administration, which extinguished over two additional un-drugged sessions. These results suggest that increased mGlu5 expression in BLA glutamate neurons contributes to the behavioral flexibility observed in stress-Resilient animals by facilitating a capacity for extinguishing contextual fear associations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,226,7,,,,,2279,2293,,10.1007/s00429-021-02326-4,,JUN 2021,,,,Anatomy & Morphology; Neurosciences & Neurology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The issue studied was whether horses transformed by humans and placed in stable-pasture environments had retained their natural abilities to respond to predation risk. The objective of the study was to determine the changes in cardiac activity, cortisol concentrations, and behavior of horses in response to the vocalizations of two predators: the gray wolf (Canis lupus), which the horses of the breed studied had coevolved with but not been exposed to recently, and Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr), from which the horses had been mostly isolated. In addition, we hypothesized that a higher proportion of Thoroughbred (TB) horse ancestry in the pedigree would result in higher emotional excitability in response to predator vocalizations. Nineteen horses were divided into groups of 75%, 50% and 25% TB ancestry. The auditory test conducted in a paddock comprised a 10-min prestimulus period, a 5-min stimulus period when one of the predators was heard, and a 10-min poststimulus period without any experimental stimuli.ResultsThe increase in heart rate and saliva cortisol concentration in response to predator vocalizations indicated some level of stress in the horses. The lowered beat-to-beat intervals revealed a decrease in parasympathetic nervous system activity. The behavioral responses were less distinct than the physiological changes. The responses were more pronounced with leopard vocalizations than wolf vocalizations.ConclusionsThe horses responded with weak signs of anxiety when exposed to predator vocalizations. A tendency towards a stronger internal reaction to predators in horses with a higher proportion of TB genes suggested that the response intensity was partly innate. The more pronounced response to leopard than wolf may indicate that horses are more frightened of a threatening sound from an unknown predator than one known by their ancestors. The differing response can be also due to differences in the characteristic of the predators' vocalizations. Our findings suggested that the present-day horses' abilities to coexist with predators are weak. Hence, humans should protect horses against predation, especially when introducing them into seminatural locations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 10,2020,16,1,,,,,,,431,10.1186/s12917-020-02643-6,,,,,,Veterinary Sciences,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Consequently, numerous habitats will become less suitable for some species due to an increase in perceived risk of predation. Studies show that different species vary greatly in their tolerance to human disturbance, but these findings are typically only based on flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which animals flee when approached by a potential predator including a human). The aim of this study was to broaden the general view of escape behaviour by including distance fled (DF) in the analyses. We measured FID and DF in 699 birds belonging to 17 species in Estonian urban and rural settlements. We calculated the relationships between two types of escape decisions and behavioural, environmental and morphological parameters. There was a positive relationship between FID and DF for heavier species, but not for lighter species suggesting mass-dependent differences in the cost of escape. Flock size and starting distance in rural habitats were important predictors of FID while distance to refuge was only positively correlated with DF. Birds in rural habitats escaped earlier and further and exhibited a positive relationship between starting distance and FID, whereas no such trend was seen in urban birds, possibly due to a narrow zone of awareness. Our findings suggest that DF represents an independent and informative additional measure of antipredator behaviour that together with FID provides a more integrated view of the costs of escape. This, in turn, facilitates finding effective ways for mitigating effects of anthropogenic disturbance on wild animals. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

While numerous aspects of vigilance have been extensively studied, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the role of vigilance in escaping from predators. In a multispecies approach, we measured vigilance (as the proportion of time spent in a head-up posture) and three consecutive components of escape behaviour, predetection distance, assessment interval and flight initiation distance, of wild birds in urban and rural habitats in three European countries. Escape behaviour was induced by a human observer walking towards the focal bird whose vigilance was measured beforehand. More vigilant individuals did not detect predators earlier than less vigilant ones. In addition, more vigilant individuals spent more time on risk assessment and escaped later. Body mass was positively correlated with vigilance for birds on higher perches, where we expected vigilance to be less important. Finally, urban birds were more vigilant than rural birds, suggesting that distractions in urban habitats might have a more profound impact on vigilance than the expected lower predation risk. These results challenge the underlying assumption that more vigilant individuals have a higher perceived risk of predation and hence better odds at avoiding predation. We explain our results in the context that higher levels of vigilance compensate for environmental distractions and for innate deficiencies or lack of experience that constrain the detection of predators. We suggest that a re-examination of the basic functions and markers of vigilance is needed before using it as a measure of fearfulness in birds.

These aspects of escape behavior are consistent for individuals but also among sites, seasons, and years. Escape behavior expressed in response to a broad range of cuckoo hosts and prey are consistently used against capture by humans, but also hosts and brood parasites and predators and their prey. An interspecific comparative phylogenetic analysis of escape behavior by hosts and their brood parasites and prey and their predators revealed evidence of consistent behavior when encountering potential parasites or predators.

However, fitness-influencing behaviours, such as mating, can alter risk and influence predator-prey space-use dynamics. In tree crickets,Oecanthus henryi, mate searching involves acoustic signalling by immobile males and phonotactic movement by females. Space-use patterns in tree crickets relative to their primary predators, green lynx spiders (Peucetia viridans), should therefore depend on their current mate-searching state; whether males are calling or non-calling and whether females are phonotactic or non-phonotactic. We first measured the degree of spatial anchoring of crickets to specific bushes in the field and determined whether that influenced the probability of broad-scale spatial overlap with spiders. In the absence of spiders, all crickets, independent of sex or male calling status, were found to be spatially anchored to specific types of bushes and not uniformly distributed on the landscape. At the broad spatial scale, spiders were more likely to be found on bushes with female crickets and, to a lesser degree, calling male crickets. At a finer spatial scale within a bush, movement strategies of crickets not only varied depending on the presence or absence of a spider, but also on their current mate-searching state. Phonotactic females showed clear predator avoidance, whereas calling and non-calling males moved towards the spider instead of away, similar to predator inspection behaviour seen in many taxa. As the strongly selected sex, males are more likely to undertake risky mate-searching activities, which includes inspection of predator positions. Overall, we found that all crickets were predictably anchored at the landscape scale, but their sex and mate-seeking behaviour influenced the degree of overlap with predators and their antipredator movement strategies. Reproductive strategies within a prey species, therefore, can alter predator-prey space race at multiple spatial scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 30,2020,287,1935,,,,,,,20201462,10.1098/rspb.2020.1462,,,,,,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Recent studies indicate the consumptive effects of large reef predators are too diffuse to elicit trophic cascades. Here, we provide evidence that such predators can produce non-consumptive (fear) effects that flow through herbivores to shape the distribution of seaweed on a coral reef. This trophic cascade emerged because reef topography, tidal oscillations, and shark hunting behaviour interact to create predictable hot spots of fear on the reef where herbivores withhold feeding and seaweeds gain a spatial refuge. Thus, in risky habitats, sharks can exert strong ecological impacts even though they are trophic generalists that rarely feed. These findings contextualize the debate over whether predators influence coral reef structure and function and move us to ask not if, but under what specific conditions, they generate trophic cascades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 16,2017,7,,,,,,,,15684,10.1038/s41598-017-15679-w,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Developing relevant animal models whereby many variables can be efficiently controlled is thus essential to understanding this elusive relationship. Here, we use our repeated unpredictable stress (RUS) paradigm, in combination with our established mouse model of repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI), to assess the impact of repeated exposures to these paradigms on behavioral and neurobiological measures. C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to RUS and r-mTBI at 3 and 6 months of age followed by batteries of behavioral testing. Mice were euthanized 10 days and 3 months post-exposure, with brain and plasma samples collected for molecular profiling. The RUS paradigm involved exposure to a predator odor (trimethylthiazoline; TMT) while under restraint, daily unstable social housing, five inescapable footshocks on separate days, and chronic social isolation. Animals receiving r-mTBI ( x 5) and stress were exposed to a single closed-head injury 1 h after each footshock. Stress-alone mice showed significant weight loss, recall of traumatic memories, and anxiety-like and passive stress-coping behavior when compared with control mice. However, in stress+r-mTBI animals, the changes in cued fear memory, anxiety, and stress-coping tests were diminished, possibly due to TBI-induced hyperactivity. We also report complex brain molecular and neuropathological findings. Stress and r-mTBI, either individually or comorbidly, were associated with a chronic reduction in dendritic spine GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in the hippocampus. While stress augmented the r-mTBI-dependent astrogliosis in the corpus callosum, it mitigated r-mTBI-induced increases in hippocampal pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We anticipate that our model will be a good platform to untangle the complex comorbid pathophysiology in stress disorders and r-mTBI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1,2019,36,17,,,,,2590,2607,,10.1089/neu.2018.6314,,MAY 2019,,,,General & Internal Medicine; Neurosciences & Neurology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, in apparent contradiction with this well-established optimality model, birds and mammals generally initiate escape soon after beginning to monitor an approaching threat, a phenomena codified as the ``Flush Early and Avoid the Rush'' (FEAR) hypothesis. Typically, the FEAR hypothesis is tested using correlational statistics and is supported when there is a strong relationship between the distance at which an individual first responds behaviorally to an approaching predator (alert distance, AD), and its flight initiation distance (the distance at which it flees the approaching predator, FID). However, such correlational statistics are both inadequate to analyze relationships constrained by an envelope (such as that in the AD-FID relationship) and are sensitive to outliers with high leverage, which can lead one to erroneous conclusions. To overcome these statistical concerns we develop the phi index (W), a distribution-free metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of a 1: 1 relationship in a constraint envelope (the prediction of the FEAR hypothesis). Using both simulation and empirical data, we conclude that W is superior to traditional correlational analyses because it explicitly tests the FEAR prediction, is robust to outliers, and it controls for the disproportionate influence of observations from large predictor values (caused by the constrained envelope in AD-FID relationship). Importantly, by analyzing the empirical data we corroborate the strong effect that alertness has on flight as stated by the FEAR hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 18,2014,9,11,,,,,,,e113134,10.1371/journal.pone.0113134,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Our primary objective was to determine the relationship among coyote and deer spatial and temporal distribution, habitat characteristics, and human activity using multi-season patch occupancy models. Coyote occupancy was most strongly linked to rates of site visitation by humans and dogs, and was more likely farther from the urban center, with coyote colonization of sites inversely related to road density, housing density, and human and dog site visitation. Deer more frequently occupied sites with high canopy cover near water sources and colonized smaller sites with reduced housing density and human and dog presence. Expected predator-prey dynamics were altered in this highly urban system. Though we predicted deer would avoid coyotes on the landscape based on an ecology of fear framework, deer and coyote occupancy showed a strong positive association.

Although predator-prey interactions increasingly occur in habitats that experience multiple forms of human-generated disturbance, it is unclear how different forms of disturbance might affect antipredator behavior. Fire is a contemporary disturbance that has dramatic effects on terrestrial habitats. Such habitats may have also experienced past disturbances, like agricultural land use, that leave lasting legacies on habitat structure (e.g., overstory and understory composition). It is unclear how these past and present disturbances affect the use of different antipredator behaviors, like temporal avoidance and vigilance. We examined whether variation in disturbance regimes generates differences in ungulate antipredator behavior by using cameras to measure white-tailed deer vigilance and activity time across 24 longleaf pine woodlands that vary in past land use and contemporary fire regime. Regardless of land-use history, woodlands with high fire frequencies had 4 times less vegetation cover than low-fire woodlands, generating riskier habitats for deer; however, deer responded to fire with different antipredator strategies depending on land-use history. In nonagricultural woodlands, fire affected deer activity time such that activity was nocturnal in low-fire woodlands and crepuscular in high-fire woodlands. In post-agricultural woodlands, fire affected vigilance and not activity time such that deer were more vigilant in high-fire woodlands than in low-fire woodlands. These results suggest that ungulate antipredator behavior may vary spatially depending on past land use and contemporary fire regime, and such disturbances may generate landscapes of fear that persist for decades after agricultural use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP-OCT,2021,32,5,,,,,961,969,,10.1093/beheco/arab064,,JUL 2021,,,,Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The costs and benefits of neophobia may vary throughout the year if predation pressure, resource distribution or conspecific competition changes seasonally. Despite such variation, neophobia levels are often assumed to be temporally and individually stable. Whether or not neophobia expression changes seasonally and fluctuates equally for all individuals is crucial to understanding the drivers, consequences and plasticity of novelty avoidance. We investigated seasonal differences and individual consistency in the motivation and novelty responses of a captive group of rooks, Corvus frugilegus, a seasonally breeding, colonial species of corvid that is known for being neophobic. We tested the group around novel objects and novel people to determine whether responses generalized across novelty types, and considered whether differences in dominance could influence the social risk of approaching unknown stimuli. We found that the group's level of object neophobia was stable year-round, but individuals were not consistent between seasons, despite being consistent within seasons. In contrast, the group's avoidance of novel people decreased during the breeding season, and individuals were consistent year-round. Additionally, although subordinate birds were more likely to challenge dominants during the breeding season, this social risk taking did not translate to greater novelty approach. Since seasonal variation and individual consistency varied differently towards each novelty type, responses towards novel objects and people seem to be governed by different mechanisms. Such a degree of fluctuation has consequences for other individually consistent behaviours often measured within the nonhuman personality literature. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

A particularly promising approach is to apply predator scents to manipulate the cost/benefit ratio that influences the behavioral decisions made by prey and other predators about where to forage or rest. However, such olfactory manipulations are not always successful. Using insights from size-structured food webs, we develop a novel integrative model of the information that animals acquire from eavesdropping on predator and conspecific scents. We show how animals can use the information content in predator scents to derive knowledge of other predators and competitors and thus influence their decision to stay in or leave an area. This model framework clarifies how predator scents can influence all trophic levels, from interference competition directed at smaller predators, to predation and herbivory, and exploits direct and indirect pathways to promote landscapes of fear that influence spatial and temporal patch use in target animals. We illustrate how the application of this conceptual model can focus future research to enhance the use of predator scent-based deterrents in conservation and management.

Here, using the burrowing owl Athene cunicularia as a study model, we test whether changes in the behavioural profile of individuals and changes in conspecific density and predation pressure associated with urban life influence their breeding dispersal decisions compared to rural conspecifics. Our results show that breeding dispersal behaviour differs between rural and urban individuals. Site fidelity was lower among rural than among urban birds, and primarily related to an individual's behaviours (fear of humans), which has been reported to reflect individual personality. In contrast, the main determinant of site fidelity among urban owls was conspecific density. After taking the decision of dispersing, urban owls moved shorter distances than rural ones, with females dispersing farther than males. Our results support a personality-dependent dispersal pattern that might vary with predation risk. However, as multiple individuals of two populations (one urban, one rural) were used for this research, differences can thus also be caused by other factors differing between the two populations.

A recently developed mouse defense test battery (MDTB) has enabled description of mouse defensive behaviors to a predator, for comparison to those of rats, and a series of studies of drug effects on the behaviors measured in the MDTB provides evidence of doss-species generality of anxiolytic drug effects, or lack of effect, on specific defensive behaviors. In addition, tests with panicogenic and panicolytic drugs in the MDTB indicate that these enhance and reduce, respectively, flight reactions, which generally are not altered by anxiolytic compounds. Thus, results from the MDTB, taken in conjunction with those of the two rat test batteries and other defense analyses in rats and mice, provide evidence that many defensive behaviors are similar across rodent species, while the differences obtained provide a consistent pattern across situations. Moreover, the defense test batteries may be used to differentiate the effects of drugs effective against generalized anxiety as opposed to panic, through effects on specific defensive behaviors.

The exposition starts with models of classical conditioning dating from the early 1970s. Then it proceeds toward models of interactions between emotion and attention. Then models of emotional influences on decision making are reviewed, including some speculative (not and not yet simulated) models of the evolution of decision rules. Through the late 1980s, the neural networks developed to model emotional processes were mainly embodiments of significant functional principles motivated by psychological data. In the last two decades, network models of these processes have become much more detailed in their incorporation of known physiological properties of specific brain regions, while preserving many of the psychological principles from the earlier models. Most network models of emotional processes so far have dealt with positive and negative emotion in general, rather than specific emotions such as fear, joy, sadness, and anger. But a later section of this article reviews a few models relevant to specific emotions: one family of models of auditory fear conditioning in rats, and one model of induced pleasure enhancing creativity in humans. Then models of emotional disorders are reviewed. The article concludes with philosophical statements about the essential contributions of emotion to intelligent behavior and the importance of quantitative theories and models to the interdisciplinary enterprise of understanding the interactions of emotion, cognition, and behavior.

Theory predicts that spatial and temporal scales should co-vary in most ecological processes and that the most limiting factors should drive habitat selection at coarse ecological scales, but be less influential at finer scales. Using detailed location data on roe deer Capreolus capreolus inhabiting the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, we investigated habitat selection at several spatial and temporal scales. We tested 1) whether time-varying patterns were governed by factors reported as having the largest effects on fitness, 2) whether the trade-off between forage and predation risks differed among spatial and temporal scales and 3) if spatial and temporal scales are positively associated. We analysed the variation in habitat selection within the landscape and within home ranges at monthly intervals, with respect to land-cover type and proxys of food and cover over seasonal and diurnal temporal scales. The fine-scale temporal variation follows a nycthemeral cycle linked to diurnal variation in human disturbance. The large-scale variation matches seasonal plant phenology, suggesting food resources being a greater limiting factor than lynx predation risk. The trade-off between selection for food and cover was similar on seasonal and diurnal scale. Habitat selection at the different scales may be the consequence of the temporal variation and predictability of the limiting factors as much as its association with fitness. The landscape of fear might have less importance at the studied scale of habitat selection than generally accepted because of the predator hunting strategy. Finally, seasonal variation in habitat selection was similar at the large and small spatial scales, which may arise because of the marked philopatry of roe deer. The difference is supposed to be greater for wider ranging herbivores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2017,40,8,,,,,1014,1027,,10.1111/ecog.02152,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Among these behavioral changes, animals around humans often reduce their fearfulness and antipredator responses towards humans. A straightforward prediction is that habituation to humans associated with tourism would negatively influence reaction to predators. This could happen indirectly, where human presence decreases the number of natural predators and thus prey become less wary, or directly, where human-habituated individuals become bolder and thus more vulnerable to predation. Building on ideas from the study of traits associated with domestication and urbanization, we develop a framework to understand how behavioral changes associated with nature-based tourism can impact individual fitness, and thus the demographic trajectory of a population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2015,30,12,,,,,755,765,,10.1016/j.tree.2015.09.010,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

While behavioural and cognitive plasticity are two traits that should predict the ability of species to update the value of environmental cues, we argue that this flexibility may be constrained by ontogeny. While sensitive periods have been shown to exist for establishing an individual's food, habitat and mate preference, no studies have established the existence of a cognitive sensitive period for predation-related information. In this study, we used wood frogs, Lithobates sylvaticus, to demonstrate the existence of a sensitive period for predation-related information, with risk information learned as embryos maintained for more than 5 weeks, while the same information learned as tadpoles was unused after just 10 days. Next, we demonstrated that tadpoles that had learned a cue as safe as embryos were unable to update the cue as risky after three fear conditioning attempts, while tadpoles that learned the cue as safe a few days prior did successfully update the cue as risky after three conditionings. We coined the term cognitive resonance to describe how information learned early in life can have marked cognitive consequence later in life, affecting not only the duration for which information learned is actively used in decision-making, but how this information can interfere with the acquisition of up-to-date information about the environment. Cognitive resonance might be beneficial in stable environments where the change in the value of a cue is relatively small through time, but it can quickly become costly in environments where the identity of potential threats changes quickly, as in the case of introduced species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,33,4,,,,,703,711,,10.1111/1365-2435.13294,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Recently, however, interest has begun to focus on identifying personality traits in animals and examining their possible evolutionary consequences. One major axis used to define personality traits is the shyness-boldness continuum. We examined boldness in an in situ experiment using fish from eight populations of the poeciliid Brachyraphis episcopi (also referred to as Brachyrhaphis episcopi). Fish from high- and low-predation regions within four streams that run independently into the Panama Canal were tested. Boldness scores were strongly influenced by standard length and the relative level of predation pressure in the rivers. In all four rivers, fish from high-predation areas were bolder than those from low-predation areas. Fish became increasingly shy as they grew.

Animal models provide an opportunity to investigate the neural and developmental processes that underlie the relationship between early stress and later abnormal behavior. The present model used repeated exposure to 2,3,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT), a component of fox feces, as an unconditioned fear-eliciting stimulus in order to induce stress in juvenile rats aged postnatal day (PND) 23 through 27. After further physical maturation characteristic of the adolescent stage (PND 42), animals were tested using an elevated plus maze (EPM) for anxiety and plantar test (Hargreaves method) for pain to assess any lingering effects of the juvenile stress. To assess how an additional stress later in life affects anxiety and pain nociception, PND 43 rats were exposed to inescapable shock (0.8 mA) and again tested on EPM and plantar test. A final testing period was conducted in the adult (PND 63) rats to assess resulting changes in adult behaviors. TMT-exposed rats were significantly more anxious in adolescence than controls, but this difference disappeared after exposure to the secondary stressor. In adulthood, but not in adolescence, TMT-exposed rats demonstrated lower pain sensitivity than controls. These results suggest that early life stress can play a significant role in later anxiety and pain nociception, and offer insight into the development and manifestation of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders.

Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain how species manage living in heterogeneous and complex anthropogenic habitats. The ability of individuals or species to beneficially modify their behaviors in response to changes in the environment has indeed been alternatively explained based on phylogenetic, adaptive, and ontogenic arguments. In this study we investigated the role of sociality as a driver of behavioural flexibility in urban birds. Sociality can be defined as the tendency to associate with conspecifics or form a group and may influence a species' ability to survive in an urban ecosystem to the extent that it represents advantages to species or individuals in terms of resource exploitation, fitness, and predation risk-avoidance. Given the potential benefits of sociality we hypothesized that sociality is a further characteristic that may explain how species have successfully expanded their range into urbanized areas. Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that pigeons (Columba livia) will show higher behavioural flexibility when in larger groups, whatever their genetic background and living-circumstances. Using pigeons as a model system, we compared 27 groups in France and Italy composed of four different genetic strains and varying living-conditions: free-living feral pigeons in urban areas, free-living domestic pigeons at the property of a local breeder captive, feral pigeons in a French ecological field station, captive domestic pigeons in an Italian ecological station. We tested two standardized behavioral measures of behavioural flexibility: thresholds for fear or neophobia and rates of problem solving. We found that group number affects neophobia and to a lesser extent problem-solving, suggesting that sociality is a factor enhancing birds' faculties to establish in and cope with heterogeneous urban environments. We consider this hypothesis here as compatible and complementary to existing hypotheses on species' adaptation to urban ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2017,20,3,,,,,609,615,,10.1007/s11252-016-0618-1,,,,,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The habitat use of Pampas foxes did not vary between seasons, but their detectability was lower during the hunting season in habitats that allow humans to see foxes easily (i.e., habitats with high visibility). Pampas foxes selected dusk and night-time, increasing their activity at dusk hours on sites with hunting and showed differences in activity patterns related with the level of visibility of the habitat and to season.

The existence of this system may have important implications for policy making related to security. The system is sensitive to partial, uncertain cues of potential danger, detection of which activates a persistent, potent motivational state of wariness or anxiety. This state motivates behaviors to probe the potential danger, such as checking, and to correct for it, such as washing. Engagement in these behaviors serves as the terminating feedback for the activation of the system. Because security motivation theory makes predictions about what kinds of stimuli activate security motivation and what conditions terminate it, the theory may have applications both in understanding how policy makers can best influence others, such as the public, and also in understanding the behavior of policy-makers themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 9,2013,7,,,,,,,,556,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00556,,,,,,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Adaptive biases or predispositions constrain learning and reduce such potential costs. Preferential learning about complex biologically-meaningful stimuli such as predators, has been investigated in only a few systems and there have been no experimental tests for the presence of adaptive biases in a marsupial. We have previously shown that tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) became fearful of a model fox (Vulpes vulpes) after it was repeatedly paired with an aversive event. Tammars generalized their acquired response to a cat (Felis catus), but not to a non-predator (juvenile goat, Capra hircus), suggesting that they might have a bias to associate predators with frightening events. The present study tested this idea directly. We used an experimental design identical to that of earlier predator-training experiments, but substituted a model goat for the fox as the stimulus predicting a capture attempt. A control group had the same total experience of the goat and of a human with a net but without any predictive relationship between these two events. We detected no change in behaviour towards the goat, or to any of an array of control stimuli, as a consequence of training. This finding contrasts strongly with the effects of the same pairing procedure using a fox model. Taken together, these studies provide the first evidence for an adaptive predisposition to acquire a fear of predators in marsupials. Learning processes in this group are thus evolutionarily convergent with those previously described in eutherian mammals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2002,108,12,,,,,1103,1114,,10.1046/j.1439-0310.2002.00840.x,,,,,,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Flight initiation distance (FID) is the distance at which an individual animal takes flight when approached by a human, and hence, it reflects the life-history compromise between risk of predation and the benefits of foraging. Here, we analysed FID in 128 species of birds in relation to three measures of genetic variation, band sharing coefficient for minisatellites, observed heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient for microsatellites in order to test whether FID was positively correlated with genetic variation. We found consistently shorter FID for a given body size in the presence of high band sharing coefficients, low heterozygosity and high inbreeding coefficients in phylogenetic analyses after controlling statistically for potentially confounding variables. These findings imply that antipredator behaviour is related to genetic variance. We predict that many threatened species with low genetic variability will show reduced antipredator behaviour and that subsequent predator-induced reductions in abundance may contribute to unfavourable population trends for such species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,30,11,,,,,2059,2067,,10.1111/jeb.13175,,,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, cuckoo females are polymorphic: grey females are similar to sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus, while rufous females were assumed to mimic kestrels Falco tinnunculus. Previous evidence based on dummy experiments with grey females consistently showed that both hosts and non-hosts recognize this brood parasite by its yellow eye and barred underparts. However, these traits are absent in kestrels. Host responses also do not covary geographically with local abundance of supposed models (sparrowhawks/kestrels). These patterns cast doubts on the kestrel-mimicry hypothesis. Here, we show experimentally for the first time that small birds that are unsuitable as hosts indeed do not mistake rufous cuckoos for kestrels: both tree sparrows Passer montanus and house sparrows P.domesticus feared grey cuckoos (similarly to sparrowhawks and kestrels) but ignored rufous cuckoos (similarly to innocuous Eurasian collared doves Streptopelia decaocto). These results provide further support for the hawk-mimicry hypothesis, but reject the kestrel-mimicry hypothesis. Colour polymorphism in birds is determined genetically, follows simple Mendelian rules and affects only colour but not patterns. These facts and striking similarities between plumages of rufous females and cuckoo fledglings suggest that the rufous morph is simply a colour alternative to the grey morph, did not evolve to mimic kestrels and might have arisen through paedomorphic retention of juvenile plumage to adulthood (neoteny).

FID has been used to test life-history trade-offs related to anti-predatory behaviour and for conservation purposes such as to establish buffer zones to minimize human disturbance, given its species-specific consistency. Individual consistency in FID, however, has been largely overlooked. Here we show that, even after controlling for several confounding effects, this behaviour has a strong individual component (repeatability = 0.84-0.92) in a bird species, leaving a small margin for behavioural flexibility. We hypothesize that individuals may distribute themselves among breeding sites depending on their individual susceptibility to human disturbance. This habitat selection hypothesis merits further research, given its implications on both evolutionary and applied ecology research.

However, few studies are concerned about the impacts of human provisioning on bird behavior. In this study, we compared the foraging distance (FD) and flight initiation distance (FID) of the black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), a bird that is widely distributed in urban and rural areas in Kunming, China, under different artificial provisioning intensities. We also conducted a quantitative analysis of the relationship between artificial provisioning and behavioral changes in these birds. Our results showed that both the FD and FID of black-headed gulls in urban regions are significantly shorter than those in rural populations. Moreover, urban black-headed gulls exhibited a series of signs of domestication, such as actively approaching humans to beg for food and foraging when called or fed by humans, besides a reduction in FID. This suggests that provisioning by humans has caused black-headed gulls to be less fearful of humans and has reduced their defenses against predators. We recommend that bird feeding should be carefully and properly executed, and that the long-term effects of artificial provisioning on wild birds require further monitoring. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Whether the returning large carnivores will modify ungulate behavior and indirectly affect lower trophic levels, depends on the ability of ungulates to recognize risk based on past encounters and cues indicating carnivore presence. In two case studies, we tested, by means of camera trapping, the behavioral response of deer to wolf urine. The first case study was in the Netherlands where deer (still) live in absence of wolves, and the second in Poland with long-term wolf presence. As controls we used water (no scent) and all-purpose soap (unfamiliar scent). Deer vigilance level on control plots was 20% in both case studies indicating that wolf occupancy per se does not lead to a consistent difference in behavior. Placing wolf urine did not significantly affect deer behavior in either the wolf-absent or the wolf-present area. More intense cues, or a combination of cues, are likely needed to affect deer behavior. Moreover, we found an unexpected reaction of deer towards all-purpose soap of reduced foraging (and tendency for increased vigilance) in the wolf-present area, whereas it did not affect deer behavior in the wolf-absent area. We hypothesize that deer associate all-purpose soap with human presence, causing no response in human-dominated landscapes (the Netherlands), but triggering a behavioral reaction in more remote areas (Poland). This illustrates attention should be paid to controls used in scent experiments as they may be associated differently than intended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 27,2019,14,11,,,,,,,e0223248,10.1371/journal.pone.0223248,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) are currently unknown. Increased perceived risk of predation by bobwhite during rabbit hunting events may elicit antipredator responses among bobwhite that impact fitness via changes in behavior that ultimately impact population growth. We estimated the nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on bobwhite behavior using telemetry across varying rabbit hunting intensities. Movements were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical modeling with a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to determine the effect of rabbit hunting on bobwhite. We observed an overall reduction in bobwhite movement in the presence of rabbit hunting, with a 38% (Posterior Overlap = 0.01) increase in bobwhite step length in the absence of rabbit hunting. We also observed bobwhite maintaining closer proximity to hardwood and escape cover under high rabbit hunting intensity, with a 59% (Posterior Overlap = 0.03) increase in distance from hardwood and a 28% (Posterior Overlap = 0.14) increase in distance from escape cover when rabbit hunting was removed. Synthesis and applications. Heightened antipredator behavior through decreased movement may assist with bobwhite predator avoidance. However, decreased movement and increased use of poor habitats may also have negative effects as a result of reduced foraging time or increased susceptibility to other predators. Future research should attempt to quantify the effect of decreased movement on bobwhite fitness through the evaluation of foraging time and survival in order to continue to improve management efforts for the species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,9,16,,,,,9324,9333,,10.1002/ece3.5479,,JUL 2019,,,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Here, we tested whether common European birds changed their flight initiation distances (FIDs) in response to vehicles according to road speed limit (a known factor affecting killing rates on roads) and vehicle speed. We found that FID increased with speed limit, although vehicle speed had no effect. This suggests that birds adjust their flight distance to speed limit, which may reduce collision risks and decrease mortality maximizing the time allocated to foraging behaviours.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the signal can enhance survivorship by leading pursuing predators into assuming the flasher is also conspicuous at rest. Naturally, this illusion will work best if potential predators are ignorant of the flasher's resting appearance, which could be achieved if the prey flees while the predator is relatively far away. To test this hypothesis, we compared the survival of flashing and non-flashing computer-generated prey with different flight initiation distances (FIDs) using humans as model predators. This experiment found that flash displays confer a survivorship advantage only to those prey with a long FID. A complementary phylogenetic analysis of Australian bird species supports these results: after controlling for body size, species with putative flashing signals had longer FIDs than those without. Species with putative flashing signals also tended to be larger, as demonstrated in other taxa. The anti-predation benefit of flash displays is therefore related to the nature of escape behaviour. Since birds with hidden signals tend to flee at a distance, the flash display here is unlikely to function by startling would-be predators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 28,2021,288,1955,,,,,,,20210866,10.1098/rspb.2021.0866,,,,,,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

A person approached juncos simultaneously playing the sounds of object types that normally move at different relative velocities: faster (bicycles), intermediate (skateboards and scooters), or slower (people walking). Juncos responded at significantly greater distances and moved further in relation to what sound cues would normally imply about the velocity of approach. Absolute stimulus volume was not a significant predictor of response across object type. The responses occurred without the presence of visual cues, suggesting that an auditory cue alone and without visual confirmation can produce an appropriate response.

Habitat structure influences visibility, which influences both the ability of prey to detect and respond to their predators. We studied how habitat visibility influenced time allocation and escape decisions of crimson rosellas ( Playcercus elegans). We examined the effect of visibility on time allocated to looking, locomotion and foraging. We measured escape decisions by experimentally approaching rosellas until they fled. We measured visibility by standing 12 m away from a 1-m(2) white sheet containing 36 points and counting the number of points that were visible. As measured, visibility influenced time allocated to both foraging and locomotion. However, there was no effect of visibility on flight-initiation distance or two other related measures of escape ( a measure of the latency to detect an approaching threat or the latency to flee once the threat was detected). Therefore, crimson rosellas modified their behaviour as a function of visibility, but this did not influence their decision to flee from an approaching human. We infer that they are sensitive to variation in visibility, but that this does not influence their overall perception of risk as we measured it. These two stages of antipredator behaviour may thus be largely independent; ubiquitous factors need not have ubiquitous effects on different aspects of antipredator behaviour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2006,54,5,,,,,363,367,,10.1071/ZO05080,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

The addition of noise induced only mild fear-related behaviours - there was an increase in startle responses, but no change in the time spent freezing or hiding compared to a silent control - and thus had no significant impact on the total amount of food eaten. However, there was strong evidence that the addition of noise increased food-handling errors and reduced discrimination between food and non-food items, results that are consistent with a shift in attention. Consequently, noise resulted in decreased foraging efficiency, with more attacks needed to consume the same number of prey items.

Analyses of 14 DNA microsatellite loci revealed a dichotomous main genetic structure reflecting their native origin, with the Rondane reindeer genetically different from the others and with least differentiation towards the Hardangervidda reindeer. The genetic clustering of the reindeer in Norefjell-Reinsjofjell, Ottadalen and Forollhogna, together with domestic reindeer, supports a predominant domestic origin of these herds. Despite extensive hunting in all herds, the behavioural measures indicate increasing vigilance, alert and flight responses with increasing genetic dissimilarity with domestic herds. Vigilance frequency and time spent vigilant were higher in Rondane compared to Hardangervidda, which again were higher than herds with a domestic origin.

Our objective was to determine whether large deer populations in the absence of a top-level carnivore were suppressing tree regeneration. As human visitation increased in the early 1900s and cougar became increasingly scarce, the mule deer population irrupted in the 1920s. In August 2006, we undertook a retrospective study of black oak recruitment (i.e., growth of seedling/sprouts into tall saplings and trees) by inventorying all black oaks in stands accessible to deer and greater than 0.5 ha in size (18 stands, 2921 trees). We similarly inventoried oaks within sites representing refugia from deer browsing (4 stands, 481 trees). While significantly diminished oak recruitment has occurred since the 1920s in stands accessible to deer (p < 0.01), continuous recruitment of oaks was found in refugia sites. We also found less oak recruitment in areas of high human activity near the park's visitor center (p < 0.01), possibly due to behaviorally-mediated effects of lower cougar and higher deer densities. overall our results are consistent with trophic cascade theory involving large predators, herbivores, and plants. The long-term lack of oak recruitment is also an indicator of a probable loss of biodiversity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

There is no agreement on just how to weigh the concern for welfare of fish against the human interests involved, but ethical frameworks exist that suggest how this might be approached. Different definitions of animal welfare focus on an animal's condition, on its subjective experience of that condition and/or on whether it can lead a natural life. These provide different, legitimate, perspectives, but the approach taken in this paper is to focus on welfare as the absence of suffering. An unresolved and controversial issue in discussions about animal welfare is whether non-human animals exposed to adverse experiences such as physical injury or confinement experience what humans would call suffering. The neocortex, which in humans is an important part of the neural mechanism that generates the subjective experience of suffering, is lacking in fish and non-mammalian animals, and it has been argued that its absence in fish indicates that fish cannot suffer. A strong alternative view, however, is that complex animals with sophisticated behaviour, such as fish, probably have the capacity for suffering, though this may be different in degree and kind from the human experience of this state. Recent empirical studies support this view and show that painful stimuli are, at least, strongly aversive to fish. Consequently, injury or experience of other harmful conditions is a cause for concern in terms of welfare of individual fish. There is also growing evidence that fish can experience fear-like states and that they avoid situations in which they have experienced adverse conditions. Human activities that potentially compromise fish welfare include anthropogenic changes to the environment, commercial fisheries, recreational angling, aquaculture, ornamental fish keeping and scientific research. The resulting harm to fish welfare is a cost that must be minimized and weighed against the benefits of the activity concerned. Wild fish naturally experience a variety of adverse conditions, from attack by predators or conspecifics to starvation or exposure to poor environmental conditions. This does not make it acceptable for humans to impose such conditions on fish, but it does suggest that fish will have mechanisms to cope with these conditions and reminds us that pain responses are in some cases adaptive (for example, suppressing feeding when injured). In common with all vertebrates, fish respond to environmental challenges with a series of adaptive neuro-endocrine adjustments that are collectively termed the stress response. These in turn induce reversible metabolic and behavioural changes that make the fish better able to overcome or avoid the challenge and are undoubtedly beneficial, in the short-term at least. In contrast, prolonged activation of the stress response is damaging and leads to immuno-suppression, reduced growth and reproductive dysfunction. Indicators associated with the response to chronic stress (physiological endpoints, disease status and behaviour) provide a potential source of information on the welfare status of a fish. The most reliable assessment of well-being will be obtained by examining a range of informative measures and statistical techniques are available that enable several such measures to be combined objectively. A growing body of evidence tells us that many human activities can harm fish welfare, but that the effects depend on the species and life-history stage concerned and are also context-dependent. For example, in aquaculture, adverse effects related to stocking density may be eliminated if good water quality is maintained. At low densities, bad water quality may be less likely to arise whereas social interactions may cause greater welfare problems. A number of key differences between fish and birds and mammals have important implications for their welfare. Fish do not need to fuel a high body temperature, so the effects of food deprivation on welfare are not so marked. For species that live naturally in large shoals, low rather than high densities may be harmful. On the other hand, fish are in intimate contact with their environment through the huge surface area of their gills, so they are vulnerable to poor water quality and water borne pollutants. Extrapolation between taxa is dangerous and general frameworks for ensuring welfare in other vertebrate animals need to be modified before they can be usefully applied to fish. The scientific study of fish welfare is at an early stage compared with work on other vertebrates and a great deal of what we need to know is yet to be discovered. It is clearly the case that fish, though different from birds and mammals, however, are sophisticated animals, far removed from unfeeling creatures with a 15 s memory of popular misconception. A heightened appreciation of these points in those who exploit fish and in those who seek to protect them would go a long way towards improving fish welfare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2006,68,2,,,,,332,372,,10.1111/j.0022-1112.2006.001046.x,,,,,,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Unlike natural habitats, birds in urban environments are exposed to an increased human presence which often induces stress. Urban birds with reduced sensitivity to human disturbance can obtain benefits such as longer foraging time or decreased energy costs for escape. Here, I tested the hypothesis that the decrease in flight initiation distance (FID) to a potential predator (an approaching human) reflects adaptation to the level of disturbance expressed as pedestrian density. Moreover, I studied the influence of habitat type and species on observed FIDs. I analysed 2117 flight distances (20 species of European birds) located in ten localities in Prague. I found that species and pedestrian density play a more important role in determining FIDs than the type of habitat. Moreover, urban populations exposed to increased pedestrian density had consistently shorter flight distances. This study provides empirical documentation of changes in anti-predator behaviour, which strongly correlate with the pedestrian density gradient. It could support the idea that the establishment of FID can be highly plastic process depending on local conditions, as it is highly affected by a bird's individuality and its ability to adapt to the local level of disturbance by learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SPR,2014,102,1,,,,,53,60,,10.5253/078.102.0105,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Toxoplasma gondii; Up to 43% of the French population may be infected, depending on eating habits and exposure Schizophrenia; to cats, and almost one third of the world human's population may be infected. Two types of Obsessive compulsive infection have been described: a congenital form and an acquired form. Although the medical disorder; profession treats these latent cases as asymptomatic and clinically unimportant, results of animal studies and recent studies of personality profiles, behavior, and psychomotor performance Personality have led to reconsider this assumption. Preclinical data. - Among rats: parasite cysts are more abundant in amygdalar structures than those found in other regions of the brain. Infection does not influence locomotion, anxiety, hippocampal-dependent learning, fear conditioning (or its extinction) and neophobia in rats. Rats' natural predator is the cat, which is also T. gondii's reservoir. Naturally, rats have an aversion to cat urine, but the parasite suppresses this aversion in rats, thus influencing the infection cycle. Tachyzoites may invade different types of nervous cells, such as neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells in the brain, and Purkinje cells in cerebellum. Intracellular tachyzoites manipulate several signs for transduction mechanisms involved in apoptosis, antimicrobial effectors functions, and immune cell maturation. Dopamine levels are 14% higher in mice with chronic infections. These neurochemical changes may be factors contributing to mental and motor abnormalities that accompany or follow toxoplasmosis in rodents and possibly in humans. Moreover, the antipsychotic haloperidol and the mood stabilizer valproic acid most effectively inhibit Toxoplasma growth in vitro with synergistic activity. Clinical data. - The effects of the parasite are not due to the manipulation in an evolutionary sense but merely due to neuropathological or neuroimmunological effects of the parasite's presence. Toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia: epidemiological studies point to a role for toxoplasmosis in schizophrenia's etiology, probably during pregnancy and early life, this association being congruent with studies in animal models indicating that animal exposures of the developing brain to infectious agents or immune modulating agents can be associated with behavioral changes that do not appear until the animal reaches full maturity. Psychiatric patients have increased rates of toxoplasmic antibodies, the differences between cases and controls being greatest in individuals who are assayed near the time of the onset of their symptoms. The increase of dopamine in the brain of infected subjects can represent the missing link between toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia. Toxoplasmosis and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD): the seropositivity rate for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies among OCD patients is found to be significantly higher than the rate in healthy volunteers. Infection of basal ganglia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of OCD among Toxoplasma seropositive subjects. Toxoplasmosis and personality: infected men appear to be more dogmatic, less confident, more jealous, more cautious, less impulsive and more orderly than others. Conversely, infected women seem warmest, more conscientious, more insecure, more sanctimonious and more persistent than others. It is possible that differences in the level of testosterone may be responsible for the observed behavioral differences between Toxoplasma-infected and Toxoplasma-free subjects. Conclusion. - In the future two major avenues for research seem essential. On one hand, prospective studies and research efforts must still be carried out to understand the mechanisms by which the parasite induces these psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, it has not yet been demonstrated that patients with positive toxoplasmic serology may better respond to haloperidol's or valproic acid's antiparasitic activity. These results may appear as a major issue in the drug's prescribing choices and explain variability in response to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that is not explained by the genetic polymorphism.

Flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which animals flee from an approaching threat) is often used to measure antipredator behaviour and establish buffer zones to reduce human impact on wildlife. In this study, we approached 10 waterbird species on larger lakes and narrower rivers using a motorboat. We investigated whether water body type, season (winter/spring), approach starting distance, species body mass, and group size influenced bird FID. Average bird FID was 145 +/- 92 m and differed between species. In general, FID of all species was larger on lakes than rivers and increased with increasing group size and approach starting distance. When analysed separately for the two most common species, common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), FID increased with increasing starting distance on rivers, but not lakes, likely because birds on lakes have enough time to evaluate the approaching object and take flight at great distance. Additionally, birds might perform different activities on lakes versus rivers, leading to varying energetic trade-offs between the two habitat types, which may affect the decision when to take flight. Finally, mallards aggregated in larger groups on lakes, which affected FID, likely due to enhanced visibility (i.e., earlier detection of the approaching boat) and detection probability (via increased group size) on lakes. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for habitat characteristics, such as water body type, when studying waterbird FID, because they can affect the visibility of stimuli, group size and potentially animal behaviour, factors which should be taken into account when planning buffer zones for waterbirds in conservation areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 16,2019,14,7,,,,,,,e0219845,10.1371/journal.pone.0219845,,,,,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Although the hippocampus has provided the gateway for understanding stress effects on the brain, less is known about the amygdala, a key brain area involved in the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety. Here, in mice more vulnerable to stressors, we demonstrate structural plasticity within the medial and basolateral regions of the amygdala in response to prolonged 21-day chronic restraint stress (CRS). Three days before the end of CRS, treatment with the putative, rapidly acting antidepressant, acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) in the drinking water opposed the direction of these changes. Behaviorally, the LAC treatment during the last part of CRS enhanced resilience, opposing the effects of CRS, as shown by an increased social interaction and reduced passive behavior in a forced swim test. Furthermore, CRS mice treated with LAC show resilience of the CRS-induced structural remodeling of medial amygdala (MeA) stellate neurons. Within the basolateral amygdala (BLA), LAC did not reduce, but slightly enhanced, the CRS-increased length and number of intersections of pyramidal neurons. No structural changes were observed in MeA bipolar neurons, BLA stellate neurons or in lateral amygdala stellate neurons. Our findings identify MeA stellate neurons as an important component in the responses to stress and LAC action and show that LAC can promote structural plasticity of the MeA. This may be useful as a model for increasing resilience to stressors in at-risk populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2017,22,2,,,,,227,234,,10.1038/mp.2016.68,,,,,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

It can be advantageous for an animal to secure access to habitat heterogeneity at a broader scale in order to be able to dynamically adjust finer scale habitat use through time. We tested the hypothesis of a forage-safety trade-off optimization tactic in a hunted red deer (Cervus elaphus) population following a large accidental forest fire. We used telemetry data and fitted resource selection functions at the second- and third-order scales. We then integrated the order-specific probabilities into single, all-in-one multi-level layers that synthetically captured the habitat selection patterns across scales by informing landscape-scale annual habitat selectivity with finer within-home-range seasonal and diel processes. At the landscape scale, red deer anchored their home-range at the interface of the disturbed and undisturbed patches, thereby securing habitat heterogeneity. This consequently enabled them to modulate within-home-range habitat selection depending on the season and the time of the day. In both seasons, red deer consistently used the burnt area for cover more during the day, and foraged in the unburnt forest and open fields at night. Interestingly there were no major seasonal differences in this diel habitat selection patterns. Increased mortality risk during the hunting season did not substantially change their spatial behaviour. We conclude that year-round avoidance of non-lethal human disturbance is the main driver of red deer habitat use in this system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2019,308,2,,,,,111,120,,10.1111/jzo.12657,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

Animals that employ temporal mechanisms use predator speed to gauge threat. In contrast, those that use spatial mechanisms use the distance to the predator as an indication of danger. Traditionally, this was viewed as a fixed distance. Recently, a new type of spatial mechanism was proposed that focused on animals initiating flight at a fixed ratio of the distance at which they first responded to the threat. Our study investigated the consistency of this slope among three species: the Eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), the Australian wood duck (Chenonetta jubata), and the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen). We found that these species exhibited statistically indistinguishable slopes from each other and the 0.44 slope that was initially reported in another species.

This study aimed to develop and apply a theory-based approach to identify stress responses among sheep farmers in the Swedish wolf-region. A thematic analysis of interviews conducted with sheep farmers showed ample support for stress responses among the informants in relation to large carnivores and their management, although the interviews were conducted with a different focal topic.

We randomly established a total of 12 permanent walking transects with the aid of a GPS device across three major habitat types used by the mountain nyala (i.e. four transects in each habitat). Following each transect, we conducted focal-animal observations to quantify the time-budget allocated to vigilance, feeding and moving. A total of 119 and 116 focal-animals were assessed in the wet and dry season respectively. Moreover, along each transect, seven habitat variables were collected in systematically laid 109 circular plots each with a 5-m radius (i.e. 31, 41 and 37 plots in the cleared vegetation, plantation and natural forest respectively) in the wet and dry season. We developed behavioural models by correlating the time-budget (i.e. proportion of time vigilance, feeding and moving) of the focal-animals in accordance with habitat variables, group-size and sex-age class. In the wet season, mountain nyala devoted most of their time to vigilance, but they allocated the largest proportion of their time to moving in the dry season. Vigilance differed among the three habitats and was highest in the cleared vegetation during the dry season. Contrary to expectations, adult males were more vigilant than both adult females and sub-adults during the dry season.

This study conducted online focus groups with 44 parents of LGBTQ adolescents in order to describe the factors influencing effective sexual health communication and parental monitoring in this population. Parents described generally positive relationships with teens, but many noted they went through a transition process in which they struggled with their child's identity and were less supportive of their LGBTQ teen. Lack of understanding about LGBTQ-specific sexuality was a commonly endorsed barrier to effective communication, and this was most commonly endorsed by parents of cisgender girls.

An animal's anti-predation ability is usually estimated by measuring its flight initiation distance (FID). FIDs in birds are affected by multiple factors including the color of the observer's clothing. The species confidence hypothesis argues that birds are attracted to colors which are the same as or similar to that of their own feathers and repelled by dissimilar colors. So far, there have been no studies on urban vs. rural differences in avian FIDs in response to different colored clothing. In this study, avian escape responses to observers wearing clothing of different colors with red (a bright color), black (dark color contrast), white (bright color contrast) and dark green (a concealment color) in urban (tropical Haikou city) and rural (Dongzhaigang Nature Reserve) populations were examined. Our results showed that urban avian FIDs were significantly shorter than rural avian FIDs. The colors of the observers' clothing did not have a significant impact on urban avian FIDs. However, rural birds had significantly longer FIDs for observers in red than the other three colors, which impacted them negligibly. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report urban vs. rural differences in avian responses to the colors of observers' clothing. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Preweaning 14-day-old mts became immobile and analgesic when exposed to the male and showed immobility but not analgesia when exposed to cat odor On Day 26, around weaning, the presence of the male rat no longer induced immobility and analgesia whereas cat odor produced higher levels of immobility and analgesia compared to control and male-exposed animals.

I hypothesized that in an area where crows are shot they would become more sensitive to human disturbance than those in an area where they are trapped. I compared alert and flight initiation distances of crows in two nearby, but separate, areas in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, in March 2004. In 2003 all 1,025 crows culled in the Daito area were shot, whereas 95.3% of 1,586 crows culled in the Tono area were trapped. Topography, land use, and human population densities were similar in the two areas. Analyses using generalized linear models showed that the area (and hence the method of culling) was the sole explanatory variable in the best model and included in each of the top five models for both distance measures. The median alert distance and flight initiation distance were greater where crows were shot than where they were trapped (60.0 m vs. 20.5 m and 46.0 m vs. 18.0 m, respectively). Other factors, such as species, flock size, behaviour, and habitat type, were far less important. These results show that shooting has a greater non-lethal effect on crows than trapping. While trapping may be a more efficient way of removing crows than shooting, shooting not only reduces the number of nuisance animals directly, but also affects their behaviour and habitat use so that damage is reduced indirectly. Shooting is thus the more effective choice for culling in order to reduce damage caused by crows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2020,19,2,,,,,125,134,,10.2326/osj.19.125,,,,,,Zoology,,,,,,,2022-04-02,

However, if laboratory rats can detect the vapor of PG and if exposure to this influences behaviors, such effects might confound data obtained from experiments exposing conscious rats to odorants dissolved in PG. Therefore, we examined this issue using differences in the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) as an index. We also conducted a habituation/dishabituation test to assess the ability of rats to detect the vapor of PG. In addition, we observed Ca2+ responses of vomeronasal neurons (VNs) in rats exposed to PG using the confocal Ca2+-imaging approach. Pure PG vapor significantly enhanced the ASR at a dose of 1 x 10(-4) M, which was much lower than the dose for efficiently detecting. In Ca2+ imaging, VNs were activated by PG at a dose of 1 x 10(-4) M or lower. These results suggest that PG vapor acts as an aversive stimulus to rats at very low doses, even lower than those required for its detection, indicating that we should consider such effect of PG when it is employed as a solvent for odorants in studies using conscious rats.
