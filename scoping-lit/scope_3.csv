Now recognized as a non-consumptive effect, the ecological and evolutionary impact of fear has been studied in a number of predator-prey systems within the last few decades. However, comparatively little consideration has been given to the non-consumptive effects that parasites have on their hosts, which have evolved behaviors to avoid parasites, impacting habitat selection, mate choice, and foraging activity. These avoidance behaviors create a landscape of disgust, wherein hosts navigate to avoid parasites, akin to the landscape of fear in prey. Evolutionarily speaking, however, predators and parasites are but two examples of natural enemies. Pathogens, parasites, predators, and parasitoids, among others, each exert their own fitness cost on the victims they attack. Since animals likely evolve in the presence of multiple natural enemies, they must adopt a range of avoidance behaviors to navigate through the resulting landscape of peril. Therefore, in line with recent efforts to combine the landscapes of fear and disgust, we offer a theoretical framework to better understand the impacts of natural enemies on the evolution of trait-mediated avoidance behaviors in animals. More precisely, we look at how victims may evolve to allocate energy optimally among distinct avoidance behaviors under the selective pressures imposed by different types of natural enemy. This framework is then put into the more realistic context of a food web, which highlights the impact of trophic interactions and trophic level on the evolution of avoidance behaviors.","[Doherty, Jean-Francois; Ruehle, Brandon] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand",,"Doherty, JF (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand.",jeff-doherty@hotmail.com,"Doherty, Jean-François/ABG-5939-2020","Doherty, Jean-François/0000-0003-4766-9417",University of Otago; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [PGSD3-530445-2019],This work was supported by the University of Otago Doctoral Scholarships to the authors and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) scholarship (PGSD3-530445-2019) to J-FD.,,47,6,6,9,22,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Fear of humans has been proposed to act as a substitute, but new research identifies humans as a super predator globally far more lethal to mesocarnivores, and thus presumably far more frightening. Although much of the world now consists of human-dominated landscapes, there remains relatively little research regarding how behavioral responses to humans affect trophic networks, to the extent that no study has yet experimentally tested the relative fearfulness mesocarnivores demonstrate in reaction to humans versus nonhuman predators. Badgers (Meles meles) in Britain are a model mesocarnivore insofar as they no longer need fear native large carnivores (bears, Ursus arctos; wolves, Canis lupus) and now perhaps fear humans more. We tested the fearfulness badgers demonstrated to audio playbacks of extant (dog) and extinct (bear and wolf) large carnivores, and humans, by assaying the suppression of foraging behavior. Hearing humans affected latency to feed, vigilance, foraging time, number of feeding visits, and number of badgers feeding. Hearing dogs and bears had far lesser effects on latency to feed, and hearing wolves had no effects. Our results indicate fear of humans evidently cannot substitute for the fear large carnivores inspire in mesocarnivores because humans are perceived as far more frightening, which we discuss in light of the recovery of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.","[Clinchy, Michael; Zanette, Liana Y.; Roberts, Devin; Suraci, Justin P.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Suraci, Justin P.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC V8L 3Y3, Canada; [Buesching, Christina D.; Newman, Chris; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House, Tubney OX13 5QL, England",,"Clinchy, M (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",mclinchy@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; UK People's Trust for Endangered Species Grant,This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants to M.C. and L.Y.Z. and a UK People's Trust for Endangered Species Grant to D.W.M.,,56,73,74,9,98,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing white-tailed deer to the vocalizations of humans, extant or locally extirpated non-human predators (coyotes, cougars, dogs, wolves), or non-predator controls (birds), at supplemental food patches to measure the relative impacts on deer feeding behavior. Deer were more than twice as likely to flee upon hearing humans than other predators, and hearing humans was matched only by hearing wolves in reducing overall feeding time gaged by visits to the food patch in the following hour. Combined with previous, site-specific research linking deer fecundity to predator abundance, this study reveals that fear of humans has the potential to induce a larger effect on ungulate reproduction than has ever been reported. By demonstrating that deer most fear the human 'super predator', our results point to the fear humans induce in large ungulates having population- and community-level impacts comparable to those caused by the fear humans induce in large carnivores.","[Crawford, Daniel A.; Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Dept Rangeland & Wildlife Sci, 700 Univ Blvd,MSC 218, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Crawford, Daniel A.; Conner, L.

Where both disturbance types co-occur, disentangling their impacts remains a challenge. Disturbance effects may interact such that species respond to increased human footprint by either reducing (habituation) or increasing (sensitization) avoidance of human presence. We experimentally manipulated perceived human presence, using playbacks of people talking, across a gradient of human footprint in California's Santa Cruz Mountains and used camera traps to quantify the behavioral responses of bobcats (Lynx rufus), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), mesopredators known to exhibit strong fear response to human presence, but which vary in their use of developed areas. Bobcats and skunks reduced activity in response to human playbacks but showed no change in responsiveness to playbacks across the gradient of human footprint, suggesting that these species are similarly fearful of humans at all infrastructure development levels tested. Opossums exhibited a significant interaction between human footprint and playback treatment such that reductions in activity level in response to human playbacks were strongest at higher levels of building density. Our results indicate that, rather than habituating to human presence some mesopredators retain a strong fear of humans or become more fearful when inhabiting more developed areas. We suggest that consistently high responsiveness to immediate human presence may benefit mesopredators living in human-dominated landscapes by mitigating the risk of anthropogenic mortality. Mesopredators remain fearful of humans, whether they are in remote, protected areas, or in the backyards of densely populated suburbs. Using an experimental approach, we show that bobcats and striped skunks exhibit a consistent fear response to people, regardless of level of human footprint. Meanwhile, Virginia opossums exhibit heightened fear in areas of high human disturbance. Maintaining a strong fear response to humans may help mesopredators coexist in human-dominated landscapes.","[Reilly, Chloe M.; Suraci, Justin P.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, Truckee, CA 96161 USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wang, Yiwei] San Francisco Bay Bird Observ, 524 Valley Way, Milpitas, CA 95035 USA",,"Reilly, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",cmreilly@ucsc.edu,,,Resources Legacy Fund; Peninsula Open Space Trust,"This work was supported by the Resources Legacy Fund and the Peninsula Open Space Trust.

We examined whether a threat-relevant predator odor (2-methyl-2-thiazoline) would contextually enhance the formation of human fear memory associations. Participants who learned to associate visual stimuli with electric shock in this predator odor context later showed stronger fear responses to the visual stimuli than participants who learned in an aversiveness-matched control odor context. This effect generalized to testing in another odor context, even after extinction training. Results of a separate experiment indicate that a possible biological mechanism for this effect may be increased cortisol levels in a predator odor context. These results suggest that innate olfactory processes can play an important role in human fear learning. Modulatory influences of odor contexts may partly explain the sometimes maladaptive persistence of human fear memory, e.g., in post-traumatic stress disorders.","[Taylor, Jessica E.; Lau, Hakwan; Kawato, Mitsuo; Koizumi, Ai] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback DecNef, Computat Neurosci Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Lau, Hakwan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Lau, Hakwan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Seymour, Ben; Kawato, Mitsuo; Koizumi, Ai] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Osaka, Japan; [Seymour, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Computat & Biol Learning Lab, Cambridge, England; [Seymour, Ben] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Cognit Mech Labs, Dept Neural Computat Decis Making, Kyoto, Japan; [Nakae, Aya] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Osaka, Japan; [Sumioka, Hidenobu] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Hiroshi Ishiguro Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Koizumi, Ai] Sony Comp Sci Labs Inc, Tokyo, Japan",,"Taylor, JE; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback DecNef, Computat Neurosci Labs, Kyoto, Japan.; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Osaka, Japan.; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Sony Comp Sci Labs Inc, Tokyo, Japan.",jessie.elizabeth.taylor@gmail.com; bellkoizumi@gmail.com,"Sumioka, Hidenobu/AAA-7026-2021","Sumioka, Hidenobu/0000-0003-1511-9525; Kawato, Mitsuo/0000-0001-8185-1197","ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan); Brain/Mind Beyond program of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [JP19dm0307008]; JT presto [JPMJPR18J3]; Versus ArthritisVersus Arthritis [21537]","This work was supported by the ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan), by the Brain/Mind Beyond program of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (JP19dm0307008), by JT presto (JPMJPR18J3), and by Versus Arthritis: 21537.",,59,5,5,4,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

Humans have supplanted large carnivores as apex predators in many systems, and similarly pervasive impacts may now result from fear of the human 'super predator'. We conducted a landscape-scale playback experiment demonstrating that the sound of humans speaking generates a landscape of fear with pervasive effects across wildlife communities. Large carnivores avoided human voices and moved more cautiously when hearing humans, while medium-sized carnivores became more elusive and reduced foraging. Small mammals evidently benefited, increasing habitat use and foraging. Thus, just the sound of a predator can have landscape-scale effects at multiple trophic levels.

We introduce the concept of hunting for fear' as an extension of the more classical hunting to kill' that is typically used in large herbivore management. Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves.

While many studies have used flight initiation distance as a proxy for fearfulness and examined the factors influencing the decision to flee, there is no general understanding of the relative importance of these factors. By identifying factors with large effect sizes, we can determine whether anti-predator strategies reduce fear, and we gain a unique perspective on the coevolution of predator and anti-predator behaviour. Based on an extensive review and formal meta-analysis, we found that predator traits that were associated with greater risk (speed, size, directness of approach), increased prey distance to refuge and experience with predators consistently amplified the perception of risk (in terms of flight initiation distance). While fish tolerated closer approach when in larger schools, other taxa had greater flight initiation distances when in larger groups. The presence of armoured and cryptic morphologies decreased perception of risk, but body temperature in lizards had no robust effect on flight initiation distance. We find that selection generally acts on prey to be sensitive to predator behaviour, as well as on prey to modify their behaviour and morphology.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Stankowich, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Anim Behav Grad Grp, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",tstankowich@ucdavis.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244",,,,59,645,669,8,362,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Combined with our previous work showing higher kill rates of deer in more urbanized landscapes, this study reveals that fear is the mechanism driving an ecological cascade from humans to increased puma predation on deer. By demonstrating that the fear of humans can cause a strong reduction in feeding by pumas, our results support that non-consumptive forms of human disturbance may alter the ecological role of large carnivores.","[Smith, Justine A.; Suraci, Justin P.; Crawford, Ayana; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.; Clinchy, Michael; Roberts, Devin; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Smith, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jsmith5@ucsc.edu,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation grant #1255913, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",,30,87,89,12,118,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

As widespread apex predators, humans present a significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain lions Puma concolor to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Mendocino County, California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct, contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for prey. Our study highlights the importance of temporal partitioning as a mechanism of predation risk avoidance.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; McInturff, Alex; Brashares, Justin S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,,,California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Rhodes Trust; Safari Club International Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Schmidt Science Fellows in partnership with Rhodes Trust; Safari Club International Foundation; National Science Foundation,,66,0,0,16,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Human activities can indirectly shape this landscape of fear by altering behavior and spatial distribution of carnivores. We studied how red deer perceive the landscape of fear in an old-growth forest system (Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland) both at large and fine spatial scale. Camera traps were placed at locations with and without tree logs (fine-scale risk factor) and at different distances from the core of a wolf territory and human settlements (large-scale risk factor). Red deer avoided coming close to large tree logs and increased their vigilance levels when they were present in close vicinity. The strength of these effects depended on the distance to the wolf core area; deer perceived tree logs as more risky when wolves were more often present. Hence, tree logs inside wolf core areas create fine-scale patches of fear with reduced deer browsing pressure, thereby enhancing chances for successful tree recruitment. Human presence shapes this landscape of fear as wolf core areas are located far from human settlements. This human shadow on predator-prey interactions is therefore an important component that should be taken into account in human-dominated landscapes.","[Kuijper, Dries P.

In addition to these overt changes to animals' behavior, observers may have more subtle impacts on animals' foraging decisions. However, the anthropogenic alteration of risk-taking behavior has rarely been acknowledged or quantified, particularly in behavioral ecological studies reliant on habituated animals. We tested the magnitude of the human shield effect experimentally on 2 groups of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarcus, at a site with high natural predator density and no human hunting pressure. In general, giving-up densities-the density of food remaining in a patch when a forager leaves-were greatest at ground level (0.1 m) relative to 3 tree canopy levels (2.5, 5, and 7.5 m), highlighting a strong vertical axis of fear. When human followers were present, however, giving-up densities were reduced at all 4 heights; furthermore, for 1 group, the vertical axis disappeared in the presence of observers. Our results suggest that human observers lower monkeys' perceived risk of terrestrial predators and, thereby, affect their foraging decisions at or near ground level. These results have significant implications for future studies of responses to predation risk based on habituation and observational methods.","[Nowak, Katarzyna; Hill, Russell A.] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Evolutionary Anthropol Res Grp, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Nowak, Katarzyna; le Roux, Aliza] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-9866 Qwaqwa, Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa; [Nowak, Katarzyna; Hill, Russell A.] Lajuma Res Ctr, Primate & Predator Project, ZA-0920 Makhado, South Africa; [Richards, Shane A.] Univ Durham, Dept Biol & Biomed Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Scheijen, Ciska P.

Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 % more nocturnal and three species become 11.7% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans' avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defamation.","[Mendes, Calebe P.; Carreira, Daiane; Pedrosa, Felipe; Beca, Gabrielle; Lautenschlager, Lais; Akkawi, Paula; Berce, William; Galetti, Mauro] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Lab Biol Conservacao LABIC,UNESP, Ave 24A,1515, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Carreira, Daiane; Ferraz, Katia M.

In Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) depend on a nearly continuous intake of berries, especially bilberries (Vaccinium myrtilius) during late summer and early autumn to fatten up prior to hibernation. This overlaps with the bear hunting season that starts on 21 August. Bilberry occurrence varies across space, as does human-induced mortality risk. Here, we hypothesize that brown bears select for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence across a boreal forest ecosystem in Sweden (H1), and that human-induced mortality risk reduces bear selection for bilberries (H2). In addition, we hypothesized that hears that survived the hunting season avoided bilberry areas associated with high risk, whereas bears that were later killed selected more strongly for berries and less against risk prior to the hunting season (H3). To evaluate our hypotheses, we used resource selection functions to contrast bear GPS relocation data (N = 3 5, 2012-2015) and random positions within the bears home range with generalized linear mixed effect models against two focal variables: a map predicting bilberry occurrence and a map predicting human-induced mortality risk. We found that bears selected for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence (supporting H1), but avoided these areas if they were associated with and high risk of hunting mortality (supporting H2). The killed and surviving bears did not differ in their selection for bilberries, hut they did differ in their selection against risk (partially supporting H3). Surviving bears strongly avoided high risk areas, whereas killed hears responded less to risk and selected for high-risk areas with a low probability of bilberry occurrence. This suggests that killed bears selected for other food sources than berries in high risk areas, which exposed them to human hunters. We conclude that bears respond to a landscape of fear during the berry season and that different foraging strategies may have a direct impact on individual mortality during the hunting season.

Large predators and mesopredators usually produce this fear in animals. This effect is recognised in the form of various behavioural changes and adaptations, which, in turn, affects the whole ecosystem. However, we often overlook the role of large predators and mesopredators in the sustenance of our ecosystem by such non-lethal effects, because fear is often seen as a psychological effect rather than something that can be found through explicit scientific means. Indeed, the fear that predators trigger inside their prey may play a significant role in the maintenance of the natural environment. This paper aims to analyse this hypothesis by reviewing the function of the ecology of fear based on the interaction among predators, prey, and mesopredators. We consider the factors involved in the effective functionality of the ecology of fear, including habitat landscape, season, weather, and predation risk. We also assess the extent of influence of large predators on behaviour and distribution of prey and mesopredators in terms of predation cues and prey grouping as responses to predation risk. Finally, we discuss the implications of fear ecology for wildlife conservation and management and new challenges.","[Mpemba, H.; Yang, F.; Jiang, G.] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, G (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",jgshun@126.com,,"Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017PZ14]; National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC 31872241, 31572285]","We thank our colleagues in the Feline Research Center of National Foretry and Grassland Administration, College of Wildlife and Protected Areas, Northeast Forestry University for their appreciated suggestions during the preparation of this work.

Yet, seldom are parents observed across multiple reproductive bouts, with few studies considering anthropogenic disturbances as an ecological driver of maternal effects. We observed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs over two successive litters to determine whether among-litter differences in behavior (i.e., risk-taking) and hormones (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) corresponded with parental plasticity in habituation. Thus, we explicitly test the hypothesis that accumulating experiences of anthropogenic disturbance reduces parental fear across reproductive bouts, which should have disparate phenotypic consequences for first- and second-litter offspring. To quantify risk-taking behavior, we used foraging assays from 5-15 weeks of age with a human observer present as a proxy for human disturbance. At 5, 10, and 15 weeks of age, we collected shaved hair to quantify pup hormone levels. We then used a quantitative genetic approach to estimate heritability, repeatability, and between-trait correlations. We found that parents were riskier (i.e., foraged more frequently) with their second versus first litters, supporting our prediction that parents become increasingly habituated over time. Second-litter pups were also less risk-averse than their first-litter siblings. Heritability for all traits did not differ from zero (0.001-0.018); however, we found moderate support for repeatability in all observed traits (r = 0.085-0.421). Lastly, we found evidence of positive phenotypic and cohort correlations among pup traits, implying that cohort identity (i.e., common environment) contributes to the development of phenotypic syndromes in coyote pups. Our results suggest that parental habituation may be an ecological cue for offspring to reduce their fear response, thus emphasizing the role of parental plasticity in shaping their pups' behavioral and hormonal responses toward humans.","[Schell, Christopher J.; Santymire, Rachel M.; Mateo, Jill M.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schell, Christopher J.] Univ Washington, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Tacoma, WA USA; [Young, Julie K.] Utah State Univ, USDA WS NWRC, Predator Res Facil, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Lonsdorf, Elizabeth V.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Psychol, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Santymire, Rachel M.] Lincoln Pk Zoo, Conservat & Sci Dept, Chicago, IL USA",,"Schell, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cjschell@uw.edu,"; Schell, Christopher/Q-9654-2017","Lonsdorf, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8057-401X; Santymire, Rachel/0000-0003-4102-9144; Schell, Christopher/0000-0002-2073-9852",Pritzker School of Medicine (Hinds Fellowship); Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (NWRC Predator Research Facility Fellowship); United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corporation (MERCK Fellowship); MerckMerck & Company; U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [72184]; University of ChicagoUniversity of Chicago; Directorate for Biological Sciences (NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)),"Pritzker School of Medicine, Grant/Award Number: Hinds Fellowship (2011, 2013); Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Grant/Award Number: NWRC Predator Research Facility Fellowship; United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corporation, Grant/Award Number: MERCK Fellowship; Directorate for Biological Sciences, Grant/Award Number: NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP); Merck; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 72184; University of Chicago",,156,21,21,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Yet energetic constraints on movement imposed by the physical landscape have only been considered separately from those imposed by risk avoidance, limiting our understanding of how short-term movement decisions scale up to affect long-term space use. Here, we integrate the costs of both physical terrain and predation risk into a common currency, energy, and then quantify their effects on the short-term movement and long-term spatial ecology of a large carnivore living in a human-dominated landscape. Using high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data from collared pumas (Puma concolor), we calculated the short-term (i.e., 5-min) energetic costs of navigating both rugged physical terrain and a landscape of risk from humans (major sources of both mortality and fear for our study population). Both the physical and risk landscapes affected puma short-term movement costs, with risk having a relatively greater impact by inducing high-energy but low-efficiency movement behavior. The cumulative effects of short-term movement costs led to reductions of 29% to 68% in daily travel distances and total home range area. For male pumas, long-term patterns of space use were predominantly driven by the energetic costs of human-induced risk. This work demonstrates that, along with physical terrain, predation risk plays a primary role in shaping an animal's energy landscape and suggests that fear of humans may be a major factor affecting wildlife movements worldwide.","[Nickel, Barry A.; Suraci, Justin P.; Nisi, Anna C.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Nickel, BA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",bnickel@ucsc.edu,,"Nisi, Anna/0000-0003-0286-3187","Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913, 0963022]","We thank P.

Despite recent conceptual advances and potential management implications of the ecology of fear, theory and conservation practices have rarely been linked. Many challenges in animal conservation may be alleviated by actively harnessing or compensating for risk perception and risk avoidance behavior in wild animal populations. Integration of the ecology of fear into conservation and management practice can contribute to the recovery of threatened populations, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, invasive species management, maintenance of sustainable harvest and species reintroduction plans. Here, we present an applied framework that links conservation interventions to desired outcomes by manipulating ecology of fear dynamics. We discuss how to reduce or amplify fear in wild animals by manipulating habitat structure, sensory stimuli, animal experience (previous exposure to risk) and food safety trade-offs to achieve management objectives. Changing the optimal decision-making of individuals in managed populations can then further conservation goals by shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of animals, changing predation rates and altering risk effects that scale up to demographic consequences. We also outline future directions for applied research on fear ecology that will better inform conservation practices. Our framework can help scientists and practitioners anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences of management decisions, and highlight new levers for multi-species conservation strategies that promote human-wildlife coexistence.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX USA; [Gilbert, Sophie L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Kohl, Michel T.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Larson, Courtney L.] Nature Conservancy, Lander, WY USA; [Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Young, Julie K.] USDA, Predator Res Facil, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Millville, UT USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Newsome, Thomas M/ABE-8451-2021; Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Newsome, Thomas M/0000-0003-3457-3256; Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061; Kohl, Michel/0000-0001-8218-1455; Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543; Gilbert, Sophie/0000-0002-9974-5146",Wildlife Society Damage Control Working Group; Schmidt Science Fellows program; Rhodes Trust; USDA -National Wildlife Research CenterUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"This study arose from an organized symposium at The Wildlife Society's 2018 conference in Cleveland, Ohio, When does fear matter in wildlife management?

Assessing the nature of these alterations to trophic interactions requires an understanding of how species' demography and behavior are altered by simultaneous, complex pressures. For predator-prey relationships, landscapes of fear have been used to measure the trade-off prey animals make between maximizing energy gain and minimizing risk of predation. However, hierarchical foraging theory predicts that the degree to which aggregations of resources are used will depend upon the context in which they occur, not merely on the predation risk associated with those patches. We develop a conceptual framework that synthesizes theories of foraging hierarchies and landscapes of fear to show how predation risk and resource variation may interact to influence foraging behavior. We show, experimentally, that northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), do respond to the likely predation risk when making their foraging decisions; however, the food resources in the habitat surrounding the food patch also play a significant role in the degree to which food patches are used. This result has important implications for the accuracy of assessments of landscapes of fear and habitat use using observations of animal foraging behavior.","[Searle, Kate R.; Stokes, Chris J.; Gordon, Iain J.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Sustainable, Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia",,"Searle, KR (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Sustainable, Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia.",krsearle@nrel.colostate.edu,"Gordon, Iain/S-8076-2019; Stokes, Chris J/G-5199-2010; Stokes, Chris/AAR-2890-2021; Gordon, Iain J/K-8636-2012; Searle, Kate R/F-4922-2011","Gordon, Iain/0000-0001-9704-0946; Stokes, Chris J/0000-0003-1576-2457; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-1576-2457; Gordon, Iain J/0000-0001-9704-0946; Searle, Kate R/0000-0003-4624-9023",,,,47,38,40,5,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Exposure to human activity can cause animals to avoid human dominated areas or shift temporal activity patterns, but repeated, benign exposure can also result in habituation of individuals. Habituation is typically viewed as a negative potential consequence of human interactions with wildlife, with effects such as increased vulnerability of habituated animals to predation. Concurrently, the advancement of the understanding of the ecology of fear has shown reduced fitness in species because of behavioral changes in responses to fear of predators including humans. Here, we test how habituation and fear drive the foraging ecology of brown bears (Ursus arctos) feeding on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Southeast Alaska, USA. We used motion-detecting trail cameras at salmon spawning areas across a gradient of human disturbance to record human and bear activity at fine spatial and extended temporal scales. Higher human activity was associated with increased nocturnality of non-habituated bears, likely leading to suboptimal foraging, but had no effect on habituated individuals. For the top 20% of sites for which human activity was greatest, an average of 78.7% of the activity of non habituated bears was nocturnal, compared with an average of only 10.2% of the activity of habituated individuals. Habituation of brown bears in this system alleviated perceived risk and avoidance of human activity, allowing habituated individuals to overcome their fear of human presence and maximize foraging opportunities. While habituation may lessen some of the deleterious effects of human activity on large carnivores, the long-term effects of habituation may be negative, as habituated individuals may be at greater risk of depredation. Future research should examine whether habituated bears and their lower perceived risk of human activity ultimately experience smaller population-level effects of human disturbance than non-habituated individuals.","[Wheat, Rachel E.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Wheat, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rwheat@ucsc.edu,,,NSF GRFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This work was funded by an NSF GRF to R.E.W.

Humans have strong numerical effects on wild animal populations, as highly efficient hunters and through unintentional impacts of human activity and development. Human disturbance also induces costly non-lethal effects by changing the behavior of risk-averse animals. Here, we suggest that the unique strength of these lethal and non-lethal effects is amplified by mismatches between the nature of risk associated with anthropogenic stimuli and the corresponding response by wild animals. We discuss the unique characteristics of cues associated with anthropogenic stimuli in the context of animal ecology and evolutionary history to explore why and when animals fail to appropriately (a) detect, (b) assess, and (c) respond to both benign and lethal stimuli. We then explore the costs of over-response to a benign stimulus (Type I error) and under-response to a lethal stimulus (Type II error), which can scale up to affect individual fitness and ultimately drive population dynamics and shape ecological interactions.

Studies indicate that cat odor and trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a synthetic compound isolated from fox feces, are often presented to rodents to induce fear-related responses including freezing, avoidance, stress hormone and, in some tests, risk assessment behavior. Furthermore, we report that different amounts of cat odor impregnated on small-, medium-, or large-sized cloths impact the display of fear-related behavior when presented to rats. That is, rats exposed to a large cat odor containing cloth exhibit an increase in fear behavior, particularly freezing, which remains at high levels in habituation tests administered over a period of 7 days. The large cloth also induces a long-lasting increase in avoidance behavior during repeated habituation and extinction tests. A review of the brain regions involved in predator odor-induced fear behavior indicates a modulatory role of the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and dorsal premammillary nucleus. In addition, the basolateral amygdala is involved in fear behavior induced by cat odor but not TMT, and the central amygdala does not appear to play a major behavioral role in predator odor-induced fear. Future research involving the use of predator odor is likely to rapidly expand knowledge on the neurobiology of fear, which has implications for understanding fear-related psychopathology.

Researchers are beginning to identify brain sites associated with conditioned contextual fear such as the ventral anterior olfactory nucleus, dorsal premammillary nucleus, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, cuneiform nucleus, and locus coeruleus. In addition, a few studies have reported an involvement of the basolateral and medial nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampus in fear conditioning. However, several important issues concerning the effectiveness of different predator odor unconditioned stimuli to produce fear conditioning, the precise role of brain nuclei in fear conditioning, and the general relation between the current predator odor and the traditional electric foot-shock fear conditioning procedures remain to be satisfactorily addressed. This review discusses the major behavioral results in the current predator odor fear conditioning literature and introduces two novel contextual and auditory fear conditioning models using cat odor. The new models provide critical information on the acquisition of conditioned fear behavior during training and the expression of conditioned responses in the retention test.

Here, we explored people's landscapes of fear by investigating their perceptions of spatio-temporal variation in the risk of encountering wildlife, and how those perceptions influence their movement. We conducted a participatory risk mapping exercise with people living in the buffer zones of two protected areas in central India, which provide habitat to tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and numerous crop-raiding herbivores. We then tracked people's movement using GPS devices and explored how their movement related to their risk maps. Results of integrated step selection functions show that perceived risk influenced the speed and directedness with which people move, mixed evidence that perceived risk influenced where people went (habitat selection), and variation in how individuals responded to risks from different species. Future research on how humans and wildlife adapt to each other should investigate (1) human behavioral responses to wildlife over longer periods of time, (2) how movement affects the spatial patterns of human-wildlife conflict, and (3) the cultural and cognitive dimensions of how risk and emotions influence people's movement decisions.","[Read, Daniel J.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Habib, Bilal] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Stabach, Jared; Leimgruber, Peter] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Natl Zool Pk, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA",,"Read, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.",dread@umces.edu,"Leimgruber, Peter/O-1304-2015","Leimgruber, Peter/0000-0002-3682-0153; Read, Daniel/0000-0001-6768-2753; Stabach, Jared/0000-0002-7896-1237",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [201516684]; US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Internship Program,"This work was supported by a US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (Fellow ID: 201516684), and the US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Internship Program.",,88,0,0,7,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Fear is a defensive mechanism evolved to protect animals from danger by balancing the animals' needs for primary resources with the risk of predation, and the amygdala is implicated in mediating fear responses. However, the functions of fear and amygdala in foraging behavior are not well characterized because of the technical difficulty in quantifying prey-predator interaction with real (unpredictable) predators. Thus, the present study investigated the rat's foraging behavior in a seminaturalistic environment when confronted with a predator-like robot programmed to surge toward the animal seeking food. Rats initially fled into the nest and froze (demonstrating fear) and then cautiously approached and seized the food as a function of decreasing nest-food and increasing food-robot distances. The likelihood of procuring food increased and decreased via lesioning/inactivating and disinhibiting the amygdala, respectively. These results indicate that the amygdala bidirectionally regulates risk behavior in rats foraging in a dynamic fear environment.","[Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Program Neurobiol & Behav, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Choi, June-Seek] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul 136701, South Korea",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,"Kim, Jeansok/0000-0001-7964-106X","Korean governmentKorean Government [MEST 2009-008145]; Ministry of Education, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea [2009K001284]; Republic of Korea; Seoul Broadcasting System Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH64457]; James McKeen Cattell Sabbatical Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH064457] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Paul E.

Yet fear effects are not always the predominant driver of predator-prey interactions. Thus, guiding ecological principles have not been assembled to explain the broader food web interactions that shape the context dependency of carnivore-livestock conflict. We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework as a way to think about the contingencies under which inducing non-consumptive 'fear effects' on predators would be effective to mitigate carnivore-livestock conflict. The framework specifically considers interactions among wildlife (carnivore predators, wild ungulate prey) and humans (people and livestock) in terms of spatial predator-prey assemblages in which the nature of wildlife-human interactions - as either a carnivore-livestock conflict or a coexistence food web - is contingent on the nature of spatial movement and overlap of humans and wildlife across landscapes. Considering human-wildlife interactions within such a spatial food web context can assist in enabling people and wildlife, especially imperiled carnivores, to coexist in human-modified landscapes. The framework offers predictions that should be tested via adaptive management experiments that evaluate whether conflict mitigation solutions aligned with particular spatial human-livestock-carnivore contexts do indeed resolve conflict.","[Miller, Jennifer R.

The bulk of the data suggest that the amygdala can be activated from potentially accessible but unattended fear stimuli. Activation of the amygdala facilitates low level visual processing. Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of the amygdala is mediated by a subcortical pathway. Thus, according to data from patients with lesions in the primary visual cortex, the amygdala can be activated in the absence of cortical processing. There is considerable support for the hypothesis that visual stimuli can access the amygdala via a pathway that includes the superior colliculus and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. These data are consistent with an evolutionary argument, focusing of the role of snakes as a predator on primates. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Fear can be innate or learned. Examples of innate fear include fears that are triggered by predators, pain, heights, rapidly approaching objects, and ancestral threats such as snakes and spiders. Animals and humans detect and respond more rapidly to threatening stimuli than to nonthreatening stimuli in the natural world. The threatening stimuli for most animals are predators, and most predators are themselves prey to other animals. Predatory avoidance is of crucial importance for survival of animals. Although humans are rarely affected by predators, we are constantly challenged by social threats such as a fearful or angry facial expression.

However, it has not been sufficiently examined whether other arthropods similarly elicit fear or disgust. Our aim was to examine if all arthropods are rated similarly, if only potentially dangerous arthropods (spiders, bees/wasps) elicit comparable responses, or if spiders are rated in a unique way. We presented pictures of arthropods (15 spiders, 15 beetles, 15 bees/wasps, and 15 butterflies/moths) to 76 students who rated each picture for fear, disgust, and how dangerous they thought the animal is. They also categorized each animal into one of the four animal groups. In addition, we assessed the participants' fear of spiders and estimates for trait anxiety. The ratings showed that spiders elicit significantly greater fear and disgust than any other arthropod group, and spiders were rated as more dangerous. Fear and disgust ratings of spider pictures significantly predicted the questionnaire scores for fear of spiders, whereas dangerousness ratings of spiders and ratings of other arthropods do not provide any predictive power. Thus, spider fear is in fact spider specific. Our results demonstrate that potential harmfulness alone cannot explain why spiders are feared so frequently. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A defense mode observed at intermediate threat levels is freezing: a cessation of locomotion that is characterized by a parasympathetically dominated autonomic nervous system response that causes heart rate deceleration, or fear bradycardia. Studies in rodents have shown that freezing depends on amygdalar projections to the periaqueductal grey (PAG). In humans, freezing-like behaviors are implicated in development and maintenance of psychopathology, but neural mechanisms underlying freezing or its characteristic autonomic response profile have not been identified. Here, we combined event-related blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) with autonomic response measures in a picture viewing paradigm to probe activity and interconnectivity within the amygdala-PAG pathway and test for an association with parasympathetic as opposed to sympathetic activation. In response to negatively arousing pictures, we observed parasympathetic (bradycardia) and sympathetic (pupil dilation) autonomic responses, BOLD responses in the amygdala and PAG, and effective connectivity between these regions. Critically, BOLD responses in the PAG to negative pictures correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with bradycardia but not pupil dilation. This correlation with bradycardia remained significant when partialling out pupil dilation. Additionally, activity in regions associated with motor planning and inhibition mirrored the PAG response. Thus, our findings implicate the human PAG in a parasympathetically dominated defense mode that subserves a state of attentive immobility. Mechanistic insight into this qualitatively distinct defense mode may importantly advance translational models of anxiety disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Subjects (n = 13) were initially submitted to four habituation trials. followed by four random confrontation sessions for each test (DZP 0, 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg). Each trial was divided into three consecutive 5-min intervals: pre-exposure, exposure (human observer, taxidermized oncilla cat) and post-exposure. As DZP induced sedation, marmosets (n = 10) were re-tested in a second experiment, consisting of two habituation trials and four confrontation sessions per stimulus, with lower DZP doses (0, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg). Exposure to both stimuli significantly increased direct gazes and alarm calls, being dose-dependently reduced by DZP only in the PC test. In the HT protocol, the significant decrease in aerial scans was not detected with 0.10 mg/kg DZP. Locomotion, proximity, displacement activities and vigilance were not consistently influenced by the stimuli and/or DZP. The results thus suggest that the FIT test had a greater impact on the marmosets' behavior, while DZP was more effective on the reactions observed in the PC test, possibly due to the inherent nature of each stimulus, distinct threat levels and/or presentation order.

While this indirect effect of natural predators on ecosystems is becoming better understood, far less is known about how humans-the world's most ubiquitous super-predator-influence subsequent trophic levels through changes in carnivore habitat use and behavior. Here, we combined puma GPS tracking data with field experiments to understand the extent to which anthropogenic development has cascading impacts from pumas to plants. We examined spatial patterns in puma feeding sites and found that pumas preferentially kill deer away (>340 m) from human development. This aversion appears to create refugia for deer, as deer more than doubled their relative activity near (<70 m) human development. In addition, deer more than quadrupled their consumption of woody vegetation at low-risk sites close to humans relative to comparable high-risk sites far from humans and consumed a greater percent of the forage available in sites near humans than in comparable sites farther away. Increased browsing by deer in near human, or low-risk, sites induced woody plants to become bushier (by removing apical dominance) than those away from humans, or high-risk sites. The cascading interactions from pumas avoiding people to changes in plant architecture appear to have increased available food to deer (i.e., bushier plants have more available branch ends providing potential bites of food than less bushy individuals) and may have other, as yet undocumented, ecological effects.","[Yovovich, Veronica; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Yovovich, Veronica] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 145 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Thomsen, Meredith] Univ Wisconsin, Biol Dept, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Thomsen, Meredith] Univ Wisconsin, River Studies Ctr, 1725 State St, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA",,"Yovovich, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.; Yovovich, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 145 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",vyovovich@gmail.com,,"Thomsen, Meredith/0000-0001-9843-5202","California Department of Fish and Wildlife; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913, 0963022]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; American Museum of Natural History; University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Department","We thank the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for their support of funding and staff; B.

Previous studies indicated that the acid sensing ion channel ASIC1 a influences fear behavior in conditioning paradigms. However,these differences may have resulted from an ASIC1 a effect on learning, memory, or the expression of fear. Methods: To test the hypothesis that ASIC1a influences the expression of fear or anxiety independent of classical conditioning, we examined the effects of disrupting the mouse ASIC1a gene on unconditioned fear in the open field test, unconditioned acoustic startle, and fear evoked by the predator odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT). In addition, we tested the effects of acutely inhibiting ASIC1 a with PcTx, an ASIC1a antagonist in tarantula venom. Our immunohistochemistry suggested ASIC1a is expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdala, and periaqueductal gray, which are thought to play important roles in the generation and expression of innate fear. Therefore, we also tested whether ASIC1 a disruption altered c-fos expression in these structures following TMT exposure. Results: We found that the loss of ASIC1 a reduced fear in the open field test, reduced acoustic startle, and inhibited the fear response to TMT. Similarly, intracerebroventricular administration of PcTx reduced TMT-evoked freezing in ASIC1a(+/+) mice but not ASIC1a(-/-) mice. In addition, loss of ASIC1 a altered TMT-evoked c-fos expression in the medial amydala and dorsal periaqueductal gray. Conclusions: These findings suggest that ASIC1 a modulates activity in the circuits underlying innate fear. Furthermore, the data indicate that targeting the ASIC1a gene or acutely inhibiting ASIC1 a suppresses fear and anxiety independent of conditioning.","Univ Iowa, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Neurosci Program, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; Univ Iowa, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",,"Wemmie, JA (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, 500 Eckstein Med Res Bldg, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",john-wemmie@uiowa.edu,,"Wemmie, John/0000-0001-7531-9065; Zha, Xiangming/0000-0001-9490-2731",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM007337] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,68,100,103,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

However, the specific role of these amygdalar nuclei in predator odor-induced fear memory is not known. Therefore, fiber-sparing lesions or temporary inactivation of the BLA or MeA were made either prior to or after exposure to cat odor, and conditioned contextual fear behavior was examined the next day. BLA and MeA lesions produced significant reductions in cat odor-induced unconditioned and conditioned fear-related behavior. In addition, temporary pharmacological neural inactivation methods occurring after exposure to cat odor revealed subtle behavioral alterations indicative of a role of the BLA in fear memory consolidation but not memory retrieval. In contrast, the MeA appears to play a specific role in retrieval but not consolidation. Results show that the BLA participates in the conditioned and unconditioned cat odor stimulus association that underlies fear memory, underscore a novel role of the MeA in predator odor contextual conditioning, and demonstrate different roles of the BLA and MeA in modulating consolidation and retrieval of predator odor fear memory.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Psychol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,"Takahashi, LK (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Psychobiol Lab, 2430 Campus Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",lkt@hawaii.edu,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R25GM056930] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [U54NS039406] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [5 R25 GM56930-07] Funding Source: Medline; NINDS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [NS 39406] Funding Source: Medline,,,34,67,68,1,13,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

Recently, in addition to direct effects, it has been shown that indirect (non-lethal) effects of predation risk are predominant in many populations. Predation risk is often structured in space and time, generating a heterogeneous landscape of fear within which animals can minimize risks by modifying their habitat use. Furthermore, for ungulates, resource quality seems to be positively correlated with human-related sources of risk. We studied the trade-off between access to resources of high-quality and risk-taking by contrasting habitat use of roe deer during daytime with that during nighttime for 94 roe deer in a hunted population. Our first hypothesis was that roe deer should avoid human disturbance by modifying their habitat use during daytime compared to nighttime. Our results supported this, as roe deer mainly used open fields during nighttime, but used more forested habitats during daytime, when human disturbance is higher. Moreover, we found that diel patterns in habitat use were influenced by hunting disturbance. Indeed, the roe deer decreased their use of high-crops during daytime, an important source of cover and food, during the hunting season. The proximity of roads and dwellings also affected habitat use, since roe deer used open fields during daytime to a greater extent when the distance to these sources of disturbance was higher. Hence, our results suggest that roe deer resolve the trade-off between the acquisition of high-quality resources and risk avoidance by modifying their habitat use between day and night.","[Bonnot, Nadege; Morellet, Nicolas; Verheyden, Helene; Cargnelutti, Bruno; Lourtet, Bruno; Hewison, A.

We adapted the FID paradigm to investigate how fast-or slow-attacking virtual predators constrain escape decisions. We show that rapid escape decisions rely on reactive fear circuits in the periaqueductal gray and midcingulate cortex (MCC), while protracted escape decisions, defined by larger buffer zones, were associated with cognitive fear circuits, which include posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, circuits implicated in more complex information processing, cognitive avoidance strategies, and behavioral flexibility. Using a Bayesian decision-making model, we further show that optimization of escape decisions under rapid flight were localized to the MCC, a region involved in adaptive motor control, while the hippocampus is implicated in optimizing decisions that update and control slower escape initiation. These results demonstrate an unexplored link between defensive survival circuits and their role in adaptive escape decisions.","[Qi, Song; Mobbs, Dean] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA; [Qi, Song; Sun, Jiayin] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hassabis, Demis] Google DeepMind, London N1C 4AG, England; [Sun, Jiayin] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Guo, Fangjian] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Daw, Nathaniel] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Qi, S; Mobbs, D (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA.; Qi, S (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sqi@caltech.edu; dmobbs@caltech.edu,,,National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and DepressionNARSAD; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH094258] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank John O'Doherty, Peter Dayan, Alex Shackman, James Curley, and Joe LeDoux for their advice and Nir Jacoby for his work on an earlier version of the paradigm.

Although much research has centered upon the idea that individuals can adaptively modify their behaviors to cope with environmental changes, recent evidence supports the existence of individual differences in suites of correlated behaviors. However, little is known about how selection can change these behavioral structures in populations subject to different environmental constraints. The colonization of urban environments by birds has been related to their inter-individual variability in their fear of humans, measured as their flight initiation distance to an approaching human, such that urban life would select for fearless individuals. This behavior has been demonstrated to be heritable and highly consistent throughout the adult lifespan of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). Here, we experimentally assessed, in field conditions, whether urban life involves changes in other behaviors such as exploration and antipredatory response through their correlation with fear of humans. Breeding urban birds were more fearless toward humans and were quicker to explore a new food resource and defend their nests from predators than their rural counterparts. However, while fear of humans positively correlated with exploration and antipredatory response in the rural population, it only correlated with exploration in the urban one. Predator release in urban environments could relax- and even counterselect-antipredator behaviors, thus dismantling the behavioral correlation existent in natural populations. Altogether, our results suggest that rural and urban animals may differ in some behavioral aspects, may be as a consequence of the selection processes acting during the colonization of urban areas as well as the different ecological environments encountered by individuals.","[Carrete, Martina] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Seville, Spain; [Carrete, Martina; Tella, Jose L.] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estac Biol Donana, Seville, Spain",,"Carrete, M (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Seville, Spain.; Carrete, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estac Biol Donana, Seville, Spain.",mcarrete@upo.es,"Carrete, Martina/D-2618-2017; Carrete, Martina/A-6376-2009","Carrete, Martina/0000-0002-0491-2950","Canal Sur TV; MINECO (Spain) [RYC-2009-04860, CGL2012-31888, CGL2015-71378-P]; Fundacion Repsol","M.

Research on the neurobiology and environmental constraints of innate fear of predators in rodents may be useful in elucidating mechanisms of animal phobias in humans. The present article reviews research on innate fear in rats to trimethylthiazoline (TMT), an odor originally isolated from fox feces. TMT induces unconditioned freezing and other defensive responses that are regulated by the dose of TMT and the shape of the testing environment. Contextual conditioning induced by TMT occurs, but is constrained by the environment. Lesion studies indicate the amygdala circuitry subserving fear conditioning is not necessary for unconditioned fear to TMT. Additionally, a medial hypothalamic defensive circuit also appears not necessary for unconditioned freezing to TMT, whereas circuits that include the medial nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are essential. The importance of these findings of innate predator odor fear in rodents to animal phobias in humans is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The SOS attempts to merge ecological models that define a repertoire of contextually relevant threat induced survival behaviors with contemporary approaches to human affective science. We first propose that the goal of the nervous system is to reduce surprise and optimize actions by (i) predicting the sensory landscape by simulating possible encounters with threat and selecting the appropriate pre-encounter action and (ii) prevention strategies in which the organism manufactures safe environments. When a potential threat is encountered the (iii) threat orienting system is engaged to determine whether the organism ignores the stimulus or switches into a process of (iv) threat assessment, where the organism monitors the stimulus, weighs the threat value, predicts the actions of the threat, searches for safety, and guides behavioral actions crucial to directed escape. When under imminent attack, (v) defensive systems evoke fast reflexive indirect escape behaviors (i.e., fight or flight). This cascade of responses to threat of increasing magnitude are underwritten by an interconnected neural architecture that extends from cortical and hippocampal circuits, to attention, action and threat systems including the amygdala, striatum, and hard wired defensive systems in the midbrain. The SOS also includes a modulatory feature consisting of cognitive appraisal systems that flexibly guide perception, risk and action. Moreover, personal and vicarious threat encounters fine-tune avoidance behaviors via model-based learning, with higher organisms bridging data to reduce face-to-face encounters with predators. Our model attempts to unify the divergent field of human affective science, proposing a highly integrated nervous system that has evolved to increase the organism's chances of survival.","[Mobbs, Dean; Hagan, Cindy C.; Silston, Brian; Prevost, Charlotte] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dalgleish, Tim] MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge, England",,"Mobbs, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, Fear Anxiety & Biosocial Behav Lab, 406 Schermertorn Hall,1190 Amsterdam Ave,MC 5501, New York, NY 10027 USA.",dmobbs@psych.columbia.edu,"Dalgleish, Tim/E-8341-2010","Dalgleish, Tim/0000-0002-7304-2231; Hagan, Cindy/0000-0002-4576-7120; Silston, Brian/0000-0002-3365-0013",Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MC_U105579215] Funding Source: Medline,,,223,146,150,3,60,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-453X,,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

The growth of human populations is, at the same time, causing degradation of natural habitats and increasing interaction rates of humans with wildlife, such that conservation management routinely considers the effects of human disturbance as tantamount to or surpassing those of predators. The need to simultaneously manage both of these threats is particularly acute in urban areas that are, increasingly, being recognized as global hotspots of wildlife activity. Pressures from altered predator-prey interactions and human activity may each initiate fear responses in prey species above those that are triggered by natural stressors in ecosystems. If fear responses are experienced by prey at elevated levels, on top of responses to multiple environmental stressors, chronic stress impacts may occur. Despite common knowledge of the negative effects of stress, however, it is rare that stress management is considered in conservation, except in intensive ex situ situations such as in captive breeding facilities or zoos. We propose that mitigation of stress impacts on wildlife is crucial for preserving biodiversity, especially as the value of habitats within urban areas increases. As such, we highlight the need for future studies to consider fear and stress in predator-prey ecology to preserve both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, especially in areas where human disturbance occurs. We suggest, in particular, that non-invasive in situ investigations of endocrinology and ethology be partnered in conservation planning with surveys of habitat resources to incorporate and reduce the effects of fear and stress on wildlife.","[Fardell, Loren L.; Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pavey, Chris R.] CSIRO, Land & Water, Winnellie, NT, Australia",,"Fardell, LL (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",lfar3796@uni.sydney.edu.au,"Pavey, Chris/AAT-6315-2020; Pavey, Chris/D-7209-2011","Pavey, Chris/0000-0003-2162-8019; Fardell, Loren/0000-0002-8090-854X; Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730",Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment,"This work was supported by a Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment.

Predator threats change across an animal's lifetime, as do abilities that enable the animal to learn or engage in different defensive behaviors. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the combination of factors that successfully induce unlearned fear to predator odor across development. Infant, juvenile, adolescent, and adult rats were exposed to one of the three odor stimuli (control odor, cat urine, or cat fur) in either a small or large chamber. Though all ages displayed fear-related behavior to cat odors, differences were reflected only in freezing behavior and not, as expected, risk-assessment. Infant and juvenile animals also increased freezing to cat urine compared to the control odor, possibly because these age groups possess limited defensive options to cope with threat and so may respond with freezing to all predator stimuli. Unexpectedly, chamber size had no effect on either freezing or risk-assessment in this study. Once the parameters of unconditioned fear are understood, they can be exploited to develop a learning paradigm to predator odors that could be used in early life. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although studying ungulate ecology of fear is common, knowledge from ungulate systems is highly contested among ecologists. Here, we review the available literature on the ecology of fear in ungulates to generalize our current knowledge and how we can leverage it for conservation. Four general focus areas emerged from the 275 papers included in our literature search (and some papers were included in multiple categories): behavioral responses to predation risk (79%), physiological responses to predation risk (15%), trophic cascades resulting from ungulate responses to predation risk (20%), and manipulation of predation risk (1%). Of papers focused on behavior, 75% were about movement and habitat selection. Studies were biased toward North America (53%), tended to be focused on elk (Cervus canadensis; 29%), and were dominated by gray wolves (40%) or humans (39%) as predators of interest. Emerging literature suggests that we can utilize predation risk for conservation with top-down (i.e., increasing predation risk) and bottom-up (i.e., manipulating landscape characteristics to increase risk or risk perception) approaches. It is less clear whether fear-related changes in physiology have population-level fitness consequences or cascading effects, which could be fruitful avenues for future research. Conflicting evidence of trait-mediated trophic cascades might be improved with better replication across systems and accounting for confounding effects of ungulate density. Improving our understanding of mechanisms modulating the nature of trophic cascades likely is most important to ensure desirable conservation outcomes. We recommend future work embrace the complexity of natural systems by attempting to link together the focal areas of study identified herein.","[Chitwood, M.

Recently, a number of studies started to investigate methods with which fear responses may be induced reliably in zebrafish. The ultimate goal of these studies has been to develop zebrafish models of pathological processes and to investigate the mechanisms of fear and to eventually translate the findings to the human clinic. Previously, animated image of a sympatric predator of zebrafish was shown to induce fear responses. Here we expand on this recently gained knowledge and investigate whether other moving images may induce more robust fear responses. The images investigated include the original sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish, another sympatric predator, the needle fish, a bird silhouette moved on the side or above the tank, an expanding dot mimicking rapid approach of an object shown on the side and from above the tank, as well as non-fear inducing images including a single and a group of zebrafish. Our results indicate that although the sympatric predators do induce some fear responses, the other images, particularly the expanding dot but also the bird silhouette shown from above are more effective. The results also reveal a stimulus dependent motor pattern response repertoire of zebrafish demonstrating that perhaps univariate quantification methods may not be appropriate for uncovering the complexity of fear or anxiety related phenotypical changes in this species.

However, the downstream neural circuits that mediate these fear responses differ according to the nature of the threat, with separate pathways having been identified for predator, conspecific and physically harmful threats. In particular, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VHMdm) is critical for the expression of defensive responses to predators. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this circuit also participates in predator fear memory by transient pharmacogenetic inhibition of the VMHdm and its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, during predator fear learning in the mouse. Our data demonstrate that neural activity in the VMHdm is required for both the acquisition and recall of predator fear memory, whereas that of its downstream effector, the dorsal periaqueductal grey, is required only for the acute expression of fear. These findings are consistent with a role for the medial hypothalamus in encoding an internal emotional state of fear.","[Silva, Bianca A.; Mattucci, Camilla; Krzywkowski, Piotr; Cuozzo, Rachel; Carbonari, Laura; Gross, Cornelius T.] European Mol Biol Lab, Mouse Biol Unit, Via Ramarini 32, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy",,"Gross, CT (corresponding author), European Mol Biol Lab, Mouse Biol Unit, Via Ramarini 32, I-00015 Monterotondo, Italy.",gross@embl.it,"Silva, Bianca Ambrogina/AAE-3354-2020","Silva, Bianca Ambrogina/0000-0003-3877-1356",US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH093887-01]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-2013-ADG 341139]; EMBL; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH093887] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank F.

Mere presence has been found to reduce vigilance. However, animal research has also shown that chemosignals (e.g., sweat) produced during fear-inducing situations modulate individuals' threat detection strategies. In the case of humans, little is known about how exposure to conspecifics' fear chemosignals modulates vigilance and threat detection effectiveness. This study (N = 59) examined how human fear chemosignals affect vigilance strategies and threat avoidance in its receivers. We relied on a paradigm that simulates a foraging under threat situation in the lab, integrated with an eye-tracker to examine the attention allocation. Our results showed that the exposure to fear chemosignals (vs. rest chemosignals and a no-sweat condition) while not changing vigilance behavior leads to faster answers to threatening events. In conclusion, fear chemosignals seem to constitute an important warning signal for human beings, possibly leading their receiver to a readiness state that allows faster reactions to threat-related events.","[Gomes, Nuno; Semin, Gun R.] ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Semin, Gun R.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Semin, GR (corresponding author), ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal.",gun.r.semin@gmail.com,"Semin, Gun/J-4046-2013","Semin, Gun/0000-0002-5304-5566; Gomes, Nuno/0000-0002-0545-607X","Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/116653/2016, IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001]; European UnionEuropean Commission [824153]","This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [grant number: SFRH/BD/116653/2016 to NG, and grant number: IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001 to GRS].

These changes are occurring at scales ranging from global to local and across variable temporal scales. Indirect, risk-based effects of human activity are known to be important in structuring some terrestrial ecosystems, but these impacts have largely been neglected in oceans. Here, we synthesize existing literature and data to explore multiple lines of evidence that collectively suggest diverse human activities are changing marine ecosystems, including carbon storage capacity, in myriad ways by altering predation risk. We provide novel, compelling evidence that at least one key human activity, overfishing, can lead to distinct, cascading risk effects in natural ecosystems whose magnitude exceeds that of presumed lethal effects and may account for previously unexplained findings. We further discuss the conservation implications of human-caused indirect risk effects. Finally, we provide a predictive framework for when human alterations of risk in oceans should lead to cascading effects and outline a prospectus for future research. Given the speed and extent with which human activities are altering marine risk landscapes, it is crucial that conservation and management policy considers the indirect effects of these activities in order to increase the likelihood of success and avoid unfortunate surprises.","[Madin, Elizabeth M.

They might serve as dual-purpose and robust strains that have advantageous behaviors, such as exploration and reduced fear reactions, which might support animal welfare in general. Therefore, it is important to characterize welfare-related behaviors, such as fear and exploration, and to identify these behavioral traits among the diversity of chicken strains. The aim of this study was to characterize fear reactions and exploration based on the avoidance of a novel object and the avoidance of a human in three different chicken strains. To identify interesting alternatives for future poultry production, a layer hybrid (Lohmann Brown), a dual-purpose hybrid (Lohmann Dual) and a locally adapted strain (Rhinelander) were tested for their fear and exploration behavior towards unknown objects and humans. Results showed clear differences in fear and exploration between all three strains, regarding fear of objects and humans. The strain-specific results illustrate the high diversity of behavioral traits. The understanding of behavioral diversity, including fear and exploration, might contribute substantially to future breeding programs, including of commercial strains, and the preservation of local strains in general, which can improve animal welfare on a genetic and individual basis. Fear and exploration are crucial traits determining how animals behave in novel situations, and thus, they influence animal welfare. The aim of this study was the characterization of these behavioral traits among different strains to identify interesting alternatives for future poultry production. Whereas the Novel Object Test (NOT) focuses on fear and exploration of novel objects, the Avoidance Distance Test (ADT) addresses this in the context of humans. Here, a commercial hybrid line, a dual-purpose hybrid and a local adapted strain were tested. For the differences between strains and development of fear, Lohmann Brown (n = 714), Lohmann Dual (n = 844) and Rhinelander (n = 458) were observed weekly until maturity. Results show that fear and exploration towards unknown objects and humans are breed-specific (all p < 0.01). Additionally, development of fear in NOT and ADT differed between all three strains (both p < 0.01). The expressions of fear of humans or objects should be regarded as characteristics adapted for different husbandry systems and breeding goals, e.g., high exploratory behavior in aviary or high avoidance of predators in free-ranging husbandry or at least a balanced ratio between fear and exploration. Characterization of behavioral traits among different strains, understanding diversity and integrating these behaviors into future breeding and husbandry systems might reflect the need to preserve local strains and the potential to improve animal welfare.","[Meuser, Verena; Hillemacher, Sonja; Tiemann, Inga] Univ Bonn, Inst Agr Engn, Agr Fac, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Weinhold, Leonie] Univ Hosp Bonn, Inst Med Biometry Informat & Epidemiol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Tiemann, Inga] Univ Bonn, Inst Anim Sci, Agr Fac, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",,"Meuser, V (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Agr Engn, Agr Fac, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",verena.meuser@uni-bonn.de; weinhold@imbie.meb.uni-bonn.de; sonja.hillemacher@uni-bonn.de; inga.tiemann@uni-bonn.de,"Weinhold, Leonie/ABE-6091-2021","Tiemann, Inga/0000-0002-3607-4453","Ministry for Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia [17-02.04.01-05/2018]","Part of this research (development observations) was funded by the Ministry for Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, grant number 17-02.04.01-05/2018.",,47,1,1,9,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAR,2021,11,3,,,,,,,679,10.3390/ani11030679,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,RD1BB,WOS:000633221600001,33806293,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-19,

An unintended consequence is the strong modulation of the three-way interaction involving people, predators and prey, a dynamic that questions the extent to which animal distributions and interactions are independent of subtle human influences. Here, I capitalize on the remarkable 9-day synchronicity in which 90% of moose neonates in the Yellow-stone Ecosystem are born, to demonstrate a substantive change in how prey avoid predators; birth sites shift away from traffic-averse brown bears and towards paved roads. The decade-long modification was associated with carnivore recolonization, but neither mothers in bear-free areas nor non-parous females altered patterns of landscape use. These findings offer rigorous support that mammals use humans to shield against carnivores and raise the possibility that redistribution has occurred in other mammalian taxa due to human presence in ways we have yet to anticipate. To interpret ecologically functioning systems within parks, we must now also account for indirect anthropogenic effects on species distributions and behaviour.","Wildlife Conservat Soc, N Amer Program, Teton Valley, ID 83455 USA; Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",,"Berger, J (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, N Amer Program, Teton Valley, ID 83455 USA.",j.berger@wcs.org,,,,,,27,235,239,6,154,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

Extensive research has examined the consequences of predation risk from large carnivores on the behavior of wild ungulate prey species. However, many large carnivores not only hunt wild prey but also depredate domestic livestock, especially in pastoralist systems where livestock share land and resources with large carnivores. Northern Tanzania is a hotspot for human-carnivore conflict driven by livestock depredation and interactions are particularly severe between African lions Panthera leo and pastoralist cattle Bos taurus. In this ecosystem, we explored the degree to which pastoralist cattle exhibited anti-predator behaviors during their daily grazing routines. Using focal animal sampling, we compared two typical anti-predator behaviors, vigilance and grouping, among cattle in village rangelands with high and low background depredation rates. We found that cattle in high risk village rangelands formed 21.2% larger groups than cattle in low risk village rangelands. Interestingly, cattle in low risk village rangelands spent 68.4% more time vigilant than cattle in high risk village rangelands. These patterns were influenced significantly by the time of day: as sunset approached, cattle in low risk village rangelands spent more time vigilant and cattle in high risk village rangelands formed larger groups. These results suggest that pastoralist cattle exhibit anti-predator strategies that vary both spatially and temporally, and that such strategies might help livestock optimally tradeoff the costs and benefits of anti-predator behavior across timescales (i.e. the risk allocation hypothesis). We discuss the implications of our results for husbandry techniques that might reduce behavioral costs associated with cattle anti-predator behaviors and help increase tolerance for lions and other large carnivores. These improvements are critical to human-carnivore coexistence given the prevalence of pastoralism globally and the rising potential for conflict with large carnivores such as lions.","[Beck, Jacalyn M.; Montgomery, Robert A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Res Ecol Carnivores & Their Prey Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Moll, Remington J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Kissui, Bernard M.] Sch Field Studies, Ctr Wildlife Management Studies, Karatu, Tanzania",,"Beck, JM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Res Ecol Carnivores & Their Prey Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",beckjaca@msu.edu,"; Montgomery, Robert A./C-5541-2019","Beck, Jacalyn/0000-0001-9095-5465; Montgomery, Robert A./0000-0001-5894-0589",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF); Tanzanian Partnership Program at Michigan State University,This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program as well as the Tanzanian Partnership Program at Michigan State University.,,83,0,0,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,2021,130,3,,,,,422,430,,10.1111/oik.07965,,DEC 2020,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QP5ZY,WOS:000600523300001,,,,,2022-04-19,

This can be studied in risk perception during movement in relation to specific habitat types, whereby individuals trade-off between foraging and disturbance. Due to its high behavioral plasticity and increasing occurrence in urban environments, wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an excellent model organism to study adjustment to urbanization. With the help of GPS tracking, space use of 11 wild boar from Berlin's metropolitan region was analyzed: we aimed at understanding how animals adjust space use to deal with the landscape of fear in urban areas compared to rural areas. We compared use vs. availability with help of generalized linear mixed models. First, we studied landscape types selected by rural vs. urban wild boar, second, we analyzed distances of wild boar locations to each of the landscape types. Finally, we mapped the resulting habitat selection probability to predict hotspots of human-wildlife conflicts. A higher tolerance to disturbance in urban wild boar was shown by a one third shorter flight distance and by an increased re-use of areas close to the trap. Urban wild boar had a strong preference for natural landscapes such as swamp areas, green areas and deciduous forests, and areas with high primary productivity, as indicated by high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) values. The areas selected by urban wild boar were often located closely to roads and houses. The spatial distribution maps show that a large area of Berlin would be suitable for urban wild boar but not their rural conspecifics, with the most likely reason being a different perception of anthropogenic disturbance. Wild boar therefore showed considerable behavioral plasticity suitable to adjust to human-dominated environments in a potentially evolutionarily adaptive manner.","[Stillfried, Milena; Gras, Pierre; Boerner, Konstantin; Wenzler, Moritz; Hofer, Heribert; Ortmann, Sylvia; Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Gras, Pierre] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, Berlin, Germany; [Goeritz, Frank; Painer, Johanna; Roellig, Kathleen] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Reprod Management, Berlin, Germany; [Wenzler, Moritz] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Berlin, Germany",,"Stillfried, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany.",stillfried@izw-berlin.de,"Ortmann, Sylvia/B-7088-2015; Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/A-8778-2013; Hofer, Heribert/AAF-7854-2021; Gras, Pierre/E-4398-2016","Ortmann, Sylvia/0000-0003-2520-6251; Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/0000-0002-9269-4446; Hofer, Heribert/0000-0002-2813-7442; Painer - Gigler, Johanna/0000-0003-3929-511X; Gras, Pierre/0000-0002-4269-0770",Stiftung Naturschutz; Leibniz Institute for Zoo & Wildlife Research; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research BMBF within the Collaborative Project Bridging in Biodiversity Science-BIBS [01LC1501A-H]; Leibniz Association,"We thank Andreas Burchardt, Andreas Constien, Egbert Gleich, Erica Grant, Bodo Janitza, Uwe Peschke, Marion Schmolke, and Heiko Wessendorf for their help with trapping wild boar, the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) and Hinrich Zoller (University of Rostock) for providing traps, Anne Berger and Knut Eichhorn for the use of telemetry devices, Matthias Busch, and Ilja Heckmann for assistance with data analyses and National Geographic, the Stiftung Naturschutz and the Leibniz Institute for Zoo & Wildlife Research for funding.

To date few studies have assessed the spatiotemporal trade-off between resource acquisition and avoidance of risks and human disturbance in small protected areas embedded in an urban matrix. A better understanding of the forage-safety trade-off in urban protected areas (UPA) is key to the design of evidence based approaches to deal with the ever-increasing human-wildlife impacts typical of UPA. Herein, we analyzed camera trap data to evaluate how two ungulate species trade fear for food in a 60 km(2) human-dominated UPA without natural predators. We found that wild boar (Sus scrofa) were predominantly active at night, while roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) showed a typical bimodal crepuscular activity pattern. Occupancy analysis indicated that deciduous forest and the presence of high seats for hunting played an important role in determining the space use of wild boar. For roe deer, we found indications that the presence of forest influenced space use, although the null model was retained among the top ranked models. Our results confirm that wild boar and roe deer are able to thrive in heavily human dominated landscapes characterized by intensive recreational use and hunting, such as protected areas embedded in an urban matrix.

Different tactics such as ambush, stalking, and pursuit may lead to spatially heterogeneous distributions of predation risk. Studying how such a landscape of risk looks in a multi-predator setting has become topical in light of the re-colonization of apex predators in areas with extensive human harvesting. The human hunter is likely to adapt hunting tactics to increase encounter rate and hunting success, but is also limited by time constraints, light conditions, legislation, tradition, and/or skills. The extent to which hunters vary tactics resulting in a spatial pattern of risk to ungulate prey has never been quantified. By comparing habitat characteristics between kill sites and sites used by GPS-marked roe deer, we quantified the landscape of risk as experienced by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) exposed to predation by both Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and humans using different hunting tactics in southeastern Norway. Lynx killed roe deer in denser habitat than roe deer used on average, while humans killed most roe deer in open terrain. However, humans used multiple hunting tactics, and habitat characteristics varied predictably between drive hunts conducted with rifle versus shotgun, and between stalking versus sit and wait hunts with a rifle. Vegetation density was higher where roe deer were shot during drive hunts with a shotgun and during stalking than when shot during drive hunting with a rifle or during sit and wait hunts. Shooting distance was shortest for drive hunts with a shotgun, similar for drive hunts with a rifle and stalking, and considerably longer during sit and wait hunting. Managers therefore have the possibility to create different risk landscapes by restricting types of weapons and types of hunting tactic allowed, also in combination with the duration of the hunting season.","[Norum, Jorgen Kvernhaugen; Mysterud, Atle] Univ Oslo, CEES, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway; [Lone, Karen; Loe, Leif Egil] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway; [Linnell, John D.

While these effects have been attributed to ASIC1A in neurons, it has been reported that ASICs may also function in nonneuronal cells. To determine if ASIC1A in neurons is indeed required, we generated neuron-specific knockout (KO) mice with floxed Asic1a alleles disrupted by Cre recombinase driven by the neuron-specific synapsin I promoter (SynAsic1a KO mice). We confirmed that Cre expression occurred in neurons, but not all neurons, and not in nonneuronal cells including astrocytes. Consequent loss of ASIC1A in some but not all neurons was verified by western blotting, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. We found ASIC1A was disrupted in fear circuit neurons, and SynAsic1a KO mice exhibited prominent deficits in multiple fear-related behaviors including Pavlovian fear conditioning to cue and context, predator odor-evoked freezing and freezing responses to carbon dioxide inhalation. In contrast, in the nucleus accumbens ASIC1A expression was relatively normal in SynAsic1a KO mice, and consistent with this observation, cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) was normal. Interestingly, depression-related behavior in the forced swim test, which has been previously linked to ASIC1A in the amygdala, was also normal. Together, these data suggest neurons are an important site of ASIC1A action in fear-related behaviors, whereas other behaviors likely depend on ASIC1A in other neurons or cell types not targeted in SynAsic1a KO mice. These findings highlight the need for further work to discern the roles of ASICs in specific cell types and brain sites.","[Taugher, R. J.; Lu, Y.; Fan, R.; Ghobbeh, A.; Wemmie, J.

Consequently, large carnivores avoid humans, but may use human-dominated landscapes by being nocturnal and elusive. Behavioral studies indicate that certain ecological systems are landscapes of fear, driven by antipredator behavior. Because behavior and physiology are closely interrelated, physiological assessments may provide insight into the behavioral response of large carnivores to human activity. To elucidate changes in brown bears' (Ursus arctos) behavior associated with human activity, we evaluated stress as changes in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in 12 GPS-collared, free-ranging bears, 7 males and 5 females, 3-11 years old, using cardiac-monitoring devices. We applied generalized linear regression models with HR and HRV as response variables and chest activity, time of day, season, distance traveled, and distance to human settlements from GPS positions recorded every 30 mm as potential explanatory variables. Bears exhibited lower HRV, an indication of stress, when they were close to human settlements and especially during the berry season, when humans were more often in the forest, picking berries and hunting. Our findings provide evidence of a human-induced landscape of fear in this hunted population of brown bears. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Subsequent to the return of large carnivores to human-modified ecosystems, many prey species have adjusted their spatial behaviour to the contrasting landscapes of fear generated by both their natural predators and anthropogenic pressures. The effects of predation risk on temporal shifts in diel activity of prey, however, remain largely unexplored in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the influence of the density of lynx Lynx lynx, a nocturnal predator, on the diel activity patterns of their main prey, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus, across a gradient of human disturbance and hunting at the European scale. Based on 11 million activity records from 431 individually GPS-monitored roe deer in 12 populations within the EURODEER network (), we investigated how lynx predation risk in combination with both lethal and non-lethal human activities affected the diurnality of deer. We demonstrated marked plasticity in roe deer diel activity patterns in response to spatio-temporal variations in risk, mostly due to human activities. In particular, roe deer decreased their level of diurnality by a factor of 1.37 when the background level of general human disturbance was high. Hunting exacerbated this effect, as during the hunting season deer switched most of their activity to night-time and, to a lesser extent, to dawn, although this pattern varied noticeably in relation to lynx density. Indeed, in the presence of lynx, their main natural predator, roe deer were relatively more diurnal. Overall, our results revealed a strong influence of human activities and the presence of lynx on diel shifts in roe deer activity. In the context of the recovery of large carnivores across Europe, we provide important insights about the effects of predators on the behavioural responses of their prey in human-dominated ecosystems. Modifications in the temporal partitioning of ungulate activity as a response to human activities may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence, but likely also have knock-on effects for predator-prey interactions, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.","[Bonnot, Nadege; Kjellander, Petter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Bonnot, Nadege] Irstea, UR EFNO, Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; [Couriot, Ophelie; Morellet, Nicolas; Hewison, Aidan J.

Female rats in different phases of the cycle were exposed to an innate fear-inducing stimulus (2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, TMT odor) and monitored for changes in behavior and brain activation. Behavioral data showed freezing responses to TMT were significantly enhanced during estrus as compared to other phases of the cycle. This data was supported by significant increases in pixel intensity in cortical and sub-cortical regions in estrus compared to proestrus and diestrus. Imaging results demonstrated significant increases in brain activation in the somatosensory and insular cortices when comparing estrus to diestrus. There were significant increases in neural activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) and septum in estrus as compared to proestrus. Additionally, the hippocampus, hypothalamus, olfactory system, and cingulate cortex show significant increases in the estrus phase when compared to both diestrus and proestrus. Taken together, these results suggest that the female's hormonal status may be correlated with alterations in both neuronal and behavioral indices of fear. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This risk can derive from natural predators and also from direct and indirect human pressures. A starving forager will often take risks that a less hungry forager would not. At a highly seasonal and human-modified site, we predicted that arboreal samango monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis labiatus) would show highly flexible, responsive, risk-sensitive foraging. We first determined how monkeys use horizontal and vertical space across seasons to evaluate if high-risk decisions (use of gardens and ground) changed with season, a proxy for starvation risk. Then, during a subsequent winter, we offered equal feeding opportunities (in the form of high-value, raw peanuts) in both gardens and forest to see if this short-term change in food availability and starvation risk affected monkeys' foraging decisions. We found that during the food-scarce winter, monkeys foraged outside indigenous forest and in gardens, where they fed on exotic species, especially fallen acorns (Quercus spp.), despite potential threats from humans. Nevertheless, and as predicted, when given the choice of foraging on high-value foods in gardens vs. forest during our artificial foraging experiment, monkeys showed a preference for a safer forest habitat. Our experiment also indicated monkeys' sensitivity to risk in the lower vertical strata of both habitats, despite their previous extensive use of the ground. Our findings support one of the central tenets of optimal foraging theory: that risk of starvation and sensitivity to the variation in food availability can be as important drivers of behavior as risk of predation.","[Nowak, Katarzyna; Hill, Russell A.] Univ Durham, Evolutionary Anthropol Res Grp, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Nowak, Katarzyna; le Roux, Aliza] Univ Free State, Zool & Entomol, Qwaqwa Campus, ZA-9866 Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa; [Wimberger, Kirsten] Univ Cape Town, Biol Sci, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Richards, Shane A.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia",,"Nowak, K (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Evolutionary Anthropol Res Grp, Durham DH1 3LE, England.; Nowak, K (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Zool & Entomol, Qwaqwa Campus, ZA-9866 Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa.",knowak02@gmail.com,"Nowak, Katarzyna/AAT-5468-2021; le Roux, Aliza/Y-3541-2019; Hill, Russell/D-9113-2013","Hill, Russell/0000-0002-7601-5802; Wimberger, Kirsten/0000-0002-8420-0987; Nowak, Katarzyna/0000-0002-4992-7910; Richards, Shane/0000-0002-9638-5827; le Roux, Aliza/0000-0002-9869-2580",Durham University COFUND; RW Primate Fund; University of the Free State; Claude Leon Foundation; UCT URC Fellowship; JMasters NRF Fund; Novartis SAVF Wildlife Research Fund; Primate Conservation Inc.; Mazda Wildlife Fund,"We thank Alison Midgley, Nthabiseng Mathibane, Diana Breshears, Steve Boyes, and Adrian Tordiffe for their assistance in the field.

The aim of this study was to determine how the risks of predation and heat stress influenced their behavior while feeding on a key food, fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata). Materials and Methods: Proximity of fruiting baobab trees to anthropogenic landmarks were compared to food intake, feeding rate, and behavioral indicators of fear in adult males (N = 11) at Fongoli. Additionally, we compared foraging to vegetative habitats, baobab ripe fruit nutritive quality, surface water availability, and foraging party composition. Results: Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead, risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of heat stress. Conclusions: Adaptations that minimize predation risk are widespread in mammalian prey species, but these traits are poorly understood in chimpanzees. Great apes encounter few nonhuman predators capable of successfully capturing and killing them; thus, such events are rarely observed. Although people rarely hunt chimpanzees in Senegal, we found that adult males perceived humans as predators and adjusted their behavior while foraging in risky habitats. From an applied perspective, risk-taking behavior is important for understanding and mitigating the problem of crop-feeding in locations where chimpanzees and humans live in sympatry.","[Lindshield, Stacy; Pruetz, Jill D.] Iowa State Univ, Dept World Languages & Cultures, 324 Curtiss Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lindshield, Stacy; Danielson, Brent J.; Pruetz, Jill D.] Iowa State Univ, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Program, Ames, IA USA; [Danielson, Brent J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA USA; [Rothman, Jessica M.] Hunter Coll CUNY, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Rothman, Jessica M.] New York Consortium Evolutionary Primatol, New York, NY USA",,"Lindshield, S (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept World Languages & Cultures, 324 Curtiss Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",slind@iastate.edu,,"Pruetz, Jill/0000-0002-9151-8571",Leakey Foundation; Rufford Foundation; Iowa State University; CUNY-Hunter College,Leakey Foundation; Rufford Foundation; Iowa State University; CUNY-Hunter College,,100,21,21,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9483,1096-8644,,AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL,Am.

The BNST is important for contextual fear learning, but the mechanisms regulating this function remain unclear. One candidate mechanism is corticotropin-releasing-factor (CRF) acting at CRF type 1 receptors (CRFr1s). Yet, there has been little progress in elucidating if CRFr1s in the BNST are involved in different types of fear (conditioned and/or unconditioned). Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of antalarmin, a potent CRFr1 receptor antagonist, injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) and into the dorsolateral BNST (LBNST) during single trial contextual fear conditioning or exposure to the predator odor 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT). Neither ICV nor LBNST antalarmin disrupted unconditioned freezing to TMT. In contrast, ICV and LBNST antalarmin disrupted the retention of contextual fear when tested 24 h later. Neither ICV nor LBNST antalarmin affected baseline or post-shock freezing indicating antalarmin does not interfere with the early phases of contextual fear acquisition. Antalarmin did not (1) permanently affect the ability to learn and express contextual fear, (2) change responsivity to footshocks, or (3) affect the ability to freeze. Our findings highlight an important role for CRFr1s within the LBNST during contextually conditioned fear, but not unconditioned predator odor fear. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These behaviors may in turn be altered by human influences such as defaunation. Herein, we evaluate whether frugivores avoid areas with high visitation rates by potential predators or competitors, and whether this avoidance changes in areas with different degrees of defaunation. We installed 189 cameras under fruit trees in six areas of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, that differ in the abundance of top predators and large frugivores. Small predators and small frugivores were more frequent at night while large frugivores were more frequent during the day, but small frugivores visited and spent less time at fruiting trees on brighter nights, unlike large predators and large frugivores. Small frugivores also were less frequent in areas with high visitation by large frugivores and more frequent in highly defaunated areas. Our results suggest that the dynamics among mammalian functional groups varied according to die! patterns, potential competitors, and defaunation. We highlight the importance of understanding how species interactions are changing in areas exposed to strong human impacts to mitigate the indirect effects of defaunation.","[Carreira, Daiane Cristina] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz Queiroz, Programa Interunidades Pos Grad Ecol Aplicada, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Carreira, Daiane Cristina] Fdn Herminio Ometto Uniararas, BR-13607339 Araras, SP, Brazil; [Brodie, Jedediah F.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Brodie, Jedediah F.] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Mendes, Calebe P.; Galetti, Mauro] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Ferraz, Katia Maria P.

When hunted, however, they may have to adjust their behaviour further or differently to cope with this additional mortality risk. Here, we investigated whether African large ungulates would adjust their behaviour in response to hunting risk (i.e. risk of being shot by human hunters). We predicted that they would shift their use of surface water, a key and scarce resource in African savannas, from day hours to night hours to reduce the risk of encountering human hunters. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to record the temporal drinking niche of three nonhunted ungulates (i.e. impala, Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, sable antelope, Hippotragus niger). We also monitored waterholes in hunting areas in the vicinity of Hwange National Park. In Hwange National Park, the three species avoided waterholes at night, when the risk of natural predation was higher. Conversely, in the hunting areas, all three species visited waterholes more often at night. Impala and greater kudu, however, were less prone to switch towards night-time use of waterholes in hunting areas compared to sable antelope, although all three species were exposed to similar hunting risk. Our results suggest that hunting may force African ungulates to shift their visits at waterholes from day hours towards night hours, but that the magnitude of this shift may be constrained by the predation risk imposed by large nocturnal carnivores. We conclude that species preyed upon by natural predators adjust their antipredator behaviour in response to the additional risk of predation imposed by hunting.

We have proposed a model where different defensive responses are organized along a predatory imminence continuum (PIC). The PIC is a behavior system organized as a sequence of innately programmed behavioral modes, each representing a different interaction with the predator or threat. Ranging from low threat to predator contact, the PIC categorizes defense modes as pre-encounter, post-encounter, and circa-strike, corresponding to states of anxiety, fear, and panic, respectively. This experiment examined if the same significant stressor caused overexpression of all defensive responses along the PIC, including anxiety-like behavior, freezing, and panic-like responses. Female and male mice were exposed to acute stress that consisted of a series of ten pseudorandomly presented unsignaled footshocks (or no shocks). Mice were subsequently tested on a battery of tasks to assess stress effects on pre-encounter (anxiety-like), post-encounter (fear), and circa-strike (panic-like) behaviors. Results revealed that following stress, mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior shown through reduced average velocity within a modified open field. Furthermore, stressed mice showed increased fear following a single footshock in a new context as well as an increase in reactivity to white noise in the original stress context, with stressed mice exhibiting a more robust circa-strike-like response than controls. Therefore, significant stress exposure influenced the defensive states of anxiety, fear, and panic across the predatory imminence continuum. This research could therefore reveal how such responses become maladaptive following traumatic stress in humans.","[Hoffman, Ann N.; Trott, Jeremy M.; Makridis, Anna; Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hoffman, Ann N.; Trott, Jeremy M.; Fanselow, Michael S.] Staglin Ctr Brain & Behav Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Hoffman, Ann N.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",,"Hoffman, AN (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Hoffman, AN (corresponding author), Staglin Ctr Brain & Behav Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.; Hoffman, AN (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",hoffmana7@gmail.com,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1543-4494,1543-4508,,LEARN BEHAV,Learn Behav.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.3758/s13420-021-00509-x,,FEB 2022,10,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Psychology, Experimental; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,YR4EZ,WOS:000749946700002,35112315,hybrid,,,2022-04-19,

However, humans can be unpredictable predators and anthropogenic cues that animals perceive may not be reliable indicators of the risk of being killed. In these cases, animal fear responses may be ineffective and may even exacerbate the risk of anthropogenic mortality. Here, we explore these questions using a 10-year dataset of movement and mortality events for the puma Puma concolor population in the fragmented Santa Cruz Mountains of California, for whom the leading cause of death was retaliatory killings by people following livestock loss. We modeled retaliatory killing risk and puma habitat selection relative to residential housing density to evaluate whether puma avoidance of human cues reflected their risk of being killed. We documented a mismatch between human cues, fear responses and actual risk. Rather than scaling directly with housing density, retaliatory killings occurred at intermediate levels of human development and at night. Pumas avoided these areas during the day but selected for these high-risk areas at night, resulting in a mismatch between cue and risk impacting 17% of the study area. These results are unlikely to be driven by puma hunting behavior: livestock constitute a very small proportion of puma diets, and we found no evidence for the alternative hypothesis that state-dependent foraging drove depredation of livestock and subsequent retaliatory killings. Our findings indicate that puma responses to human cues are not sufficient to enable human-carnivore coexistence in this area and suggest that reducing risk from humans in places with few perceptible human cues would facilitate carnivore conservation in human-dominated landscapes. Furthermore, a mismatch between human cues and responses by carnivores can lead to selection rather than avoidance of risky areas, which could result in an ecological trap.","[Nisi, Anna C.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Nisi, Anna C.] Univ Washington, Biol Dept, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Benson, John F.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Nisi, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",nisianna@gmail.com,,"Nisi, Anna/0000-0003-0286-3187","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0963022, 1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Peninsula Open Space Trust",This work was funded by NSF grants 0963022 and 1255913 and by the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Peninsula Open Space Trust.,,66,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,,,,,,,,,,,e09051,10.1111/oik.09051,,MAR 2022,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZZ8GM,WOS:000773503100001,,hybrid,,,2022-04-19,

A deterrent that capitalizes on learning mechanisms, like fear conditioning, may enhance success while simultaneously balancing welfare concerns and reduce noise pollution. During fear conditioning, individuals learn the cues that precede the dangerous stimuli, and respond by avoiding the painful situations. We tested the efficacy of fear conditioning using acoustic stimuli for reducing California sea lion Zalophus californianus interactions from two fishing contexts in California, USA; bait barges and recreational fishing vessels. We performed conditioning trials on 24 individual sea lions interacting with bait barges. We tested for acquisition of conditioned fear by pairing a neutral tone with a startle stimulus. Avoidance was strongest in response to the startle stimulus alone, but low when paired with a neutral tone. From actively fishing vessels, we tested for fear conditioning by exposing sea lions to a neutral tone followed by a startle pulse, a startle pulse alone or a no sound control. We conducted playbacks from 146 (including 48 no sound control) stops over two summer fishing seasons (2013, 2014). The startle stimulus decreased surfacing frequency, reduced bait foraging and increased surfacing distance from the vessel while the conditioned stimulus only caused a mild reduction in surfacing frequency with no other behavioral change. Exposing animals to a pair of a conditioned stimulus with a startle pulse did not achieve the intended management outcome. Rather, it generated evidence (in two study contexts) of immediate learning that led to the reduction of the unconditioned response. Taken together, our results suggest that for fear conditioning to be applied as a non-lethal deterrent, careful consideration has to be given to individual behavior, the unconditioned/conditioned responses and the overall management goals.","[Schakner, Zachary A.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gotz, Thomas; Janik, Vincent M.] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",,"Schakner, ZA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",zschakner@ucla.edu,,"Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244; Gotz, Thomas/0000-0002-4630-3328; Janik, Vincent/0000-0001-7894-0121; schakner, zachary/0000-0002-8325-3526",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); LaKretz Center for California Conservation Science; Sportfishing Association of California; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1557130] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [smru10001] Funding Source: researchfish,"Z.S. was supported by a NSF predoctoral fellowship and by a grant from the LaKretz Center for California Conservation Science.

Research on emotion was pioneered by Darwin's work on emotional expressions in humans and animals. But Darwin was concerned mainly with facial and bodily expressions of significance for humans, citing mainly examples from mammals (e.g., apes, dogs, and cats). In birds, emotional expressions are less evident for a human observer, so a different approach is needed. Understanding avian emotions will provide key evolutionary information on the evolution of related behaviors and brain circuitry. Birds and mammals are thought to have evolved from different groups of Mesozoic reptiles, theropod dinosaurs and therapsids, respectively, and therefore, their common ancestor is likely to be a basal reptile living about 300 million years ago, during the Carboniferous or Permian period. Yet, birds and mammals exhibit extensive convergence in terms of relative brain size, high levels of activity, sleep/wakefulness cycles, endothermy, and social behavior, among others. This article focuses on two basic emotions with negative valence: fear and frustration. Fear is related to the anticipation of dangerous or threatening stimuli (e.g., predators or aggressive conspecifics). Frustration is related to unexpected reward omissions or devaluations (e.g., loss of food or sexual resources). These results have implications for an understanding of the conditions that promote fear and frustration and for the evolution of supporting brain circuitry.","[Papini, Mauricio R.] Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Penagos-Corzo, Julio C.] Univ Americas Puebla, Cholula, Mexico; [Perez-Acosta, Andres M.] Univ Rosario, Bogota, Colombia",,"Papini, MR (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.; Penagos-Corzo, JC (corresponding author), Univ Americas Puebla, Cholula, Mexico.; Perez-Acosta, AM (corresponding author), Univ Rosario, Bogota, Colombia.",m.papini@tcu.edu; julioc.penagos@udlap.mx; andres.perez@urosario.edu.co,"Perez-Acosta, Andres M./C-1561-2013","Perez-Acosta, Andres M./0000-0002-1133-8926; Penagos-Corzo, Julio/0000-0002-4879-3033","COLCIENCIASDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias; Universidad del Rosario; Fundacion para el Avance de la Psicologia, Colombia; Programa de Movilidad Internacional de Investigadores e innovadores a Eventos y Estancias de Corta Duracion [395-2007]","AP-A was supported by funds from COLCIENCIAS, Universidad del Rosario, and Fundacion para el Avance de la Psicologia, Colombia.

As a result, it includes recommendations on overcrowding, frequency of cage changes, enrichment, and group housing. However, human odorants are a potential but unexplored source of fear, anxiety, and stress. Although mice have been maintained for decades for animal research, whether mice perceive humans as predators is unknown. If so, this would necessitate changes in animal care and use procedures to minimize this source of chronic fear, anxiety, and stress. Odorants from predator urine are well known to elicit strong fear responses in mice, leading to modification of animal behavior and elevated levels of stress. To begin asking whether human odors influence mouse behavior, we tested the effect of human urine odor on fear response in mice. We assessed mouse behavior by using a modified shuttle cage to record various parameters of mouse exposure to odorants. We found that mice displayed fear responses to 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, a synthetic analog of red fox feces, but no fear response to DMSO, the diluent for 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline.

These traditional paradigms measure a limited selection of variables over a short duration, providing only a snapshot of fear and anxiety-related behavior. Overreliance on these paradigms and such behavioral snapshots ultimately lead to a narrow understanding of these complex motivational states. Here, we elaborate on the closed economy; a seldom-used paradigm that has been modified to comprehensively study fear and anxiety-related behavior and neurocircuitry in rodents. In this modified Risky Closed Economy (RCE) paradigm, animals live nearly uninterrupted in behavioral chambers where the need to acquire food and water and avoid threat is integrated into the task. Briefly, animals are free to acquire all of their food and water in a designated foraging zone. An unsignaled, unpredictable threat (footshock) is introduced into the foraging zone after a baseline activity and consumption period to model the risk of predation, which is then removed for a final extinction assessment. This longitudinal design, wherein data from a multitude of variables are collected automatically and continuously for 23 h/day over several weeks to months, affords a more holistic understanding of the effects of fear and anxiety on day-to-day behavior. Also, we discuss its general benefits relevant to other topics in neuroscience research, its limitations, and present data demonstrating for the first time The Risky Closed Economy's viability in mice.","[Schuessler, Bryan P.; Zambetti, Peter R.; Kukuoka, Kisho M.; Kim, Eun Joo; Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Program Neurosci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Program Neurosci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH099073, AG067008]","This work was funded by National Institutes of Health grant MH099073 [JK, principal investigator (PI)] and AG067008 (EK, PI).",,51,4,4,1,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Little is known, however, about the analogous impacts of humans as perceived top predators on the foraging behaviour of carnivores. Here, we investigate the influence of human-induced fear on puma foraging behaviour using location and prey consumption data from 30 tagged individuals living along a gradient of human development. We observed strong behavioural responses by female pumas to human development, whereby their fidelity to kill sites and overall consumption time of prey declined with increasing housing density by 36 and 42%, respectively. Females responded to this decline in prey consumption time by increasing the number of deer they killed in high housing density areas by 36% over what they killed in areas with little residential development. The loss of food from declines in prey consumption time paired with increases in energetic costs associated with killing more prey may have consequences for puma populations, particularly with regard to reproductive success. In addition, greater carcass availability is likely to alter community dynamics by augmenting food resources for scavengers. In light of the extensive and growing impact of habitat modification, our study emphasizes that knowledge of the indirect effects of human activity on animal behaviour is a necessary component in understanding anthropogenic impacts on community dynamics and food web function.","[Smith, Justine A.; Wang, Yiwei; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Smith, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jsmith5@ucsc.edu,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0963022, 1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Nature Conservancy; Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District; UC Santa Cruz; Felidae Conservation Fund; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0963022] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Funding was provided by NSF grant nos. 0963022 and 1255913, as well as by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, UC Santa Cruz and the Felidae Conservation Fund.",,31,85,85,4,83,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the dorsal hippocampus has been shown to enhance shock-induced contextual fear learning, but it is unknown if HDACs have differential effects along the dorso-ventral hippocampal axis during predator odor fear learning. We injected MS-275, a class I HDAC inhibitor, bilaterally in the dorsal or ventral hippocampus of mice and found that it had no effects on innate anxiety in either region. We then assessed the effects of MS-275 at different stages of fear learning along the longitudinal hippocampal axis. Animals were injected with MS-275 or vehicle after context pre-exposure (pre-conditioning injections), when a representation of the context is first formed, or after exposure to coyote urine (post conditioning injections), when the context becomes associated with predator odor. When MS-275 was administered after context pre-exposure, dorsally injected animals showed enhanced fear in the training context but were able to discriminate it from a neutral environment. Conversely, ventrally injected animals did not display enhanced learning in the training context but generalized the fear response to a neutral context. However, when MS-275 was administered after conditioning, there were no differences between the MS-275 and vehicle control groups in either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus. Surprisingly, all groups displayed generalization to a neutral context, suggesting that predator odor exposure followed by a mild stressor such as restraint leads to fear generalization. These results may elucidate distinct functions of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in predator odor-induced fear conditioning as well as some of the molecular mechanisms underlying fear generalization.","[Yuan, Robin K.; Wann, Ellen G.; Muzzio, Isabel A.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hebert, Jenna C.] Univ Penn, Biol Basis Behav, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Thomas, Arthur S.] Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Muzzio, Isabel A.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Biol, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",,"Muzzio, IA (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Biol, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",isabel.muzzio@utsa.edu,,"Wann, Ellen/0000-0002-2522-0267; Yuan, Robin/0000-0001-5136-9957",National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER awardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1256941]; Ruth L.

In non-urban systems, passerines often respond to predator cues by reducing parental investment, resulting in smaller and lighter nestlings. Since trophic interactions in urban areas are highly altered, it is unclear how passerines respond to fear effects in human-altered landscapes. Nestlings of passerines in urban areas also tend to be smaller and lighter than their rural counterparts and are often exposed to high densities of potential predators yet experience lower per capita predation-the predation paradox. We suggest fear effects in urban habitats could be a significant mechanism influencing nestling condition in birds, despite lowered predation rates. We manipulated exposure of nesting birds to adult-consuming predator risk in residential yards across a gradient of urbanization to determine the relative influence of urbanization and fear on nestling condition. We found nestlings had reduced mass in nests exposed to predator playbacks as well as in more urban areas. Despite lower per capita predation rates in urban areas, fear effects from increased predator densities may influence passerine fitness through reduced nestling condition. As urban development expands, biodiversity conservation hinges on a deeper mechanistic understanding of how urbanization affects reproductive outcomes.","[Grade, Aaron M.] Univ Massachusetts, Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Lerman, Susannah B.] USDA Forest Serv Northern Res Stn, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Warren, Paige S.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,"Grade, AM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",agrade132@gmail.com,,"Lerman, Susannah/0000-0002-2331-8439; Grade, Aaron/0000-0002-5870-4786",,,,70,1,1,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,JUL,2021,12,7,,,,,,,e03665,10.1002/ecs2.3665,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TR1KK,WOS:000678730500024,,gold,,,2022-04-19,

Yet, the consequences of behavioral responses toward human disturbances on vital rates rarely have been investigated. Herein, we assessed the cumulative and instantaneous effects of human disturbances (roads, human settlements, mines and mining exploration) at different temporal scales on the mortality risk of 254 GPS- collared migratory caribou monitored in two herds, the Riviere-aux-Feuilles (RFH) and Riviere-George (RGH) herds, in northern Quebec and Labrador, Canada. We also assessed the relative importance of human disturbances on caribou mortality risk compared with non-anthropogenic factors, including habitat use by caribou, predation risk by gray wolves (Canis lupus), and local weather conditions. Human disturbances alone, exclusive of hunting, had a limited impact on mortality risk of caribou. Repeated exposure to disturbances did not have detectable effects on mortality risk during the early life period (1-7 years old), but more abundant precipitation (RFH) or the use of areas with a higher predation risk (RGH) did so. At the seasonal scale, non-anthropogenic factors, particularly the use of highly selected habitat by caribou and air temperature, had a greater effect than anthropogenic factors on the mortality risk in the RFH. Caribou of the RFH using more frequently higlhy selected habitats decreased their chance of mortality during winter, whereas individuals using warmer areas during summer faced a higher risk of mortality. At the daily scale, we observed that anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors generally had either no effect on the daily risk of mortality, or their effects were undistinguishable from the effect of latitude, with which they were highly correlated. The only exception was for the RFH in winter, for which the daily risk of mortality increased 10 folds for each 10-km increment closer to industrial disturbances. Although the impacts of human disturbances on caribou survival were limited to specific regions and areas, we nevertheless detected a negative effect on survival on the RFH, even at the currently low level of human development. Our study highlights the importance of assessing effects of human disturbances at various spatiotemporal scales, and of considering the relative influence of other non-anthropogenic factors to fully understand drives of wildlife populations.","[Plante, Sabrina; Dussault, Christian; Richard, Julien H.; Cote, Steeve D.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Caribou Ungava, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Plante, Sabrina; Richard, Julien H.; Cote, Steeve D.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Dussault, Christian] Minist Forets Faune & Parcs, Direct Expertise Faune Terr Herpetofaune & Avifau, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Garel, Mathieu] ONCFS Unite Ongules Savages, Gieres, France",,"Plante, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Caribou Ungava, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.; Plante, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",Sabrina.plante.6@ulaval.ca,,,,,,103,2,3,4,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Such an approach, frequently used in rodents, has recently been employed in the Marmoset Predator Confrontation Test (MPCT). In this method, marmoset monkeys are individually confronted with a taxidermized predator (wild oncilla cat) in a previously habituated maze environment, while several easily discernable fear/anxiety-related behaviors are measured. Confrontation with the cat stimulus significantly altered ongoing behaviors, each habituating distinctively during repeated exposures; e.g. complete rapid habituation (alarm call), complete slow habituation (exploration, vigilance) or only partial habituation (proximity avoidance). Pharmacological validating studies with diazepam and buspirone induced a significant dose-dependent reversal of the fear-induced proximic avoidance and scratching/scent-marking behaviors, while exploration (smell/lick the maze, leg stand) was found to increase. The neuropeptide substance P and the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 resulted in a similar anxiolytic-like profile. The response pattern observed was not influenced by social isolation, handling/manual restraint, novel environment exposure or habituation to the stimulus or its location. Persistent defensive behavior and response pattern to diazepam was observed when naive versus MPCT-experienced marmosets were tested following a recent predatory stress. Taken together, the results indicate that the MPCT is a valuable experimental procedure to measure fear and anxiety-related behaviors in non-human primates.","[Barros, Marilia; Tomaz, Carlos] Univ Brasilia, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Maior, Rafael Souto; Tomaz, Carlos] Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Ctr Primate, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Lab Neurosci & Behav, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Huston, Joseph P.] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Physiol Psychol 1, D-4000 Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Barros, M (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mbarros@unb.br,"Barros, Marilia/G-1169-2012; Tomaz, Carlos A B/F-8626-2012; Huston, Joseph P/C-8986-2009; Maior, Rafael S./F-3994-2012","Barros, Marilia/0000-0002-5010-8509; Maior, Rafael S./0000-0001-7219-8675",,,,90,27,27,2,19,FREUND & PETTMAN PUBLISHERS,EAST YORKSHIRE,"ENHOLMES HALL, PATRINGTON, EAST YORKSHIRE HU12 OPR, ENGLAND",0334-1763,,,REV NEUROSCIENCE,Rev.

Behavioral responses of prey in relation to large carnivore predation risk have mainly been conducted in areas with low anthropogenic impact. We used long-term data on the distribution of moose in different habitat types in a system characterized by intensive management of all three trophic levels (silviculture, harvest of wolves and moose) to study effects on moose habitat selection resulting from the return of an apex predator, the wolf. We assumed that coursing predators such as wolves will cause an increased risk for moose in some habitat types and tested the hypotheses that moose will avoid open or young forest habitats following wolf establishment. After wolf recolonization, moose reduced their use of one type of open habitat (bog) but there was neither change in the use of the other open habitat type (clear-cut), nor in their use of young forest. Wolf establishment did not influence the use of habitat close to dense habitat when being in open habitats. Thus, the effect of wolves varied among habitat types and there was no unidirectional support for a behavioral effect of wolves' establishment on moose habitat use. Human-driven habitat heterogeneity, concentration of moose forage to certain habitat types, and the effects of a multiple predator guild on moose may all contribute to the results found. We conclude that the landscape of fear is likely to have weak ecological effects on moose in this system.","[Sand, Hakan; Jamieson, Mark; Andren, Henrik; Wikenros, Camilla; Mansson, Johan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, S-73993 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Cromsigt, Joris] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",,"Sand, H (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, S-73993 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",hakan.sand@slu.se,,"Sand, Hakan/0000-0002-2646-022X; Cromsigt, Joris/0000-0002-8632-9469; Mansson, Johan/0000-0002-5189-2091; Andren, Henrik/0000-0002-5616-2426",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [2016-01038]; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency [NV08503]; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Foundation,"Open access funding provided by Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

Generally, the degree of fearfulness correlates with intensity, duration, and frequency of freezing behaviours in response to fear-relevant stimuli. The present study examines innate fear responses to human handling in 144 newly hatched chicks through a tonic immobility (TI) test. Two fear responses-freezing duration and number of TI inductions-were examined. Individual variations in innate fear were investigated in chicks 1-2 days post-hatching when the restraint procedure was successively repeated 3 times within each day. Chicks showed sensitivity to fearful stimuli and considerable inter-individual variation in freezing duration and number of attempts required to induce TI. Moreover, differences were observed between breeds; White Leghorn chicks showed relatively low fear levels with gradual increases in TI duration, whereas Nagoya chicks showed extended TI duration and habituation to fearful stimuli. Our results suggest that TI reactions among newly hatched chicks are an innately determined behaviour specific to a breed or strain of chicken. Further, fearful responses among newborn chicks are not simple, but complex behaviours that involve multiple factors, such as breed-specific contextual fear learning and habituation/sensitisation processes.

Prey species are often faced with a tradeoff between food and safety in situations where food availability and predation risk peak in the same habitat type. Determining the optimal strategy becomes more complex if predators with different hunting mode create contrasting landscapes of risk, but this has rarely been documented in vertebrates. Roe deer in southeastern Norway face predation risk from lynx, as well as hunting by humans. These two predators differ greatly in their hunting methods. The predation risk from lynx, an efficient stalk-and-ambush predator is expected to be higher in areas with dense understory vegetation, while predation risk from human hunters is expected to be higher where visual sight lines are longer. Based on field observations and airborne LiDAR data from 71 lynx predation sites, 53 human hunting sites, 132 locations from 15 GPS-marked roe deer, and 36 roe deer pellet locations from a regional survey, we investigated how predation risk was related to terrain attributes and vegetation classes/structure. As predicted, we found that increasing cover resulted in a contrasting lower predation risk from humans and higher predation risk from lynx. Greater terrain ruggedness increased the predation risk from both predators. Hence, multiple predators may create areas of contrasting risk as well as double risk in the same landscape. Our study highlights the complexity of predator-prey relationship in a multiple predator setting. Synthesis In this study of risk effects in a multi-predator context, LiDAR data were used to quantify cover in the habitat and relate it to vulnerability to predation in a boreal forest. We found that lynx and human hunters superimpose generally contrasting landscapes of fear on a common prey species, but also identified double-risk zones. Since the benefit of anti-predator responses depends on the combined risk from all predators, it is necessary to consider complete predator assemblages to understand the potential for and occurrence of risk effects across study systems.","[Lone, Karen; Loe, Leif Egil; Gobakken, Terje; Remmen, Jorgen] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Linnell, John D.

However, few experimental studies in rats have implicated the IC in threat responses. We have recently reported that inactivation of the primary interoceptive cortex (pIC) during pre-training, or the intra-pIC blockade of protein synthesis immediately after training, impaired the consolidation of auditory fear conditioning. The present study was designed to investigate the role of the pIC in innate and learned defensive responses to predator odor. Freezing behavior was elicited by single or repetitive exposures to a collar that had been worn by a domestic cat. Sessions were video-recorded and later scored by video observation. We found that muscimol inactivation of the pIC reduced the expression of freezing reaction in response to a single or repeated exposure to cat odor. We also found that pIC inactivation with muscimol impaired conditioning of fear to the context in which rats were exposed to cat odor. Furthermore, neosaxitoxin inactivation of the pIC resulted in a prolonged and robust reduction in freezing response in subsequent re-exposures to cat odor. In addition, freezing behavior significantly correlated with the neural activity of the IC. The present results suggest that the IC is involved in the expression of both innate and learned fear responses to predator odor.","[Rodriguez, Maria; Torrealba, Fernando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Fisiol, Santiago, Chile; [Ceric, Francisco] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Psicol, Lab Neurociencia Afect, Santiago, Chile; [Murgas, Paola; Contreras, Marco] Univ Mayor, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Biol Integnat, Santiago, Chile; [Harland, Bruce; Contreras, Marco] Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Contreras, M (corresponding author), Univ Mayor, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Biol Integnat, Santiago, Chile.; Contreras, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",marco.contreras@umayor.cl,"Murgas, Paola/AAY-8814-2020","Ceric, Francisco/0000-0002-5526-3399; Rodriguez, Maria de los Angeles/0000-0002-6199-5705",Anillo Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Conicyt) [ACT-66]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (Fondecyt)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1130042],"This work was financially supported by Anillo Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Conicyt) ACT-66, and Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (Fondecyt) 1130042.",,68,4,4,2,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

It has been suggested that this recurring domesticated phenotype may be a result of correlated responses to a central trait, namely increased tameness. We selected Red Junglefowl, the ancestors of domesticated chickens, during five generations for reduced fear of humans. This caused a marked and significant response in tameness, and previous studies have found correlated effects on growth, metabolism, reproduction, and some behaviour not directly selected for. Here, we report the results from a series of behavioural tests carried out on the initial parental generation (P0) and the fifth selected generation (S5), focusing on behaviour not functionally related to tameness, in order to study any correlated effects. Birds were tested for fear of humans, social reinstatement tendency, open field behaviour at two different ages, foraging/exploration, response to a simulated aerial predator attack and tonic immobility. In S5, there were no effects of selection on foraging/ exploration or tonic immobility, while in the social reinstatement and open field tests there were significant interactions between selection and sex. In the aerial predator test, there were significant main effects of selection, indicating that fear of humans may represent a general wariness towards predators. In conclusion, we found only small correlated effects on behaviours not related to the tameness trait selected for, in spite of them showing high genetic correlations to fear of humans in a previous study on the same population. This suggests that species- specific behaviour is generally resilient to changes during domestication.","[Agnvall, Beatrix; Jensen, Per] Linkoping Univ, IFM Biol, Avian Behav Genom & Physiol Grp, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",,"Jensen, P (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, IFM Biol, Avian Behav Genom & Physiol Grp, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",perje@ifm.liu.se,,,European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [322206]; FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas [221-2007-838]; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [621-2008-5437],"This work is supported by European Research Council 322206 http://erc.europa.eu, FORMAS 221-2007-838 http://www.formas.se/en/ Vetenskapsradet 621-2008-5437 http://www.vr.se.

According to the risk allocation hypothesis, prey increase antipredatory behaviour and reduce foraging activity during pulses of high risk, but with continuous risk, other activities must continue and antipredatory behaviour decreases despite the risk. We studied the impact of lynx presence on the vigilance behaviour of wild roe deer under conditions of (i) a pulsed elevated risk by experimentally spreading lynx urine as an olfactory cue, and (ii) continuous risk by comparing an area where lynx was eradicated 160years ago to an area where lynx has been re-introduced 30years ago. Roe deer were extremely vigilant in response to the predator olfactory cue; however, roe deer vigilance did not differ measurably among areas with or without potential lynx presence. Deer were more vigilant before sunset than during the night at both study areas, probably due to long-term adaptation of roe deer to human hunting during daytime. Vigilance decreased from August to September even though activity of lynx increases in autumn, which may be a result either of increased foraging due to decrease in food quality in autumn, or of changes in social organization of the deer. Our results suggested that the degree of vigilance depends on environmental cues. We found that roe deer respond to lynx urine despite a long absence of lynx in the ecosystem. Our results support the risk allocation hypothesis for responses to pulses of high risk but not for responses to continuous elevated levels of risk.","[Eccard, Jana A.; Meissner, Jessica K.] Univ Potsdam, Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Meissner, Jessica K.; Heurich, Marco] Bavarian Forest Natl Pk, Dept Res, Grafenau, Germany; [Heurich, Marco] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, Freiburg, Germany",,"Eccard, JA (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",eccard@uni-potsdam.de,"Heurich, Marco/O-4653-2014","Heurich, Marco/0000-0003-0051-2930",EU programme INTERREG IV (EFRE Ziel 3); Bavarian Forest National Park Administration,"This study was part of a project on the predator-prey relationship of the Eurasian lynx, roe deer and red deer carried out by the Bavarian Forest National Park Administration, Department of Research and Documentation.

Fear is a basic emotion that activates behavioural responses upon encountering a predator, being consistently higher in females than in males. In this study, we investigated associations between fear of a large carnivore predator and perceived physical condition in a sample of Slovakian participants (n = 943). When testing evolutionary hypotheses explaining gender differences in fear of predators, we found partial support for the physical condition hypothesis, because females either reported lower perceived body condition than males and their perceived body condition showed significant correlation with fear of brown bear, Ursus arctos. The negative association between fear and perceived body condition was stronger in males suggesting that fear evolved as a response to higher predation pressures on males in our evolutionary past, indirectly supporting the predation pressure hypothesis. Males and participants with higher fear of bears wanted to exterminate bears by shooting more than others, suggesting that future management strategies should be oriented on elimination of fear of predators, as primary predictor of extremely negative attitudes toward bears.","[Prokop, Pavol; Fancovicova, Jana] Trnava Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Biol, SK-91843 Trnava, Slovakia; [Prokop, Pavol] Inst Zool, Dept Anim Ecol, SK-84506 Bratislava, Slovakia",,"Prokop, P (corresponding author), Trnava Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Biol, Priemyselna 4,POB 9, SK-91843 Trnava, Slovakia.",pavol.prokop@savba.sk,"Prokop, Pavol/ABD-9546-2020; Brainerd, Scott M./A-1172-2010","Prokop, Pavol/0000-0003-2016-7468; ",,,,66,43,44,0,19,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

Here, we describe a simple method with which we intend to induce fear/anxiety responses in this species. The method allows us to deliver a visual and lateral line stimulus (vibration or tapping) to the fish with the use of a moving object, a ball colliding with the side glass of the experimental tank. We describe the hardware construction of the apparatus and the procedure of the behavioral paradigm. We also present data on how zebrafish respond to the tapping.

The spatial variation in predation risk across a landscape, as perceived by prey across their foraging or home range, creates a landscape of fear by which individuals modify their behavior in response to the level of perceived risk. Here, we explored the influence of perceived predation risk, habitat features associated with risk, and fruit availability, on the spatial variation in behavior of the endangered forest-dwelling samango monkey (Cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi). We collected behavioral and location data on two habituated samango monkey groups in the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa, between 2012 and 2016. We further collected location data of the samango monkey's acoustically distinct alarm call, which has an unambiguous association with aerial predators, to spatially map perceived risk across the landscape. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that perceived risk from eagles significantly influenced the spatial distribution of critical life-functioning behaviors, with samango monkeys increasing feeding and foraging in high-risk areas. To mitigate this risk, samangos increased cohesion between group members, which subsequently reduced vigilance levels. Group cohesion further increased in high-risk areas with abundant fruit, relative to high-risk, fruit-poor areas, demonstrating the monkey's foraging/risk trade-off. Feeding was also reduced in areas of low canopy height, while vigilance decreased with increasing understory visibility and distance from sleep site, showing the influence of landscape features on risk perception from other predator guilds. Thus, for arboreal species foraging in a 3-D landscape, risk perception may occur at multiple scales and in response to multiple predator guilds. Only moving was influenced by fruit availability, either due to moving between localized food patches or from escaping high-risk areas following feeding bouts. These findings highlight that risk-taking in samango monkeys is only associated with behaviors fundamental to survival at a given location and that increased cohesion between neighbors is the main antipredator response in this species.","[Parker, Edwin J.; Koyama, Nicola F.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Parker, Edwin J.; Hill, Russell A.] Lajuma Res Ctr, Primate & Predator Project, Louis Trichardt, South Africa; [Hill, Russell A.] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham, England; [Hill, Russell A.] Univ Venda, Dept Zool, Thohoyandou, South Africa",,"Koyama, NF (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",n.f.koyama@ljmu.ac.uk,"Hill, Russell/D-9113-2013","Hill, Russell/0000-0002-7601-5802; Koyama, Nicola/0000-0002-3912-1550",Durham University; Liverpool John Moores University; Earthwatch Institute,"Durham University; Earthwatch Institute; Liverpool John Moores University, Grant/Award Number: NA",,140,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,e3945,10.1002/ecs2.3945,,,18,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZG4YA,WOS:000760264100008,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2022-04-19,

Theory suggests that fear responses may be either higher in areas with high disturbance (disturbance avoidance) or lower in such areas (e.g. due to habituation). We used flight initiation distance (FID) to study how fear responses of 16 bird species varied with distance from villages (range 0.1-11.6 km) within the Ramsar site of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. A linear model indicated that FID was not related to distance from villages, but varied between habitats. However, a piecewise linear model (linear response up to 2 km, flat response > 2 km from villages) provided a better fit and suggested that there may be a small decrease in FID close to human settlements, in particular for the Common Bulbul (Pycnonotus barbatus) and a few other species, although the majority of species still showed little change in FID with distance from human settlements. Our results suggest that a few species may respond to human disturbance with a decreased FID, whereas the majority of species showed little variation in FID in relation to distance from human settlements, and may therefore be negatively affected by increasing frequency of human disturbance.","[Bjorvik, Linn M.; Dale, Svein; Moe, Stein R.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Hermansen, Gudmund H.] Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Munishi, Pantaleo K.

In the current study, cat odor produced unlearned, innate fear in infant (postnatal age 14; PN14) and juvenile (PN26) rats, but contextual fear learning occurred only in juveniles. It was hypothesized that contextual fear learning in juveniles is mediated by norepinephrine. Consistent with this hypothesis, pre-training injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol reduced the unlearned fear response while post-training injection inhibited contextual fear learning in juvenile rats exposed to cat odor. We suggest that NE mediates the formation of contextual fear memories by activation of the transcription factor CREB in the hippocampus in juveniles but not in infants. Levels of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) were increased in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of juvenile rats exposed to cat odor. These levels were not increased in infants or juveniles exposed to a control odor. Further, propranolol blocked these increases in pCREB. In conclusion, although innate fear occurs within the neonatal period, contextual fear learning is a relatively late-occurring event, is hippocampal dependent, and mediated by norepinephrine.

In landscapes dominated by human activities, wildlife can respond to human disturbance in a similar fashion to the risk of predation. Further, the risk allocation hypothesis suggests that individuals respond most strongly to risk when it is spatially and temporally predictable. We predict that individuals in agriculturally dominated landscapes will respond to potential risk from humans during hunting season by shifting their behavior to avoid agricultural areas during the day, instead retreating to refuge habitat. We predict that this shift to more nocturnal behavior will be strongest for elk (Cervus elaphus) adult female-calf pairs and will be influenced by the level of moon illumination. Using motion-sensing cameras, we studied the response of elk moving between the Wainwright Dunes Ecological Reserve (a hunting refuge) and surrounding agriculturally dominated landscape in east-central Alberta, Canada, to human disturbance in relation to sunrise and sunset. Elk became increasingly nocturnal with the onset of hunting, leaving the refuge following sunset and returning to the refuge earlier before sunrise. Further, elk became increasingly nocturnal in response to greater levels of moon illumination. Lastly, we found that adult female-calf pairs perceived greater risks associated with diurnal activity and exhibited the most nocturnal behavior relative to other demographic classes. Our results suggest that ungulate management based on traditional hunting seasons and times may be problematic as it creates strong cues for resident elk, allowing them to minimize risk by avoiding risky places at risky times in accordance with the risk allocation hypothesis.

We quantified how vigilance and flight behavior in mule deer Odocoileus hemionus varied with distance from an area of concentrated human activity-a subalpine field station. An observer walked trails at various distances away from the station looking for deer. Upon encounter, the observer walked toward the focal animal and noted the distance at which it alerted and directed its attention to the approaching human (Alert Distance; AD), and the distance at which it fled (Flight Initiation Distance; FID). AD and FID both increased nonlinearly with distance from the center of the field station, reaching plateaus around 250 m and 750 m, respectively. Deer also tended to flee by stotting or running, rather than by walking, when far from the station but they walked away when near the station. These results indicate that deer perceive lower risk near a focused area of human activity, and that vigilance and flight behaviors respond on somewhat different spatial scales. The concept of a spatial human footprint on behavior may be useful for understanding how human activities affect wildlife.","[Price, Mary V.; Strombom, Evelyn H.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Price, Mary V.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,"Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244","Robert Enders Field Research Award from the Department of Biology, Swarthmore College; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1119660]","We thank Sara Hiebert Burch and Nick Waser for advice, Nick Waser for editing the manuscript, and four anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

We experimentally tested whether introducing trained Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) through falconry could be an effective management tool to reduce nuisance Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca). We hypothesized that falconry would result in elevated fear responses of geese, resulting in increased vigilance, reduced favorability of the site, and locally reduced abundance. We conducted our study on 3 golf courses (1 treatment and 2 controls) in the Western Cape, South Africa, where Egyptian geese are a pest species. Our treatment involved flying the Harris's hawk directly at geese from golf carts. We monitored vigilance and goose numbers before, during, and after treatment. Goose vigilance at the treatment site increased by 76% and abundance declined by 73% following falconry. We did not observe changes at either control site. Although the hawks killed some geese, the decreases in abundance were almost 3 times greater than the numbers killed, indicating that indirect effects were considerably larger than the direct effect of mortality. During the treatment period, vigilance rates were greater in the presence of a golf cart, suggesting that geese learned to associate carts with the threat of predation. Post-treatment vigilance rates were significantly less than rates detected during the treatment period and goose abundance on the experimental site increased rapidly post-treatment, returning to pre-treatment rates within 2 months. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of falconry to reduce nuisance bird abundance and suggest there may be other applications where the deployment of trained predators can be used to mitigate negative human-wildlife interactions.

A study of identical twins concluded that this extinction deficit does not predate trauma but develops as a result of trauma. The present study tested whether the Lewis rat model of PTSD reproduces these features of the human syndrome. Lewis rats were subjected to classical auditory fear conditioning before or after exposure to a predatory threat that mimics a type of traumatic stress that leads to PTSD in humans. Exploratory behavior on the elevated plus maze 1 wk after predatory threat exposure was used to distinguish resilient vs. PTSD-like rats. Properties of extinction varied depending on whether fear conditioning and extinction occurred before or after predatory threat. When fear conditioning was carried out after predatory threat, PTSD-like rats showed a marked extinction deficit compared with resilient rats. In contrast, no differences were seen between resilient and PTSD-like rats when fear conditioning and extinction occurred prior to predatory threat. These findings in Lewis rats closely match the results seen in humans with PTSD, thereby suggesting that studies comparing neuronal interactions in resilient vs. at-risk Lewis rats might shed light on the causes and pathophysiology of human PTSD.","[Goswami, Sonal; Cascardi, Michele; Rodriguez-Sierra, Olga E.; Duvarci, Sevil; Pare, Denis] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Cascardi, Michele] Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA",,"Pare, D (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",pare@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [RO1 MH083710]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH083710] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This material is based upon work supported by NIMH grant RO1 MH083710 to D.

Temporal avoidance of interspecific aggression can enable access to resources without spatial exclusion. Apex predators, including humans, can affect mesopredator activity patterns. Human context might also modify temporal interactions between predators. We explored activity patterns, nocturnality and the effects of human activity upon a guild of carnivores (grey wolf, Canis lupus; Eurasian lynx, Lynx lynx; red fox, Vulpes vulpes) using travel routes in Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia. Humans were diurnal, foxes nocturnal and large carnivores active during the night, immediately after sunrise and before sunset. Carnivore activity patterns overlapped greatly and to a similar extent for all pairings. Activity curves followed expectations based on interspecific killing, with activity peaks coinciding where body size differences were small (wolf and lynx) but not when they were intermediate (foxes to large carnivores). Carnivore activity, particularly fox, overlapped much less with that of diurnal humans. Foxes responded to higher large carnivore activity by being more nocturnal. Low light levels likely provide safer conditions by reducing the visual detectability of mesopredators. The nocturnal effect of large carnivores was however moderated and reduced by human activity. This could perhaps be due to temporal shielding or interference with risk cues. Subtle temporal avoidance and nocturnality may enable mesopredators to cope with interspecific aggression at shared spatial resources. Higher human activity moderated the effects of top-down temporal suppression which could consequently affect the trophic interactions of mesopredators.Significance statementTemporal partitioning can provide an important mechanism for spatial resource access and species coexistence. Our findings show that carnivores partition the use of shared travel routes in time, using the cover of darkness to travel safely where their suppressors (large carnivores) are more active. We however observed fox nocturnality to be flexible, with responses depending on the activity levels but also the composition of apex predators. High human activity modified the top-down temporal suppression of mesopredators by large carnivores. The use of time by predators can have demographic and trophic consequences. Prey accessibility and susceptibility can be temporally variable. As such, the ecosystem services and the ecological roles of predators may be affected by human time use as well as that of intraguild competitors. Temporal interactions should not be overlooked when evaluating human use and conservation priorities in protected areas.","[Haswell, Peter M.; Jones, Katherine A.; Hayward, Matt W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Kusak, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Vet Fac, Dept Biol, Heinzelova 55, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Hayward, Matt W.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Hayward, Matt W.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Hayward, Matt W.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, Pretoria, South Africa",,"Haswell, PM (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",p.m.haswell@bangor.ac.uk,"Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010; Haswell, Peter/AAL-9477-2021","Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653; Haswell, Peter/0000-0002-3440-739X; Kusak, Josip/0000-0002-5544-6486; Jones, Katherine/0000-0001-7547-6781",Bernd Thies Foundation; UK Wolf Conservation Trust; Coalbourn Charitable Trust; Nacionalni Park Plitvicka Jezera (Plitvice Lakes National Park); Ann Vernon Memorial Travel Fund; Sir Ian McKellen; EuroNatur; Bangor University,"This work received funding from Nacionalni Park Plitvicka Jezera (Plitvice Lakes National Park), The Bernd Thies Foundation, EuroNatur, Bangor University, The UK Wolf Conservation Trust, The Coalbourn Charitable Trust, Ann Vernon Memorial Travel Fund and Sir Ian McKellen.",,87,7,7,7,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

However, 8-OHDPATs potential role in unconditioned fear has yet to be elucidated. The current study was designed to investigate the effects of 8-OHDPAT on behavioral and HPA axis function in response to an innate fear-inducing stimulus. Pretreatment with 8-OHDPAT resulted in a significant decrease in freezing grooming, and climbing and caused a significant increase in approach after exposure to an extract from fox feces, 2,5-dihyrdo-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), an unconditioned fear-inducing stimulus. Furthermore, 8-OHDPAT pretreatment also resulted in a significant decrease in blood corticosterone levels, a marker of HPA activation.

In infant rats, fear to natural predator odors emerges around postnatal day (PN) 10 when infant rats begin walking. The behavioral emergence of fear is correlated with two physiological events: functional emergence of the amygdala and increasing corticosterone (CORT) levels. Here, we hypothesize that increasing corticosterone levels influence amygdala activity to permit the emergence of fear expression. We assessed the relationship between fear expression (immobility similar to freezing), amygdala function (c-fos) and the level of corticosterone in pups in response to presentation of novel male odor (predator), littermate odor and no odor. CORT levels were increased in PN8 pups (no fear, normally low CORT) by exogenous CORT Q mg/kg) and decreased in PN 12 pups (express fear, CORT levels higher) through adrenalectomy and CORT replacement. Results showed that PN8 expression of fear to a predator odor and basolateral/lateral amygdala activity could be prematurely evoked with exogenous CORT, while adrenalectomy in PN12 pups prevented both fear expression and amygdala activation. These results suggest that low neonatal CORT level serves to protect pups from responding to fear inducing stimuli and attenuate amygdala activation. This suggests that alteration of the neonatal CORT system by environmental insults such as alcohol, stress and illegal drugs, may also alter the neonatal fear system and its underlying neural control.

Fear can be innate or learned. Whereas the neural circuits underlying learned fear are already well investigated, the knowledge about the circuits mediating innate fear is still limited. We here used a novel, unbiased approach to image in vivo the spatial patterns of neural activity in odor-induced innate fear behavior in rats. We intravenously injected awake unrestrained rats with a 99m-technetium labeled blood flow tracer (99mTc-HMPAO) during ongoing exposure to fox urine or water as control, and mapped the brain distribution of the trapped tracer using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Upon fox urine exposure blood flow increased in a number of brain regions previously associated with odor-induced innate fear such as the amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamus and dorsolateral periaqueductal grey, but, unexpectedly, decreased at higher significance levels in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). Significant flow changes were found in regions monosynaptically connected to the IPN. Flow decreased in the dorsal tegmentum and entorhinal cortex. Flow increased in the habenula (Hb) and correlated with odor effects on behavioral defensive strategy. Hb lesions reduced avoidance of but increased approach to the fox urine while IPN lesions only reduced avoidance behavior without approach behavior. Our study identifies a new component, the IPN, of the neural circuit mediating odor-induced innate fear behavior in mammals and suggests that the evolutionarily conserved Hb-IPN system, which has recently been implicated in cued fear, also forms an integral part of the innate fear circuitry.","[Vincenz, Daniel; Goldschmidt, Juergen] Leilniz Inst Neurobiol, Dept Syst Physiol Learning, D-39118 Magdeburg, Germany; [Wernecke, Kerstin E.

When exposure reveals that a stimulus is associated with a cost, fearful behavior should increase. Conversely, neophobic fear should decrease when negative outcomes do not regularly follow the stimulus. Because exposure to anthropogenic stimuli is more common in birds that inhabit urbanized landscapes, their fear response patterns should more accurately reflect the risks associated with these stimuli. We conducted a series of feeder and playback experiments to explore whether urbanization altered black-capped chickadees' (Poecile atricapillus) fear responses to model cats, humans, a novel object, and anthropogenic noise. We predicted that fearful responses to cat models would increase in birds as urbanization increased because negative interactions with cats are more common in the city. However, we expected urban birds to be less fearful of our other stimuli because fitness costs are absent or less severe. As predicted, the fear of cats increased with urbanization, but the fear of noise decreased - as indicated by willingness to visit a feeding station. Other stimuli were not associated with urbanization, which may be related to the use of county and city parks where human presence is relatively common. Nonetheless, our results suggest that plastic fear responses to novel stimuli may facilitate urban success in the black-capped chickadee. More generally, behavioral plasticity may indicate the ability of a species to thrive in the urban environment.","[Van Donselaar, Jenna L.; Atma, Jenna L.; Kruyf, Zachary A.; LaCroix, Hattie N.; Proppe, Darren S.] Calvin Coll, Dept Biol, 3201 Burton St SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA",,"Proppe, DS (corresponding author), Calvin Coll, Dept Biol, 3201 Burton St SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA.",dsp5@calvin.edu,,"Proppe, Darren/0000-0001-7741-6504",Calvin College Biology Department and Science Division,"All protocols were approved by the Calvin College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

For a prey animal in the wild, such as a sheep, behavioural responses have evolved to evade detection and capture by predators. The behavioural responses of the wild ancestors of domestic sheep to the threat of predation are characterised predominantly by vigilance, flocking, flight to cover and behavioural inhibition once refuge has been reached Some limited defensive behaviours are seen, mainly in females with young against small predators. Vigilance and flight distance are affected by the animal's assessment of risk and are influenced by the environment social group size, age, sex and reproductive condition, as well as by previous experience with potential predators. Under conditions of stress, domestic sheep show similar behavioural reactions to wild sheep, although the threshold at which they are elicited may be elevated. This is particularly evident when comparing less selected hill breeds with more highly selected lowland breeds, and suggests that a continuum of responsiveness exists between wild and feral sheep, through hill breeds to the lowland sheep breeds. However, this may be confounded by the previous experience of the breeds, particularly their familiarity with humans. Behavioural and neurobiological evidence suggests that although the behavioural response to predators (vigilance, flight) is innate, the stimuli that elicit this behavioural pattern may have a learned component. Since vigilance and flight distances are affected by the animal's perception of threat, they may be useful indices of stress in sheep and, as graded responses, give some indication of the level of threat experienced by the sheep. Thus they may indicate the amount of fear or distress experienced by the sheep and hence have the potential to be used in the assessment of welfare states.","Scottish Agr Coll, Sustainable Livestock Syst, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland",,"Dwyer, CM (corresponding author), Scottish Agr Coll, Sustainable Livestock Syst, W Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",c.dwyer@ed.sac.ac.uk,"Dwyer, Cathy/F-7692-2011","Dwyer, Cathy/0000-0001-7511-2056",,,,139,65,66,6,87,UNIV FEDERATION ANIMAL WELFARE,WHEATHAMPSTEAD,"OLD SCHOOL, BREWHOUSE HILL, WHEATHAMPSTEAD AL4 8AN, HERTS, ENGLAND",0962-7286,,,ANIM WELFARE,Anim.

In adopting these behaviors, prey incur substantial non-consumptive costs that can have population-level consequences. Because prey knowledge of risk is imperfect, individuals may even adopt these costly behaviors in the absence of a real threat. For example, rather than only avoid hunters, many species categorically avoid all anthropogenic activity. Although hunting seasons only increase risk for specific individuals (e.g., males), non-target individuals may still perceive human hunters as a source of risk and respond accordingly. Here, we used a large-scale experiment including 89 animal-years of location data from 62 unique individuals over 6 yr to quantify the duration, magnitude, and energetic consequences of changes to movement and resource selection behavior adopted by non-target female elk (Cervus canadensis) in response to human hunters during three separate experimental 5-d hunts (elk archery, deer rifle (Odocoileus hemionus or Odocoileus virginianus), and elk rifle). We predicted that elk response to hunters would be brief, but that strong behavioral responses to hunters (e.g., strengthened avoidance of roads and trails) would carry nutritional costs. We measured the duration of hunt-related changes in elk speed using quantile regression, further quantified the strength of elk behavioral responses to hunters using population-level resource selection functions, and evaluated whether anti-predator resource selection behavior translated to measurable metabolic costs in the form of reduced body fat heading into winter. Elk responses to human hunters were stronger in the day than at night and were generally more pronounced during the elk hunts than during deer hunts. During hunts, elk shifted their diurnal behavior to avoid forage and intensified their avoidance of roads and trails. The combination of these changes in behavior led to a predicted pattern of distribution during the hunt that differed substantially from the distribution prior to the hunt. Lactating females that more strongly avoided roads entered winter in poorer nutritional condition, suggesting that the changes in resource selection we describe carry corresponding nutritional costs that have the potential to impact subsequent population performance.","[Spitz, Derek B.; Levi, Taal] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Rowland, Mary M.; Wisdom, Michael J.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Clark, Darren A.; Smith, Joshua B.; Brown, Casey L.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA",,"Spitz, DB (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",spitzderek@gmail.com,,"Spitz, Derek/0000-0002-1282-3886; Brown, Casey/0000-0002-3901-7286",Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife; Wildlife Restoration Act; Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,"We would like to thank Brian Dick, Cheryl Borum, Jennifer Hafer, and Bridgett Naylor for data collection and management.

However, our knowledge of where oxytocin acts in the brain to achieve this effect, particularly to an unconditioned fear stimulus, is incomplete. We used blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI to test whether central administration of oxytocin 45-60 min before fMRI scanning alters maternal brain activation in response to a predator scent (TMT, trimethylthiazoline). Comparison behavioral experiments that examined maternal responses to this unconditioned fear-inducing odor were carried out in a separate cohort of lactating rats given similar treatments. Behavioral experiments confirmed the effectiveness of oxytocin at reducing freezing behavior as compared to vehicle controls. Our fMRI findings indicate that oxytocin modulated both positive and negative BOLD responses across several olfactory and forebrain nuclei. Significantly greater percent increases in BOLD signal in response to TMT were observed in the anterior cingulate, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and perirhinal area of oxytocin pretreated rats. These animals also showed significantly larger percent decreases in BOLD in mammillary bodies, secondary motor cortex, gustatory cortex, prelimbic prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, and the anterior olfactory nucleus. The observed pattern of brain activity suggests that oxytocin enhances neural processing in emotion and cognition driven brain areas such as the cingulate cortex, while dramatically reducing activity in areas also controlling autonomic, visceromotor and skeletomotor responses. The present data contribute to the growing literature suggesting the oxytocin modulate the integration of emotional and cognitive information through myriad brain regions to facilitate decreases in anxiety (even to an unconditioned stimulus) while potentially promoting pair-bonding, social memory and parental care.

Odors from predators are ecologically relevant stimuli used by prey animals as warnings for the presence of danger. Of importance, these odors are not necessarily noxious or painful, but they have innate threat-like properties. This review summarizes the progress made on the behavioral and neuroanatomical fundamentals of innate fear of the predator odor, 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a component of fox feces. TMT is one of several single molecule components of predator odors that have been isolated in the last several years. Isolation of these single molecules has allowed for rapid advances in delineating the behavioral constraints and selective neuroanatomical pathways of predator odor induced fear. In naive mice and rats, TMT induces a number of fear and defensive behaviors, including robust freezing, indicating it is an innate threat stimulus. However, there are a number of behavioral constraints that we do not yet understand. Similarly, while some of the early olfactory sensory pathways for TMT-induced fear are being delineated, the pathways from olfactory systems to emotional and motor output regions are less well understood. This review will focus on what we know and what we still need to learn about the behavior and neuroanatomy of TMT-induced fear.","[Rosen, Jeffrey B.; Asok, Arun; Chakraborty, Trisha] Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA",,"Rosen, JB (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 105 Green Room 108, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",jrosen@psych.udel.edu,,"Asok, Arun/0000-0001-9056-8799; Chakraborty, Trisha/0000-0003-4050-0600","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P20GM103653, R01HD075066]",The work was partially funded by grants P20GM103653 and R01HD075066 from the National Institutes of Health.,,108,61,61,2,27,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-453X,,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

In order to test the sensitivity of the behavioral parameters to an anxiolytic substance, the effects of the benzodiazepine diazepam on the anxiety measures were examined. The strategy was to use a naturally occurring stimulus known to elicit anxiety and fear in this species. A taxidermized predator (the wild cat Felis tigrina) was chosen as the stimulus to induce anxiety-related behaviors on the basis of a preceding study in which various stimuli were systematically compared in their effectiviness to induce fear responses. The apparatus consisted of three parallel arms of equal dimensions, joining two perpendicular arms at each end, thus comprising a figure eight-like or five-arm continuous rectangular maze. The wild-cat was placed outside of one corner of the maze's outer parallel arms. Each subject was submitted to six treatments given in random order: three drug sessions (diazepam 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg, IM), saline, sham (injection control), and a control session, involving neither manipulation nor injection. Subjects were placed into the back of the chamber, out of sight of the 'predator', 20 min after a treatment and given free access to the maze for 30 min. The behavioral repertoire was recorded via videocamera. The following behaviors were considered to be possible indices of emotionality relevant to exposure to the predator in the paradigm used: scratching, scent marking, exploration, frequency and time spent in each of 13 defined sections of the maze. Administration of diazepam induced a significant reduction in scratching and an increase in the time spent in the vicinity of the 'predator', as well as in the frequency of exploratory behaviors, indicative of an anxiolytic effect. Gender did not influence the effect of treatment. These results suggest that this new ethologically-based test may be a useful method for studying anxiety and fear-induced avoidance in non-human primates and for pre-clinical research on psychoactive drugs.

Previous work demonstrates that fear does adaptively influence visual perception. However, there are recurring situations in which auditory perception is used for overcoming immediate threats (e.g., avoiding predators after dark). Some research suggests that the auditory system, independent of fear, is adaptively biased to hear approaching sounds as closer than equidistant receding sounds (a.k.a. the looming bias). The present study investigated whether fear, as a superordinate mechanism, influences auditory perception such that sounds are perceived to be closer, ultimately providing an advantage when avoiding immediate threats. Participants judged whether or not they could reach to an aurally or visually perceived target while either in a fearful or neutral state. The results demonstrated that while in a fearful state, participants judged targets to be closer to them, but only when the target was perceived aurally. This finding extends previous work on adaptive biases in auditory perception to include the influence of fear. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The zebrafish is considered to be a promising vertebrate species with which the effects of alcohol on brain function and behavior and the mechanisms underlying these effects may be studied. Alcohol is known to induce alterations in motor function as well as fear and anxiety. Here we utilize a recently developed fear paradigm in which we employ an animated (moving) image of a bird silhouette. We measure the effect of acute alcohol administration (dose range employed: 0.00-0.75 vol/vol percentage, bath exposure for 60 min) on the behavioral responses of zebrafish. We test these responses during a pre-stimulus, stimulus and post-stimulus period of the task using both a video-tracking and an observation based quantification method. The fear inducing stimulus was found to decrease the distance of the zebrafish from the bottom of the tank, to increase number of erratic movements, and to increase the number of jumps in alcohol exposed fish (versus control fish). Alcohol attenuated these fear responses in a dose dependent manner. In addition, alcohol decreased general activity at the highest dose, an effect that was independent of the presentation of the stimulus.

The freezing response is represented by a motionless moment without any specific posture or behavioral sequence, and it is widely used in the fear conditioning paradigms and other relevant defensive situations. However, freezing measurements include fragmental components of several defensive behaviors that are exhibited during the session, such as behavioral inhibition, crouching, and a moment of risk assessment behavior. From an ethological view, behavioral analyses of C57BL/6 mice of both sexes and three different ages (postnatal days (P) 25, 35, and 65) revealed a rich variety of defensive behaviors during a fear conditioning session and in response to predatory odor exposure as a nonconditioned behavior. P-25 and 35 mice exhibited more behavioral inhibition than P-65 adult mice, and P-65 mice exhibited a crouching posture more often than younger mice. This age difference was more pronounced in males. The stretch-attend posture (SAP) increased with age, except in P-25 males, which exhibited robust SAP in response to a conditioned cue; this response indicates that P-25 males are defensive in a situation-nonmatching manner. Situation-dependent defense strategies were revealed in P-35 and 65 mice: Fear conditioning paradigm induced more robust defensive responses than predatory odor exposure, to which mice primarily exhibited SAP. A sex-based difference was revealed in adult mice. Males tended to show more passive defensive responses, such as crouching and withdrawal, and females exhibited more active responses, such as SAP. These age- and sex-based differences may stem from the ethological demands and illustrate adolescent ontogenetic processes of defense behavior.","[Arakawa, Hiroyuki] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 20 Penn St,HSFII S251, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Arakawa, Hiroyuki] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Med, Dept Res Adm, Rodent Behav Core, Cleveland, OH USA",,"Arakawa, H (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 20 Penn St,HSFII S251, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",harakawa@som.umaryland.edu,"Arakawa, Hiroyuki/W-3026-2019","Arakawa, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-6175-9278",Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine; Rodent Behavioral Core Institutional Fund; Public Health Service grants from the National Institute of Health [R01NS092216]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R01NS092216] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This study was supported by Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Rodent Behavioral Core Institutional Fund and Public Health Service grants from the National Institute of Health (R01NS092216: PI, RS Erzurumlu).

To investigate the prevalence of problem behaviors in this breed, 94 Argentine Dogo owners provided information on aggressive and fearful behaviors shown by their dogs (83 males, 98 females) in a questionnaire. The results were consistent with the origin of the Argentine Dogo (i.e., descending from fighting dogs) and subsequent selection exerted to improve hunting qualities. Common aggressive behaviors included predation on small animals (92.0%), intra-specific conflicts (69.5%), and territoriality (i.e., vigilance of territory perimeter, 61.3%; aggression toward people visiting the dog's house, 45.3%; vigilance while inside the owners' car, 33.1%). Aggression directed to the owner was marginally represented. Reactions to leashing, bathing, punishment, sleep disturbance, to), removal, and in other conflict situations occurred in less than 10% of the sample. Reactions to food removal (13.3%) and handling (19.8%) showed higher prevalence. Chasing cars/running people (17.6%) and aggression toward strangers, either those who were friendly (19.1%) or those who seemed threatening on approach (29.4%), were noted. Low anxiety levels reported in social situations confirmed that these reactions were not common (e.g.. fear of strangers, children, and unfamiliar dogs <= 10%). Common anxious behaviors were fear of traffic (10.3%), loud noises (36.2%), startling stimuli (30.5%), destructiveness (42.9%), excessive body licking (13.6%), and shyness in novel situations (32.4%). The context and targets of aggression when exhibited by these dogs (e.g., aggression toward animals when outside the dogs' territory, aggression towards people when inside territory) suggest that the Italian law on potentially dangerous dog breeds may be ineffective in preventing Argentine Dogos' aggression to humans. Social hazards could be reduced by promoting proper social exposure and reactions toward people. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Such nonconsumptive effects of perceived predation risk are mainly studied in ground-breeding birds. However, if antipredator responses characterize bird species generally, so should nonconsumptive effects of perceived predation associated with human recreation. Moreover, as individuals consistently differ in behaviors linked to antipredator responses, they should also differ in responses to recreation, with bolder birds being less affected. To test this key prediction, we quantified effects of human recreation pressure on a cavity-breeding passerine. We uniquely quantified human recreation pressure over a substantial (8-year) period within 12 nest box populations of the great tit Parus major, assayed annually for reproductive parameters. We detected considerable spatial variation in recreation pressure. In plots with high recreation pressure, we found strong support for birds breeding further away from highly frequented paths and birds producing smaller clutches; we also found moderate support for birds producing fewer fledglings. These detrimental effects did not vary with behavioral proxies of an individual's risk-taking phenotype (exploratory activity). This implies that effects of recreation pressure apply to the average bird, and extend to species (like forest birds) not previously considered.","[Hutfluss, A.; Dingemanse, N.

The risk allocation hypothesis states that prey should balance predator avoidance and feeding time according to the degree of predation risk. Are there patterns in behavioural, morphological, and fitness traits that provide insight into predictions of this hypothesis? Organism: We used offspring from two parentage lines of the freshwater gastropod, Physa pomilia, obtained from the exact same stream location but either (1) maintained in the laboratory for 3-4 generations or (2) newly field captured. Methods: We employed a caged-snail design in which offspring obtained from the laboratory culture and the newly field-captured snails were both exposed to a crayfish predator cue plus alarm cue for 40 days. We assessed behavioural, morphological, and fitness-related traits and conducted a short-term predator avoidance assay at the end of the 40-day experiment. Results: Over 40 days, offspring of newly caught and laboratory snails displayed similar proportions of predator avoidance behaviour on average. However, offspring of newly caught snails decreased their predator avoidance behaviour over time, as predicted by the risk allocation hypothesis, while offspring of laboratory snails did not. These differences were confirmed with a short-term behavioural assay. Offspring of newly caught snails also developed thicker shells with longer and narrower apertures than the offspring of laboratory snails, making them more predator resistant, which may have explained differences in behavioural responses. Predator cues strongly reduced total egg mass production. Egg mass production was greater in the offspring of laboratory snails under predator-free conditions but greater in the offspring of newly caught snails when exposed to predator cues. The results highlight the importance of population history in studies of phenotypic plasticity.","[Salice, Christopher J.; Plautz, Stephanie C.] Texas Tech Univ, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, Dept Environm Toxicol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",,"Salice, CJ (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, Dept Environm Toxicol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",chris.salice@ttu.edu,,,Texas Tech University; AT&T Chancellor's Fellowship,We thank Robert Dillon at the College of Charleston for kindly confirming the taxonomy of the study species.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the initial neuron responses is poorly understood. In this study, we monitored the innate defensive responses to aversive stimuli of either elevated plus maze or predator odor in juvenile mice and found that glutamatergic neurons were activated in amygdala. Loss of EphB2, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in amygdala neurons, suppressed the reactions and led to defects in spine morphogenesis and fear behaviors. We further found a coupling of spinogenesis with these threat cues induced neuron activation in developing amygdala that was controlled by EphB2. A constitutively active form of EphB2 was sufficient to rescue the behavioral and morphological defects caused by ablation of ephrin-B3, a brain-enriched ligand to EphB2. These data suggest that kinase-dependent EphB2 intracellular signaling plays a major role for innate fear responses during the critical developing period, in which spinogenesis in amygdala glutamatergic neurons was involved.","[Zhu, Xiao-Na; Yang, Jing-Yu] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiao-Na; Liu, Xian-Dong; Xu, Nan-Jie] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat Histol & Embryol, Div Neurosci,Chinese Minist Educ, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xian-Dong; Xu, Nan-Jie] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Key Lab Tumor Microenvironm & Inflammat, Dept Biochem & Mol Cell Biol,Chinese Minist Educ, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Hanyi; Xu, Nan-Jie] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Chinese Minist Educ, Key Lab Cell Differentiat & Apoptosis, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xian-Dong; Xu, Nan-Jie] Shanghai Key Lab Reprod Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Hanyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Inst Hlth Sci,Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Henkemeyer, Mark] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Kent Waldrep Ctr Basic Res Nerve Growth & Regener, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Henkemeyer, Mark] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Dev Biol, Kent Waldrep Ctr Basic Res Nerve Growth & Regener, Dallas, TX 75390 USA",,"Xu, NJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, 280 South Chong Qing Rd, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.; Yang, JY (corresponding author), Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, 103 Wen Hua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",jingyuyang2006@gmail.com; xunanjie@sjtu.edu.cn,"Xu, Nan-Jie/N-3391-2016; XU, Nan-Jie/AAJ-4363-2020","Xu, Nan-Jie/0000-0003-2147-3352; XU, Nan-Jie/0000-0003-2147-3352; , Jingyu Yang/0000-0002-2791-5281","National Basic Research Program of China (Program 973)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB965002]; National Natural and Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91232704, 31271160, 81373383]; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning [2013-25]; Shanghai Committee of Science and TechnologyShanghai Science & Technology Committee [11DZ2260200]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH066332]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH066332] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (Program 973 Grant 2014CB965002 (N.-J.X.), National Natural and Science Foundation of China Grants 91232704 and 31271160 (N.-J.X.) and 81373383 (J.Y.Y), the Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning (Grant 2013-25 to N.-J.X.), Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology Grant 11DZ2260200 (N.-J.X.), and NIH Grant MH066332 (M.H.).

Increased vigilance may therefore indicate increased fear. We tested dairy cattle to determine whether time spent vigilant changed in response to the novelty of their location, the presence of a dog or the presence of an aversive, gentle or unfamiliar handler. We conducted 123 min trials per cow on 40 cows tested individually in a large outdoor enclosure containing an attractive food source. The feeders restricted the animal's view so that it could not feed and scan simultaneously, so vigilance time was defined as any time the animal's head was raised. During the initial trials, the degree of vigilance was high, but the amount of vigilance decreased significantly with number of trials. Time vigilant was significantly higher in the presence of a dog than in the presence of a human or when neither was present. In a second experiment, 20 cows, that had been trained to recognise an aversive and a gentle person for 3 weeks prior to testing, were tested in an indoor pen containing an attractive food source with the aversive, gentle, or an unfamiliar person nearby. The presence of the aversive person significantly increased vigilance time compared to the unfamiliar and gentle people. However, vigilance time did not decrease with repeated exposure to the enclosure, perhaps because the testing barn was already familiar. These results suggest that cows alter their vigilance according to their degree of fearfulness toward people and toward different environments, and that measures of vigilance may provide information on the degree of fearfulness of the animals.

However, accurately assessing perceptions can be difficult since risk is often subjective and perceptions are affected by both emotions and experience. Lions attacked over 1,000 people in Tanzania between 1990 and 2007. We conducted questionnaire surveys to examine multiple aspects of risk perceptions in the areas with the highest incidence of lion attacks, focusing on three general questions: (1) how villagers perceive their overall risk of attack; (2) what factors influence risk perceptions; and, (3) what aspects of risk are perceived accurately. Overall, people overestimated their risk from lions: 53% of respondents felt they are very likely to be attacked while the actual risk is estimated at less than 1% over an average lifespan. Risk perceptions were correlated with gender, age, education, acres of cultivated land and number of livestock owned but not with previous experience with lion attacks in either the village or family or with sighting of lions or lion signs. Nevertheless, people were very aware of who was at relatively high risk and when and where risks were greatest. People also accurately assessed the risk from lions compared with mega-herbivores but not compared with other predatory species or with disease and famine, emphasizing the tendency for people to overestimate risks that are rare but elicit strong fears. This study highlights the value of using interdisciplinary techniques to examine human dimensions of human-lion conflict as risk perceptions and local knowledge can identify gaps in understanding that could improve conflict-prevention programs.","[Kushnir, Hadas] US Agcy Int Dev, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Kushnir, Hadas; Packer, Craig] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",,"Kushnir, H (corresponding author), US Agcy Int Dev, Washington, DC 20523 USA.; Kushnir, H (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",hadaskushnir1@gmail.com,,,American Philosophical Society; Columbus Zoo and Aquarium; Idea Wild; Wildlife Conservation Society; University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; National GeographicNational Geographic Society; Panthera,"Funding provided by American Philosophical Society, Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, Idea Wild, National Geographic, Panthera, Wildlife Conservation Society, and University of Minnesota.",,32,5,5,3,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

As urban and adjacent environments are becoming increasingly valuable habitat for wildlife, it is important to understand how susceptible taxa, like small prey animals, persist in urban environments under such additional stressors. Here, in order to determine how small prey animals' foraging patterns change in response to habitat components and distances to predators and human disturbances, we used filmed giving-up density (GUD) trials under natural conditions along an urban disturbance gradient. We then ran further GUD trials with the addition of experimentally introduced stressors of: the odors of domestic cat (Felis catus)/red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as predator cues, light and sound as human disturbance cues, and their combinations. Small mammals were mostly observed foraging in the GUD trials, and to a lesser degree birds. Animals responded to proximity to predators and human disturbances when foraging under natural conditions, and used habitat components differently based on these distances. Along the urban disturbance gradient situation-specific responses were evident and differed under natural conditions compared to additional stressor conditions. The combined predator with human disturbance treatments resulted in responses of higher perceived risk at environments further from houses. Animals at the urban-edge environment foraged more across the whole site under the additional stressor conditions, but under natural conditions perceived less risk when foraging near predators and further from human disturbance (houses). Contrastingly, at the environments further from houses, foraging near human disturbance (paths/roads) when close to a predator was perceived as lower risk, but when foraging under introduced stressor conditions these disturbances were perceived as high risk.

Fear of middle-predator affects the growth rate of prey and the fear of top-predator reduces the predation of middle-predator on prey species. The prey and middle-predator are assumed to take refuge against predation. Numerical results confirm the stabilizing role of refuge whereas hunting cooperation destroys stability and induces limit cycle oscillations. We find that the fear of middle-predator on prey has tendency to stabilize the system while the fear of top-predator on middle-predator creates instability in the system. Further, time delays are considered in the processes of taking refuges and hunting cooperations. Delay in hunting cooperations creates multiple stability switches in the system. Furthermore, seasonal forcing of parameters related to refuges and hunting cooperations depicts a more realistic scenario. We investigate the behaviors of seasonally forced system in the absence as well as presence of time delays. The seasonally forced system exhibits different types of periodic solutions. Complex bursting patterns are observed due to periodicity in refuge of middle-predator (cooperation of top-predator).

Particularly in areas where threatened populations of wildlife overlap with highly frequented tourist locations, managers are challenged with reducing impacts of human disturbance on wildlife. For grouse, Tetraonidae, most studies on the effects of human disturbance address individual responses, whereas for conservation, the most relevant question is whether human presence negatively impacts the abundance and viability of populations. I here summarise published studies on the responses of grouse to the presence of humans, review the conceptual foundations of predation-risk theory and the risk-disturbance hypothesis, and propose a framework for research to aid conservation of grouse. Because grouse are found in many environments they are excellent model species for testing the predictions of the risk-disturbance hypothesis.","Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",,"Storch, I (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",ilse.storch@wildlife.uni-freiburg.de,"Storch, Ilse/P-6806-2019; Storch, Ilse/N-7478-2019","Storch, Ilse/0000-0002-3252-2036; ",,,,86,27,29,6,74,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,DEC,2013,19,4,,,,,390,403,,10.2981/13-006,,,14,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,297KL,WOS:000330254200009,,Green Submitted,,,2022-04-19,

The ability to extinguish fear memory associations is impaired in PTSD individuals. As such, the development of extinction-enhancing pharmacological agents to be used in combination with exposure therapies may benefit the treatment of PTSD. Both mGlu5 and CB1 receptors have been implicated in contextual fear extinction. Thus, here we tested the ability of the mGlu5 positive allosteric modulator 3-Cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB) and cannabidiol (CBD) to reduce both conditioned and unconditioned fear. We used a predator-threat animal model of PTSD which we and others have previously shown to capture the heterogeneity of anxiety responses observed in humans exposed to trauma. Here, 1 week following a 10-min exposure to predator scent stress, rats were classified into stress-Susceptible and stress-Resilient phenotypes using behavioral criteria for elevated plus maze and acoustic startle response performance. Two weeks after classification, rats underwent 3 days of contextual fear extinction and were treated with vehicle, CDPPB or CBD prior to each session. Finally, the light-dark box test was employed to assess phenotypic differences and the effects of CDPPB and CBD on unconditioned anxiety. CDPBB but not CBD, reduced freezing in Susceptible rats relative to vehicle. In the light-dark box test for unconditioned anxiety, CBD, but not CDPPB, reduced anxiety in Susceptible rats. Resilient rats displayed reduced anxiety in the light-dark box relative to Susceptible rats. Taken together, the present data indicate that enhancement of mGlu5 receptor signaling in populations vulnerable to stress may serve to offset a resistance to fear memory extinction without producing anxiogenic effects. Furthermore, in a susceptible population, CBD attenuates unconditioned but not conditioned fear. Taken together, these findings support the use of predator-threat stress exposure in combination with stress-susceptibility phenotype classification as a model for examining the unique drug response profiles and altered neuronal function that emerge as a consequence of the heterogeneity of psychophysiological response to stress.","[Shallcross, John; Hamor, Peter; Bechard, Allison R.; Romano, Madison; Knackstedt, Lori; Schwendt, Marek] Univ Florida, Dept Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Shallcross, John; Hamor, Peter; Knackstedt, Lori; Schwendt, Marek] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Ctr Addict Res & Educ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Knackstedt, L; Schwendt, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Knackstedt, L; Schwendt, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Med, Ctr Addict Res & Educ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",knack@ufl.edu; schwendt@ufl.edu,"Knackstedt, Lori A/K-1956-2014",,"Institute on Molecular Neuroscience [8738sc, 9250sc];  [W81XWH-12-2-0048]","This work was supported by Institute on Molecular Neuroscience Subcontract 8738sc and 9250sc awarded to LK and MS.

The role of the central nucleus of the IC (CIC) in fear and anxiety has been suggested based on electrophysiological, behavioral and immunohistochemical studies. The reactivity of high-anxiety rats (HA) to diverse challenges is different from low-anxiety ones (LA). In humans and laboratory animals, pathological anxiety is often accompanied by heightened vigilance and alertness, hyperactivity of the amygdala (AM), and increased amplitude of the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) from the IC. This study aims to evaluate the influence of the inactivation of the central (CEA) and basolateral (BLA) nuclei of the amygdala, after local infusions of the full GABA(A) agonist muscimol (1 nmol/0.2 mu l), on the AEP elicited in the CIC of rats tested under a learned fear state. Our results showed that both BLA and CEA inactivation change the expression of conditioned fear, in a paradigm using the context as the conditioned stimulus (CS). These changes are correlated to the innate anxiety levels of the animals. It is supposed that this shortcoming is in addition to the imbalance between the regulatory role of the top-down and bottom-up processes in the control of anxiety. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We subsequently used updated data collected largely in urban and suburban environments in the United States and Canada during the past 30 years to develop strategies to reduce the risk of attacks. In the 1990s, increased incidents of coyote attacks were reported in states beyond California and in Canadian provinces. We documented 367 attacks on humans by coyotes from 1977 through 2015, of which 165 occurred in California. Of 348 total victims of coyote attack, 209 (60%) were adults, and 139 (40%) were children (age <= 10 years). Children (especially toddlers) are at greater risk of serious injury. The attacks exhibited seasonal patterns, with more occurring during the coyote breeding and pup-rearing season (March through August) than September through February. We reiterate management recommendations that, when enacted, have been demonstrated to effectively reduce risk of coyote attack in urban and suburban environments, and we note limitations of non-injurious hazing programs. We observed an apparent growing incidence of coyote attack on pets, an issue that we believe will drive coyote management policy at the local and state levels.","[Baker, Rex O.] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, 24652 Gleneagles Dr, Corona, CA 92883 USA; [Timm, Robert M.] Univ Calif, Hopland Res & Extens Ctr, 4070 Univ Rd, Hopland, CA 95449 USA",,"Baker, RO (corresponding author), Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, 24652 Gleneagles Dr, Corona, CA 92883 USA.",RBakerVertIPM@aol.com; rmtimm@ucanr.edu,,,,,,45,12,12,8,30,JACK H BERRYMAN INST,LOGAN,"UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT WILDLAND RESOURCES, LOGAN, UTAH 84322-5230 USA",1934-4392,1936-8046,,HUM-WILDL INTERACT,Hum.-Wildl.

Using Global Positioning System data collected from telemetry-collared elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus), we evaluated elk behavioral responses to spatial and temporal variation in wolf- and human-predation risk on a winter range in the Greater Yellowstone Area, USA. We found elk changed grouping patterns and increased movement rates as predation risk increased and that these behavioral changes were habitat dependent. Elk behavioral responses to wolf- and human-predation risk were similar; however, responses to human-predation risk were stronger than responses to wolf-predation risk. These results suggest that predation risk from wolves or human hunters may result in elk spending more time on private rangelands away from public-land winter ranges, which may exacerbate problems of landowner tolerance of elk on livestock pastures. However, increased movement and changing grouping patterns on winter ranges may also disperse elk grazing impacts and lessen elk impacts on any one area.

In the case of fear responses, animals can learn fearful or non-fearful responses by observing the behavior of conspecifics. Tonic immobility (TI) is an anti-predatory behavior elicited during intense fear situations. Studies have revealed that regular contact with humans can reduce TI responses in animals. In our study, we evaluated the effect of human contact on the TI responses in guinea pigs. We also evaluated the effect of cohabitation (non-fearful animals with fearful animals) on their TI responses. To achieve this, we measured the TI responses induced by postural inversion and restraint in guinea pigs as a result of different treatments. In our first experiment, we determined the effect of human contact on TI responses by establishing 3 treatment groups: no contact, handled, and habituated. In our second experiment, we addressed the effect of social learning on TI response by testing TI response in habituated, and unhabituated animals that had cohabitated for 10 days. In the first experiment, 10 days of either handling or habituation did not prevent TI in guinea pigs, but habituation did increase latency [F(2,119) = 14.19; p < 0.0001 1 and handling or habituation decrease duration [F(2,119) = 15.01; p < 0.0001] of the TI behavior in the guinea pigs. In the second experiment, the cohabitation of unhabituated and habituated animals reduced TI duration [F(2,93)=5.058; p <0.008]. These data suggest that both forms of human interaction can reduce experimenter fear in guinea pigs. It therefore seems that unhabituated guinea pigs learn not to fear the experimenter by cohabitating with habituated guinea pigs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In semi-natural situations affording a wide variety of responses, defensive behaviors change over time in response to information about the presence of danger, acquired through risk assessment activities. Two test batteries, a Fear/Defense Test Battery (F/DTB) measuring defensive behaviors to present, approaching predators, and an Anxiety/Defense Test Battery (A/DTB) measuring reactions to potential threat, have been used in conjunction with administration of potentially anxiolytic drugs. Results suggest that the F/DTB behaviors are not systematically responsive to anxiolytics. However, on the A/DTB, anxiolytic benzodiazepines produce a profile of effects primarily involving risk assessment activities. Very similar profiles of effect are seen also with some 5-HT1A compounds, alcohol, imipramine and MK-801, but not for a variety of additional compounds. A consistent pattern of gender differences are obtained with the A/DTB, with females more defensive than males. These results indicate that particular patterns of defensive behaviors may provide a very appropriate animal model for the analysis of pharmacological effects on anxiety.","UNIV HAWAII,DEPT SOCIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,BEKESY LAB NEUROBIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV LEEDS,DEPT PSYCHOL,LEEDS L52 0JT,ENGLAND; UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & REPROD BIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822",,,,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH042803] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA006220] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR03061] Funding Source: Medline; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [AA06220] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH42803] Funding Source: Medline,,,66,232,234,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4328,,,BEHAV BRAIN RES,Behav.

Here, we investigate how humans modify deer space-use and their effects on vegetation at two spatial scales; zones with different types of human use (largescale risk factor) and, nested within that, trails (fine-scale risk factor). In zones with three contrasting types of human activities: 1) no recreation, no hunting, 2) with recreation, no hunting and 3) with recreation and hunting, we linked deer space-use (dropping counts) to browsing intensity, relative growth and survival of planted saplings. Plots were located at two distances to trails (20 versus 100 m) to test how trails affect deer space-use and sapling performance. Additionally, plots were distributed over forest and heathland as risk effects are habitat-dependent. Deer space-use was highest in the zone without recreation or hunting, resulting in higher browsing levels and lower sapling growth and survival, but only in heathland. In contrast, deer space-use and sapling performance did not differ between zones with recreation only and zones with recreation and hunting. Deer dropping counts were lower near trails used for recreation, but this was not associated with browsing impact or sapling performance. Our results show that recreational use modifies deer space-use which is associated with browsing impact on woody vegetation, while seasonal hunting activities in zones with recreation did not have additive year-round effects. Yet, effects were only observed at the larger scale of recreation zones and not near trails. Furthermore, deer space-use was only associated with sapling performance in open heathland, where high visibility presumably increases avoidance behaviour because it increases detectability and decreases escape possibilities. This suggests that recreation creates behaviourally mediated cascading effects that influence vegetation development, yet these effects are context-dependent. We advocate incorporating human-induced fear effects in conservation, management and research.","[Mols, Bjorn; Lambers, Evert; Smit, Christian] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Conservat Ecol Grp, Groningen, Netherlands; [Cromsigt, Joris P.

For example, zebrafish showed a robust antipredatory reaction towards a sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish (Nandus nandus) but not towards an allopatric predator or sympatric or allopatric harmless fish species. In a subsequent study, however, we found zebrafish not to show avoidance in response to the image of another sympatric predator, Xenentodon cancila. The results implied that zebrafish may possess genetic predispositions that allow them to effectively evade at least certain sympatric predators without any prior exposure to them. However, it is not known whether zebrafish can respond to other sympatric predators with antipredatory reactions without any prior exposure to such predators. It is also not known whether such responses may be dependent upon, or idiosyncratic to, predator species. To answer these questions, we examined the effect of computer animated (moving) images of five different predator species all sympatric with zebrafish (Nandus nandus, Channa maculata, Xenentodon cancila, Mystus bleekeri, Chitala chitala) and of two abstract shapes (star and rectangle, also animated) on zebrafish behaviour. The results confirmed that the sight of N. nandus is an aversive stimulus and that the image of X. cancila is not. However, the results also revealed that images of three other species (C. maculata, M. bleekeri, C. chitala) and that of a rectangle induce even more robust aversive reactions than what is elicited by N. nandus. At this point we do not know what features of the images may be perceived as aversive by zebrafish or whether the observed behavioural responses would be adaptive or effective in nature. Nevertheless, we argue that image-presentation based fear paradigms will be useful in future translational research. We also conclude that it may be premature to decide whether zebrafish can recognize their sympatric predators.","[Ahmed, Tara S.; Fernandes, Yohaan; Gerlai, Robert] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",,"Gerlai, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Room 4023C,3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",robert_gerlai@yahoo.com,,"Ahmed, Tara/0000-0001-6848-488X",NSERC (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NIH/NIAAA (USA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA),This study was supported by NSERC (Canada) and NIH/NIAAA (USA) grants to R.G.,,27,24,24,2,29,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,,2012,149,10-12,,,SI,,1125,1153,,10.1163/1568539X-00003011,,,29,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,051FE,WOS:000312110800006,,,,,2022-04-19,

This trait is common among organisms living outside of the tropics. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) are small photoperiodic rodents which display a suite of adaptive responses to short day lengths, including reduced hippocampal volume, impairments in hippocampal-mediated memory, and enhanced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity. Because these photoperiodic changes in brain and behavior mirror some of the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we hypothesized that photoperiod may also alter fear memory and neuronal morphology within the hippocampus-basolateral amygdala-prefrontal cortex fear circuit. Ten weeks of exposure to short days increased fear memory in an auditory-cued fear conditioning test. Short days also increased dendritic spine density of the neurons of the basolateral amygdala, without affecting morphology of pyramidal neurons within the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex. Taken together, photoperiodic phenotypic changes in brain morphology and physiology induced by a single environmental factor, exposure to short day lengths, affect responses to fearful stimuli in white-footed mice. These results have potential implications for understanding seasonal changes in fear responsiveness, as well as for expanding translational animal models for studying gene-environment interactions underlying psychiatric diseases, such as PTSD.

Lions' ability to adjust their behaviour to reduce direct contact with humans may affect their survival. We used fine-scale GPS data to measure lions' response to humans at two scales: between land use types (commercial ranches versus pastoral lands) and with proximity to human-occupied locations (i.e. livestock enclosures: 'bomas') within commercial ranch land. Study lions on commercial ranches reacted to the location and activity levels of humans on the local scale, showing no overall spatial avoidance but fine-scale temporal partitioning in their use of areas in close proximity to bomas, being closest at times when human activity was lowest (i.e. between 2300 and 0500 hours). At the land use scale, however, lions showed significant (but not total) spatial avoidance of pastoral land, despite similar prey densities and habitat structure on both land use types, indicating that lions' ability to utilize pastoral land was limited by pastoral people. When lions did utilize pastoral land, they were more likely to do so during the dark hours, when people were confined to bomas, than during the daylight hours. Lions moved faster and straighter in pastoral lands and when close to bomas, indicating that they adjust 'how' they move in response to humans. They were found closer to bomas with increasing rainfall and decreasing moonlight. Overall, lion movements suggested an ability to partition their activities spatiotemporally with those of humans such that risk of human-caused mortality was minimized while use of a human-dominated landscape was maximized.

Studies frequently characterize sites as having an overall level of human disturbance, and compare how birds respond at sites with high and low levels of disturbance. Doing so assumes that disturbance has a fairly constant effect on animals throughout a site. We measured the distance at which individual Western Gulls (Larus occidentalis) moved away from an approaching observer along a stretch of beach on both sides of the Santa Monica Pier, a heavily visited tourist attraction in southern California. We found that these flight initiation distances decreased in areas where more people visited the beach, and specifically in a small area near the pier. We found that flight initiation distance changed very rapidly within a short distance from the pier. Our results indicate that anthropogenic features may leave a behavioral footprint. Identifying the scale of such behavioral footprints should be an important goal of studies that seek to reduce anthropogenic impacts on birds.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Webb, NV (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 621 Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244",,,,16,58,64,2,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,FEB,2005,107,1,,,,,178,181,,10.1650/7607,,,4,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,896UV,WOS:000226960300022,,,,,2022-04-19,

We first examined the effects of varying levels and types of human disturbance and activity on skink FID. We found that skinks flushed at significantly longer distances in areas with the least human activity. We then tested the degree to which skinks are able to discriminate different numbers of humans by comparing FID across three different types of approaches. Skinks did not significantly differentiate between a single approacher and a single approacher coming from a group of two other people, but did flush at greater distances when approached by three people simultaneously. Although skinks are not directly harvested or harassed by humans, they have refined human discrimination abilities.

When animals change their activities in response to a perceived threat, their energetic input may decline. Marine ecotourism, including whale and dolphin watching, is growing globally and cetaceans perceive interactions with tour vessels as a form of risk. Observable behavioural changes need to be linked to bioenergetic effects to determine the potential population consequences of this disturbance. We developed a theoretical optimal dive model for bottlenose dolphins under three potential types of perceived risk resulting from human interactions at the surface (decreasing instantaneous risk, increasing instantaneous risk and no risk). We compared the predictions of these theoretical models to observed dive cycles of foraging male and female dolphins in the presence and absence of tour vessels. We used mixture models to classify dive types and mixed effects models to analyse changes in the interbreath interval of surface and bottom dives and the frequency of estimated bottom dives. Males significantly increased bottom time and performed fewer bottom dives when boats were present, matching predictions of our theoretical model for perceived decreasing instantaneous risk. In contrast, females significantly decreased bottom times and increased the frequency of bottom dives, matching predictions from the model for perceived increasing instantaneous risk. Therefore, our empirical results suggest differences in the perception of risk between sexes.Synthesis and applications. By comparing theoretical predictions with observed dive data, our study suggests that boat interactions during foraging can cause decreased net energy gain over a foraging bout for both sexes, with females being more impacted. The population under study is currently listed as critically endangered. Understanding whether these predicted energetic impacts affect an individual's vital rates will provide a link to the population-level consequences of this disturbance. Previous analytical approaches have failed to capture the costs associated with disturbance during foraging, leading to management recommendations that only protect animals from increased energetic expenditure. We suggest that the current management scheme should be revised to include foraging areas in order to secure the energy intake of animals.

When people search for resources together, individuals often find themselves in a producer-scrounger game, in which some individuals bear the cost of risk monitoring while others can free ride on those efforts. A theoretically rational strategy is to mix foraging and risk monitoring randomly with the same probability across all members, but such uncoordinated action often yields inefficiencies of under- or over-supply of risk monitoring in a group. Here, we examined whether people could spontaneously develop a coordinated risk-monitoring system, alternating vigilance and foraging in a pair. Given that human cooperation is vulnerable to fear of exploitation and emotional arousal under risk, we hypothesized that such sources of anxiety would be potential disruptors to coordination. In a laboratory experiment, two participants worked on a treasure hunt task simultaneously, in which they chose between low or high vigilance against predators during foraging without verbal communication. If one chose high vigilance with personal cost, it yielded a spillover benefit to the other. Besides behavioral choices, each participant's physiological arousal (skin conductance response) and cognitive effort (tonic pupil dilation) were measured during the task. Results showed that some pairs were actually able to develop a role-alternating system over time through tacit coordination, but coordinated action was also vulnerable to anxiety and mistrust among participants. Overall, these results imply that, besides the mutual behavioral control that often characterizes repeated interaction, cognitive control of emotional arousal may be a critical psychological factor for the emergence of coordinated cooperation.","[Kuroda, Kiri; Kameda, Tatsuya] Univ Tokyo, Dept Social Psychol, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kuroda, Kiri] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Chiyoda Ku, 5-3-1 Kojimachi, Tokyo 1020083, Japan; [Kameda, Tatsuya] Hokkaido Univ, Ctr Expt Res Social Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Kameda, Tatsuya] Tamagawa Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Machida, Tokyo 1998610, Japan",,"Kameda, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Social Psychol, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",tkameda@l.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kuroda, Kiri/Q-8830-2019; Kuroda, Kiri/AAS-1585-2021","Kuroda, Kiri/0000-0001-7278-1430","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP16H06324]; Japan Science and Technology Agency CREST GrantJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) [JPMJCR17A4, 17941861]; Foundation for the Fusion of Science and Technology Grant; CiSHub at the University of Tokyo; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18J21510]","This research was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research JP16H06324, Japan Science and Technology Agency CREST Grant JPMJCR17A4 (17941861), JSPS Grant-in-Aid for JSPS fellows 18J21510, and Foundation for the Fusion of Science and Technology Grant.

We explore the influence of the Allee and fear effect on the existence of all positive equilibria. Furthermore, the local stability properties and possible bifurcation behaviors of the proposed system about positive equilibria are discussed with the help of trace and determinant values of the Jacobian matrix. With the help of Sotomayor's theorem, the conditions for existence of saddle-node bifurcation are derived. Also, we show that the proposed system admits limit cycle dynamics, and its stability is discussed with the value of first Lyapunov coefficient. Moreover, the numerical simulations including phase portrait, one- and two-parameter bifurcation diagrams are performed to validate our important findings.","[Vinoth, S.; Sivasamy, R.; Sathiyanathan, K.] SRMV Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Math, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Sivasamy, R.] M Kumarasamy Coll Engn, Dept Sci & Human, Karur, Tamil Nadu, India; [Unyong, Bundit; Vadivel, R.] Phuket Rajabhat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Phuket 83000, Thailand; [Rajchakit, Grienggrai] Maejo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Chiang Mai 50290, Thailand; [Gunasekaran, Nallappan] Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Math Sci, Saitama 3378570, Japan",,"Unyong, B (corresponding author), Phuket Rajabhat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Phuket 83000, Thailand.",bundit.u@pkru.ac.th,"Rajchakit, Grienggrai/K-7043-2014; S, Vinoth/AAT-7601-2021; , NALLAPPAN/AAA-4406-2020","Rajchakit, Grienggrai/0000-0001-6053-6219; S, Vinoth/0000-0002-4509-9484; , NALLAPPAN/0000-0003-0375-7917; R, Sivasamy/0000-0002-9784-2591",Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) [64A146000001],This article has been written with the financial support of Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) Grant Fund No. 64A146000001.,,44,0,0,10,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1687-1847,,,ADV DIFFER EQU-NY,Adv.

The aims of the present study were (a) a systematic investigation of the effect of regular daily handling on the fear reaction toward human beings both in domestic and in wild type rabbits, (b) to measure the long-term consequences of the handling, (c) to investigate whether the effective handling is linked to the nursing period, and (d) to see whether the effectivity of handling is confined to a sensitive period in the rabbit. We found that both domestic and wild rabbits are sensitive to human handling, especially when it is performed near the time of nursing. There was a sensitive period, the 1st week postpartum, in the effectiveness of handling. The animals handled in the sensitive period readily and repeatedly approached the observer, indicating the lack of fear. The effect of handling seemed long-lasting as handled females raised to adulthood were superior to non-handled individuals in their breeding performance. These results indicate that reduced fear of humans can be achieved via handling and this might be a prerequisite for studying the unbiased behavior of animals via direct observation.

Cetaceans are an example taxon where responsiveness to anthropogenic noise can be severe but highly species and context specific, with source-receiver characteristics such as hearing sensitivity only partially explaining this variability. Here, we predicted that ecoevolutionary factors that increase species responsiveness to predation risk also increase responsiveness to anthropogenic noise. We found that reductions in intense-foraging time during exposure to 1- to 4-kHz naval sonar and predatory killer whale sounds were highly correlated (r = 0.92) across four cetacean species. Northern bottlenose whales ceased foraging completely during killer whale and sonar exposures, followed by humpback, long-finned pilot, and sperm whales, which reduced intense foraging by 48 to 97%. Individual responses to sonar were partly predicted by species-level responses to killer whale playbacks, implying a similar level of perceived risk. The correlation cannot be solely explained by hearing sensitivity, indicating that species- and context-specific antipredator adaptations also shape cetacean responses to human-made noise. Species that are more responsive to predator presence are predicted to be more disturbance sensitive, implying a looming double whammy for Arctic cetaceans facing increased anthropogenic and predator activity with reduced ice cover.","[Miller, Patrick J.

Among the factors affecting FID, tests of effects of group size (i.e., number of potential prey) on FID have yielded contrasting results. Group size or flock size could either affect FID negatively (i.e., the dilution effect caused by the presence of many individuals) or positively (i.e., increased vigilance due to more eyes scanning for predators). These effects may be associated with gregarious species, because such species should be better adapted to exploiting information from other individuals in the group than nongregarious species. Sociality may explain why earlier findings on group size versus FID have yielded different conclusions. Here, we analyzed how flock size affected bird FID in eight European countries. A phylogenetic generalized least square regression model was used to investigate changes in escape behavior of bird species in relation to number of individuals in the flock, starting distance, diet, latitude, and type of habitat. Flock size of different bird species influenced how species responded to perceived threats. We found that gregarious birds reacted to a potential predator earlier (longer FID) when aggregated in large flocks. These results support a higher vigilance arising from many eyes scanning in birds, suggesting that sociality may be a key factor in the evolution of antipredator behavior both in urban and rural areas. Finally, future studies comparing FID must pay explicit attention to the number of individuals in flocks of gregarious species.","[Morelli, Federico; Benedetti, Yanina] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Appl Geoinformat & Spatial Planning, Prague, Czech Republic; [Diaz, Mario] CSIC, MNCN, BGC, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Madrid, Spain; [Grim, Tomas] Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Grim, Tomas] Palacky Univ, Lab Ornithol, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Ibanez-Alamo, Juan Diego] Univ Groningen, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Studies, Behav & Physiol Ecol Grp, Groningen, Netherlands; [Jokimaki, Jukka; Kaisanlahti-Jokimaki, Marja-Liisa] Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, Nat Inventory & EIA Serv, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Tatte, Kunter] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Zool, Tartu, Estonia; [Marko, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Hungarian Acad Sci, Ecol Res Grp, Budapest, Hungary; [Marko, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Behav Ecol Grp, Budapest, Hungary; [Marko, Gabor] Szent Istvan Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Budapest, Hungary; [Jiang, Yiting; Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Ecol Systemat Evolut,AgroParisTech, Orsay, France; [Tryjanowski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Poznan, Poland",,"Morelli, F (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Appl Geoinformat & Spatial Planning, Prague, Czech Republic.",fmorellius@gmail.com,"Marko, Gabor/AAX-1166-2020; Benedetti, Yanina/B-8815-2016; Morelli, Federico/P-1094-2018; Jokimäki, Jukka/L-4434-2013; Díaz, Mario/C-3052-2017; Grim, Tomas/A-2852-2008","Marko, Gabor/0000-0003-1351-4070; Benedetti, Yanina/0000-0003-1600-2310; Morelli, Federico/0000-0003-1099-1357; Jokimäki, Jukka/0000-0002-7903-4128; Díaz, Mario/0000-0002-6384-6674; Grim, Tomas/0000-0002-5775-6269; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797","Higher Education Institutional Excellence Program [1783-3/2018/FEKUTSTRAT]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [34-8]; Czech Science Foundation GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [18-16738S]","Higher Education Institutional Excellence Program, Grant/Award Number: 1783-3/2018/FEKUTSTRAT; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research, Grant/Award Number: 34-8; Czech Science Foundation GACR, Grant/Award Number: 18-16738S",,82,16,16,5,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We studied population variation in the incidence of fear screams and its correlation with habitat type using a habitat generalist bird species, the vinous-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis webbianus). Playback experiments were also conducted to determine how conspecifics respond to scream calls in this species. Overall, about 21 % of parrotbills consistently produced fear screams while being handled. Neither morphological traits nor flock size was related to screaming tendency, but females tended to scream more than males. The propensity to scream also differed significantly between geographic groups, and, interestingly, this difference was closely related to habitat type; parrotbills in closed habitats such as reedbeds or mountain forests screamed more frequently than those in open habitats. Playback experiments showed that fear screams successfully elicited rapid vocal and behavioral responses from conspecifics. Consistent with the attraction hypothesis, our study suggests that fear screams may function to gather both conspecifics and other species around the caller, which may directly or indirectly disturb the predator, thus giving the caller a chance to escape. The benefits of screaming may be influenced by environmental (e.g., habitat type) and biological (e.g., body mass) factors, which may ultimately account for the variability in propensity for screaming within and between species.","[Lee, Jin-Won; Lee, Jeong-Yeon; Noh, Hee-Jin; Kim, Myun-Sik; Kim, Kyoung-Hoe; Yoo, Jeong-Chil] Kyung Hee Univ, Korea Inst Ornithol, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Lee, Jin-Won; Lee, Jeong-Yeon; Noh, Hee-Jin; Kim, Myun-Sik; Kim, Kyoung-Hoe; Yoo, Jeong-Chil] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Biol, Seoul 130701, South Korea",,"Lee, JW (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Korea Inst Ornithol, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",jwlee99@khu.ac.kr,,,Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2012R1A6A3A04040003],"We thank Eun-Young Noh, Ki-Baek Nam, Sei-Woong Choi, and Tae-Ju Park sincerely for their valuable help in the field.

Hence, it is logical to study fear from the perspective of antipredator-survival behaviors and circuits by sampling a range of threatening situations that organisms are likely to encounter in the wild. In the past several decades, however, mainstream fear research has focused on the importance of associative learning; that is, how animals become frightened of innocuous cues as consequences of their contingent pairing with aversive events. While significant discoveries have been made, contemporary fear models derived from learning studies are likely to provide only a partial picture of the brain's fear system because they cannot simulate the dynamic range of risky situations in nature that require various adaptive actions and decisions. This review considers two different approaches to study fear, grounded on behaviorism and ethology and examines their contributions in revealing the naturalistic workings of fear in guiding and shaping behavior as animals make real-world choices.","[Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Jung, Min Whan] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Daejeon 34141, South Korea",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH099073]; Korean Federation of Science and Technology, Brain Pool Program; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH099073] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This manuscript preparation was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant MH099073 and the Korean Federation of Science and Technology, Brain Pool Program (J.J.K.).

Different nuclei of the amygdala mediate unconditioned and conditioned fear responses to threat in adult rats. The aim of this study was to determine the role of the amygdala in unlearned fear behavior in young rats. When exposed to an unfamiliar adult male rat, preweaning rat pups freeze, with peak levels on postnatal day 14 and declining levels on day 18. Pups were made anosmic to block olfactory input to the amygdala, and amygdala activation was assessed by quantifying the neuronal marker c-fos. Anosmic pups did not freeze in the presence of the male rat and had decreased c-fos expression in the medial amygdala on day 14 and in the medial and lateral amygdala on day 18. However, the decrease in freezing between days 14 and 18 was not associated with a decrease in c-fos expression in the medial amygdala. The medial and lateral amygdala were then inactivated by local muscimol infusion on day 14.

In the context of a predator, the postencounter reflects the initial detection of the potential threat, whereas the circa-strike is associated with direct predatory attack. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural organization of anticipation and avoidance of artificial predators with high or low probability of capturing the subject across analogous postencounter and circa-strike contexts of threat. Consistent with defense systems models, postencounter threat elicited activity in forebrain areas, including subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), hippocampus, and amygdala. Conversely, active avoidance during circa-strike threat increased activity in mid-dorsal ACC and midbrain areas. During the circa-strike condition, subjects showed increased coupling between the midbrain and mid-dorsal ACC and decreased coupling with the sgACC, amygdala, and hippocampus. Greater activity was observed in the right pregenual ACC for high compared with low probability of capture during circa-strike threat. This region showed decreased coupling with the amygdala, insula, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Finally, we found that locomotor errors correlated with subjective reports of panic for the high compared with low probability of capture during the circa-strike threat, and these panic-related locomotor errors were correlated with midbrain activity. These findings support models suggesting that higher forebrain areas are involved in early-threat responses, including the assignment and control of fear, whereas imminent danger results in fast, likely hard-wired, defensive reactions mediated by the midbrain.","[Mobbs, Dean] MRC, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England; [Mobbs, Dean] Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England; [Mobbs, Dean; Marchant, Jennifer L.; Hassabis, Demis; Seymour, Ben; Tan, Geoffrey; Gray, Marcus; Petrovic, Predrag; Dolan, Raymond J.; Frith, Christopher D.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1 3BG, England; [Petrovic, Predrag] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, S-7176 Stockholm, Sweden; [Frith, Christopher D.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Ctr Funct Integrat Neurosci, DK-800 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Gray, Marcus] Univ Sussex, Clin Imaging Sci Ctr, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Brighton BN1 9PX, E Sussex, England",,"Mobbs, D (corresponding author), MRC, 15 Chaucer Rd, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England.",dean.mobbs@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk,"Petrovic, Predrag/AAS-6736-2020; Gray, Marcus/F-6521-2013; Frith, Chris D/A-2171-2009","Petrovic, Predrag/0000-0002-5536-945X; Gray, Marcus/0000-0001-8671-6939; Frith, Chris D/0000-0002-8665-0690; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X; Seymour, Ben/0000-0003-1724-5832",Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission; Brain Research Trust Prize studentship; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission,"This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust research programme grants.

However, the costs of reproductive investment may mitigate predation risk aversion relative to periods when the link between reproductive output and prey behavior is weaker. We posit that intensity of reproductive investment in ungulates may predict their response to predation risk such that the sexes increase risk exposure during biological seasons that are pivotal to reproductive success, such as the fawn-rearing and breeding seasons for females and males, respectively. We examined the activity patterns of sympatric white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a sexually segregated polygynous ungulate, and Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) in the context of the risky times - risky places hypothesis and the reproductive strategy hypothesis. We compared detection rates and diel activity overlap of both species using motion-triggered camera traps positioned on (n = 120) and off (n = 60) anthropogenic trails across five reproductive seasons. Florida panthers were nocturnal and primarily observed on-trail providing an experimental framework with risky times and risky places. Contrary to studies in other taxa inversely correlating prey reproductive investment to predation risk, the sexes of deer were more risk prone during sex-specific seasons associated with intense reproductive investment. Our results suggest spatiotemporally variable predation risk influences sex-specific behavioral decision-making in deer such that reproductive success is maximized.","[Crawford, Daniel A.; Kelly, Brian D.; Chandler, Richard B.; Miller, Karl V.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Cherry, Michael J.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Garrison, Elina P.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Shindle, David B.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Immokalee, FL USA; [Conner, L.

However, to date there have been relatively few studies designed to assess the effects of PNS on anxiety, stress and fear responses, or the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a system clearly linked to stress and fear-related responses as well as neuropsychiatric disorders). In the current study, rats exposed to variable PNS were evaluated for anxiety-related behaviors in open field, elevated plus maze, and light/dark preference tasks. Innate fear responses were assessed using a predatory odor task and learned fear and extinction were assessed with a contextual fear conditioning task. As an indicator of HPA axis function, serum corticosterone levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay at various time points. The results indicated that PNS resulted in several behavioral anomalies including decreased innate fear responses to predator odor, impaired fear extinction, increased locomotor activity and stereotypic-like behaviors. Baseline levels of corticosterone in PNS subjects were similar to non-stressed controls; however, when exposed to acute stress, they exhibited an increase in corticosterone that was greater in magnitude. PNS was not associated with increased anxiety-like behaviors or deficits in learning or retention during contextual fear conditioning. Collectivity, these data support the argument that variable PNS in rats is a valid model system for studying some behavioral components of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the influence of stress hormones.

Many researchers studying the animal model of PTSD have adopted utilizing exposure to a predator as a life-threatening psychological stressor, to emulate the experience in humans, and the resulting body of literature has demonstrated numerous long-lasting neurological effects paralleling those in PTSD patients. Even though much more extreme, predator-induced fear and stress in animals in the wild was, until the 1990s, not thought to have any lasting effects, whereas recent experiments have demonstrated that the effects on free-living animals are sufficiently long-lasting to even affect reproduction, though the lasting neurological effects remain unexplored. We suggest neuroscientists and ecologists both have much to gain from collaborating in studying the neurological effects of predator-induced fear and stress in animals in the wild. We outline the approaches taken in the lab that appear most readily translatable to the field, and detail the advantages that studying animals in the wild can offer researchers investigating the predator model of PTSD.","[Clinchy, Michael] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; [Schulkin, Jay] Georgetown Univ, Dept Neurosci, Washington, DC USA; [Zanette, Liana Y.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Sheriff, Michael J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK USA; [McGowan, Patrick O.; Boonstra, Rudy] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Ctr Neurobiol Stress, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Clinchy, M (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, POB 3020 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",mclinchy@uvic.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Tony D.

Thus, the risk perception of predation shapes the cost-benefit decisions associated with food and safety in animal communities. Even non-consumptive human-related activities such as ecotourism may influence species behavioural traits. Marine wildlife tourism might produce different impacts on organisms, stressing and modifying (directly or indirectly) species behaviour, physiology and habitat use. Understand the effects of human presence on site-attached fish' behaviour is crucial to elucidate how dive-tourism could shape their limited-range seascape. Given the importance of the territorial damselfishes as reef farmers and 'ecosystems engineers', here we investigated if the presence of SCUBA divers and snorkelers can disrupt the foraging and territorial defence of the Dusky damselfish, Stegastes fuscus. Experimental approaches (diver presence and absence) were applied in 30 territories of S. fuscus using underwater remote video cameras. Behavioural responses were analysed by considering the frequency of refuge, foraging and chase behaviours. Both recreational dive activities had an analogous role in frighten and disturb the Dusky damselfish activities. Considering the frequency of behaviours displayed in diver's absence vs presence, S. fuscus increased its refuge times from approximately 2% to 50% on SCUBA diver presence and from 9% to 43% in snorkeler presence. It is directly linked to the missed feeding opportunities, which reduced by half during both diver's presence. Damselfish's aggressiveness proportionally dropped (0.3%) during SCUBA diver presence but increased (2.4%) while snorkeler was present. However, the average frequency of chase behaviour reduced with both divers' approach. Interruptions in damselfish behaviour may modify the resource monopolization and productivity inside their territories, affecting its relationships with other species beyond the boundaries of their territoriality, and leading a possible change on its functional role in the reef community. Territorial reef fish behaviour and their relationship with divers' presence can provide a more holistic comprehension regarding the seascape of fear concept and could be useful as an indicator of human disturbances.","[Benevides, Larissa J.] Univ Fed Alagoas UFAL, ICBS, Programa Posgrad Diversidade Biol & Conservacao T, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil; [Cardozo-Ferreira, Gabriel C.] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, Lab Ictiol, Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Ferreira, Carlos Eduardo L.] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, LECAR, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Pereira, Pedro Henrique C.] Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, CTG, Dept Oceanog, Cidade Univ, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Pinto, Taciana K.] Univ Fed Alagoas UFAL, Lab Ecol Benton, Programa Posgrad Diversidade Biol & Conservacao T, ICBS,UE Penedo, Campus Arapiraca, Penedo, Alagoas, Brazil; [Sampaio, Claudio Luis S.] Univ Fed Alagoas UFAL, Lab Ictiol & Conservacao, Programa Posgrad Diversidade Biol & Conservacao T, ICBS,UE Penedo, Campus Arapiraca, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil",,"Benevides, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Fed Alagoas UFAL, ICBS, Programa Posgrad Diversidade Biol & Conservacao T, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil.",benevideslai@gmail.com; gabrielccf@gmail.com; carlosferreira@id.uff.br; pedrohcp2@yahoo.com.br; taciana@penedo.ufal.br; claudio.sampaio@penedo.ufal.br,"Pinto, Taciana K/P-2159-2016; Cardozo-Ferreira, Gabriel Costa/D-5852-2014","Cardozo-Ferreira, Gabriel Costa/0000-0002-3960-2266; Sampaio, Claudio/0000-0002-0389-2302; Pinto, Taciana/0000-0002-8295-7206; Ferreira, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-4311-0491",CAPES - Coordination for the Improvement of Higher EducationCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); FAPES Foundation for research support of Espirito Santo State; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPERJFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ); FUNBIO,"We thank J-C Joyeux for the valuable comments on the manuscript.

Thus, wild animals living in urban areas are forced to invest more time and energy in defence behaviours, which depend on how the risk is perceived and assessed. We experimentally tested whether Burrowing owls coming from rural and urban habitats showed differences in behavioural responses when facing humans and domestic dogs. We measured flight initiation distances (FIDs), nest returning, and aggressiveness level when owls faced a human and a human with a dog walking towards them. Our results showed that urban owls recognise a human with a dog as a greater threat than a human alone, thus indicating that fear of domestic animals should be considered as affecting owls' settlement in cities and towns. On the other hand, rural owls perceived human and dogs as similar threats, but showed higher FIDs, less aggressiveness, and lower tendency to return to the nest than urban owls in both treatments. These findings emphasize the importance of modified habitats in modelling the response of urban and rural owls to predators and represent another step in the explanation of how wild animals assess and respond to threats associated with living in urbanized environments.

Most of these studies used schematic drawings, images, or pictures of snakes, and only a small amount of fieldwork in naturalistic environments was done. We address fear preparedness theories and automatic fast detection data from mainstream laboratory data and compare it with ethobehavioral information relative to snakes, predatorprey interaction, and snakes' defensive kinematics strikes in order to analyze their potential matching. From this analysis, four main findings arose, namely that (1) snakebites occur when people are very close to the snake and are unaware or unable to escape the bite; (2) human visual detection and escape response is slow compared to the speed of snake strikes; (3) in natural environments, snake experts are often unable to see snakes existing nearby; (4) animate objects in general capture more attention over other stimuli and dangerous, but recent objects in evolutionary terms are also able to be detected fast. The issues mentioned above pose several challenges to evolutionary psychology-based theories expecting to find special-purpose neural modules. The older selective habituation hypothesis (Schleidt, 1961) that prey animals start with a rather general predator image from which specific harmless cues are removed by habituation might deserve reconsideration.","[Coelho, Carlos M.; Suttiwan, Panrapee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Dept Psychol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Faiz, Abul M.] Dev Care Fdn, Dept Psychol, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Ferreira-Santos, Fernando] Univ Porto, Dept Psychol, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Lab Neuropsychophysiol, Porto, Portugal; [Zsido, Andras N.] Univ Pecs, Inst Psychol, Dept Gen & Evolutionary Psychol, Pecs, Hungary",,"Zsido, AN (corresponding author), Univ Pecs, Inst Psychol, Dept Gen & Evolutionary Psychol, Pecs, Hungary.",zsido.andras@pte.hu,"Zsido, Andras/AAC-6489-2019; Ferreira-Santos, Fernando/L-5994-2013; Coelho, Carlos/A-5065-2010","Ferreira-Santos, Fernando/0000-0002-2656-5291; Coelho, Carlos/0000-0002-2320-7931","Rachadapisek Sompote Fund for Postdoctoral Fellowship, Chulalongkorn University; New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities [UNKP-18-3-IV-PTE-9]; European UnionEuropean Commission; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Comprehensive Development for Implementing Smart Specialization Strategies at the University of Pecs [EFOP-3.6.1.-16-2016-00004]","This research was supported by the Rachadapisek Sompote Fund for Postdoctoral Fellowship, Chulalongkorn University.

Our laboratory previously reported that lymphocyte deficient Rag2(-/-) mice on a BALB/c background display resilience to maladaptive stress responses when compared with immune competent mice in the predator odor exposure (POE) paradigm, while exhibiting similar behavior in a cued fear-conditioning (FC) paradigm. In the present study, Rag2(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 background were assessed in the same behavioral paradigms, as well as additional tests of anxiety and depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, the effects of naive CD4(+) T cells were evaluated by adoptive transfer of functional cells from nonstressed, wild-type donors to Rag2(-/-) mice. Consistent with our prior results, Rag2(-/-) mice displayed an attenuated startle response after POE. Nevertheless, reconstitution of Rag2(-/-) mice with CD4(+) T cells did not modify startle reactivity. Additionally, in contrast with our previous findings, Rag2(-/-) mice showed attenuated fear responses in the FC paradigm compared to wild-type mice and reconstitution with CD4(+) T cells promoted fear learning and memory. Notably, reconstitution with CD4(+) T cells had anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in Rag2(-/-) mice that had not been previously stressed, but had no effect after POE. Taken together, our results support a role of CD4(+) T cells in emotionality, but also indicate that they may promote fear responses by enhancing learning and memory processes.","[Clark, Sarah M.; Soroka, Jennifer A.; Song, Chang; Li, Xin; Tonelli, Leonardo H.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Lab Behav Neuroimmunol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Clark, Sarah M.; Tonelli, Leonardo H.] VA Maryland Hlth Care Syst, Res & Dev Serv, Dept Vet Affairs, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Clark, SM (corresponding author), 685 West Baltimore St,MSTF 934-E, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",sclark@psych.umaryland.edu,,,"Department of Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [BX00935]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH097676]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH103222, R01MH097676] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01BX000935] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by Department of Veterans Affairs (VA Merit Review Award BX00935) and the NIMH (OppNet R01MH097676) to LHT.,,25,17,17,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1025-3890,1607-8888,,STRESS,Stress,MAY,2016,19,3,,,,,303,311,,10.1080/10253890.2016.1191466,,,9,Behavioral Sciences; Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences & Neurology,DQ0WI,WOS:000378922100005,27295202,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-19,

EDCs affect both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors because hormones mediate responses associated with aggression and fear. We examined the effects of two EDCs on risk-taking behaviors in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We quantified risk-taking in terms of propensity to forage in a risky location and tendency to join groups in the presence of a predator. We found that male and female guppies responded oppositely to environmentally relevant concentrations of an estrogenic EDC, 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2), or an androgenic EDC, 17-trenbolone (TB). Males decreased risk-taking with increasing EE2 concentration (as predicted), but females increased risk-taking (contrary to prediction). In contrast, females increased risk-taking with increasing TB concentrations (as predicted), but males decreased risk-taking (contrary to prediction). These results did not match our expectation that EE2 would reduce risk-taking and TB would increase risk-taking in both sexes. We suspect EE2 and TB produced these counterintuitive effects by downregulating their corresponding hormone receptors and thus reducing levels of circulating endogenous hormones in females and males, respectively. These results show that EDCs can alter fish behavior and potentially reduce fitness in unexpected ways.","[Heintz, Melissa M.; Brander, Susanne M.; White, James W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",,"Heintz, MM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, 601 S Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.",mmh2054@alum.uncw.edu,,"Heintz, Melissa/0000-0002-8931-617X",University of North Carolina Wilmington Center for Marine Science,"This research was funded by the University of North Carolina Wilmington Center for Marine Science, and we thank the Center for use of their environmental chamber.

However, few studies have examined how natural predation risk factors interact with human-disturbance stimuli to elicit such responses. We observed American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) vigilance behavior from September-December 2002 on the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina. A set of models was constructed based on 340 focal-animal samples and models revealed relationships between vigilance behavior, predator density, and boat activity. Oystercatchers increased vigilance in response to aerial predators, particularly late in the season when predator species composition was dominated by Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus). At a broader temporal scale, oystercatchers exhibited the highest vigilance rates during simultaneous peaks in boating disturbance and Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) activity. Due to this temporal overlap of stimuli, it is difficult to interpret what may have been driving the observed increased in vigilance. Foraging rates appeared to be primarily driven by habitat and tidal stage indicating that time lost to vigilance did not effectively reduce intake. Taken together, these findings provide some support for the risk-disturbance hypothesis, underscore the sensitivity of disturbance studies to temporal scale, and draw attention to the potential confounding effects of natural predation risk.","Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, USGS S Carolina Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, USGS Iowa Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Ames, IA 50011 USA",,"Peters, KA (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, USGS S Carolina Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",kapeter@clemson.edu,,,,,,59,20,21,1,29,COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,AUG,2005,107,3,,,,,716,725,,10.1650/0010-5422(2005)107[0716:UTRHTA]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,954ZP,WOS:000231194500023,,,,,2022-04-19,

This study examined cross-cultural and interpersonal differences in behavioural immune system measured by disgust, fear and perceived danger in participants from high (Turkey) and low (Slovakia) pathogen prevalence areas. We found that behavioural immune system in Turkish participants was activated more than those of Slovakian participants when exposed to photographs depicting disease-relevant cues, but not when exposed to disease-irrelevant cues. However, participants from Slovakia, where human to human disease transmission is expected to be more prevalent than in Turkey, showed lower aversion in Germ Aversion subscale supporting hypersensitiveness of the behavioural immune system. Having animals at home was less frequent both in Turkey and in participants who perceived higher danger about disease relevant animals. Participants more vulnerable to diseases reported higher incidence of illness last year and considered perceived disease-relevant animals more dangerous than others. Females showed greater fear, disgust and danger about disease-relevant animals than males.

Although optimality models predict the distance at which an animal should initiate vigilance and flight, many studies have shown that animals generally flee soon after detecting an approaching threat, supporting the 'flush early and avoid the risk' (FEAR) hypothesis. Despite this, flight behaviour varies markedly depending on context, suggesting some behavioural plasticity in the response of prey to a given threat. We evaluated the degree of plasticity in the flight responses of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, a highly flexible species which thrives in human-dominated landscapes. Based on individually identifiable animals and a standardized flight initiation protocol, we measured the distance at which a deer detected an approaching threat, and the distance at which it subsequently initiated flight. Our results provide strong support for the FEAR hypothesis, suggesting that alert and flight responses are strongly coupled in roe deer. However, the perceived level of both risk (in terms of landscape openness and proximity to human infrastructure) and reward (in terms of habitat quality) influenced the time it took for a deer to detect an approaching threat, and the subsequent time for which the threat was tolerated prior to flight. Overall, our findings indicate that although roe deer minimize monitoring costs when assessing risk by fleeing early, they also adjust their monitoring and flight responses to the local risk-resource trade-off.

Unlike other predators, human hunters are often more spatially and temporally restricted, which creates a period of short-duration, high-intensity predation risk for prey. Consequently, identifying the roles different hunting modes (i.e., archery and rifle), hunts for targeted and non-targeted species, and landscape features play in altering spatial and temporal responses of prey to predation risk by humans is important for effective management of harvested populations. From 2009 to 2016, we used a large-scale experiment including 50 animal-years of location data from 38 unique male elk (Cervus canadensis) to quantify changes in movement and resource selection in response to hunters during 3 separate 5-day controlled hunts for antlered males (elk archery, deer [Odocoileus spp.] rifle, and elk rifle) at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range in northeast Oregon, USA. We evaluated competing hypotheses regarding elk responses to varying levels of prey risk posed by the different hunt types. We predicted that the strength of elk behavioral responses would increase with perceived hunter lethality (i.e., weak response to elk archery but similar response to elk and deer rifle hunts) and that prey response would be closely associated with hunter activity within the diel cycle (greater during diurnal than nocturnal hours) and across hunting seasons. Elk responses were strongest during diurnal hours when hunters were active on the landscape and were generally more pronounced during both rifle hunts than during the archery hunt (supporting our perceived lethality hypothesis). Male elk avoided open roads across all periods except during nocturnal hours of the breeding season and alternated between avoidance of areas with high canopy cover during nocturnal hours and selection during diurnal hours. In combination these patterns led to distinct distributional changes of male elk from pre-hunt to hunt periods. Patterns of male elk selection highlight the importance of managing for heterogeneous landscapes to meet a variety of habitat, harvest, hunter satisfaction, and escapement objectives.","[Smith, Joshua B.; Brown, Casey L.; Forrester, Tavis D.; Johnson, Bruce K.; Clark, Darren A.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, 1401 Gekeler Lane, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Spitz, Derek B.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Wisdom, Michael J.; Rowland, Mary M.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, 1401 Gekeler Lane, La Grande, OR 97850 USA",,"Smith, JB (corresponding author), Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, 1401 Gekeler Lane, La Grande, OR 97850 USA.",Joshua.b.smith@odfw.oregon.gov,,"Spitz, Derek/0000-0002-1282-3886; Rowland, Mary/0000-0001-5766-8683; Clark, Darren/0000-0002-8738-9826; Forrester, Tavis/0000-0001-6762-4115; Brown, Casey/0000-0002-3901-7286","Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife; Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Act; USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service","USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station; Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Act; Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife",,67,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,1937-2817,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

This is particularly important for large carnivores as their interactions with people are often a source of conflict, which can impede conservation efforts and require extensive management. To examine the adaptations of a large carnivore to benefits and risks associated with human development we investigated black bear behavior in three systems in the western United States. Our objectives were to (1) identify temporal patterns of selection for development within a year and across years based on natural food conditions, (2) compare spatial patterns of selection for development across systems, and (3) examine individual characteristics associated with increased selection for development. Using mixed effects resource selection models we found that bear selection for development was highly dynamic, varying as a function of changing environmental and physiological conditions. Bears increased their use of development in years when natural foods were scarce, throughout the summer-fall, as they aged, and as a function of gender, with males exhibiting greater use of development. While patterns were similar across systems, bears at sites with poorer quality habitat selected development more consistently than bears at sites with higher quality habitat. Black bears appear to use development largely for food subsidy, suggesting that conflicts with bears, and potentially other large carnivores, will increase when the physiological demand for resources outweighs risks associated with human activity.

Responses to humans and non-human predators may covary due to common mechanisms enforcing a phenotypic correlation. However, while increased tolerance toward humans may be advantageous for urban animals, reduced vigilance toward non-human predators that can pose actual threat may be costly. Therefore, urban animals may benefit from showing specific responses to different threat levels, such as humans versus non-human predators, or hostile versus non-hostile humans. To test these alternatives, we compared responses (latencies to return to nest) of urban and forest-breeding great tits (Parus major) to familiar hostile and unfamiliar humans as well as one of their common predators, the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). We found that urban birds were more risk-taking toward both humans and sparrowhawk than forest birds. However, responses to sparrowhawk did not correlate with responses to humans either within or across habitats. This suggests that higher risk-taking of urban compared to forest-dwelling great tits toward sparrowhawk may be threat-specific response to lower predation risk rather than a spillover effect of increased tolerance to humans. Furthermore, birds responded similarly to unfamiliar and familiar (potentially dangerous) humans in both habitats, suggesting that great tits may not adjust their risk-taking to the threat represented by individual humans. These findings indicate that urban birds may flexibly adjust their risk-taking to certain, but not all, types of threat.","[Vincze, Erno; Pipoly, Ivett; Liker, Andras] Univ Pannonia, MTA PE Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, POB 158, H-8201 Veszprem, Hungary; [Seress, Gabor; Liker, Andras] Univ Pannonia, Dept Limnol, Veszprem, Hungary; [Preiszner, Balint] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Res, Balaton Limnol Inst, Tihany, Hungary; [Papp, Sandor] Balaton Uplands Natl Pk Directorate, Csopak, Hungary; [Nemeth, Brigitta] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Bokony, Veronika] Hungarian Acad Sci, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Plant Protect Inst, Ctr Agr Res, Budapest, Hungary",,"Vincze, E (corresponding author), Univ Pannonia, MTA PE Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, POB 158, H-8201 Veszprem, Hungary.",ernovincze@almos.uni-pannon.hu,"Preiszner, Bálint/AAB-7659-2020; Vincze, Ern?/Q-8857-2018; Bókony, Veronika/AAH-7679-2020","Preiszner, Bálint/0000-0002-3352-2169; Vincze, Ern?/0000-0002-2493-5551; Bókony, Veronika/0000-0002-2136-5346; Pipoly, Ivett/0000-0002-4541-6056; Seress, Gabor/0000-0001-9828-4934","Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary [UNKP-17-3, UNKP-2016-3]; Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office [NKFIH K112838, NKFIH PD 120998, OTKA K84132]; Hungarian Academy of SciencesHungarian Academy of Sciences; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF) [TAMOP-4.2.2.A-11/1/KONV-2012-0064, TAMOP-4.2.4.A/2-11/1-2012-0001]","Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary, Grant/Award Number: UNKP-17-3 and UNKP-2016-3; Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office, Grant/Award Number: NKFIH K112838, NKFIH PD 120998 and OTKA K84132; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; European Social Fund, Grant/Award Number: TAMOP-4.2.2.A-11/1/KONV-2012-0064 and TAMOP-4.2.4.A/2-11/1-2012-0001",,87,9,10,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,OCT,2019,125,10,,,,,686,701,,10.1111/eth.12922,,JUL 2019,16,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,IV9ZH,WOS:000476357500001,,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-19,

Ungulate prey can use increased vigilance to reduce their risk of predation, but little is known of the combined and interactive risk effects from humans and wolves in determining ungulate behaviour across time and space. Understanding the interplay between these risk effects is increasingly important, considering the recolonisation of several large carnivores to more human-dominated landscapes in Europe. Aim. The aim of the present study was to assess the vigilance behaviour expressed by red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to both humans and wolves in the Polish Bialowiez. a Forest. Methods. Using a camera-trap transect, the effect of distance to human settlements, hunting season, patterns of space use by wolves (Canis lupus), canopy openness, canopy height, time of day, as well as sex/age of individuals, on the vigilance behaviour observed in red deer was studied using a model-selection approach. Key results. We did not find a clear effect of patterns of space use by wolves or distance to human settlements on red deer vigilance behaviour at the landscape scale. However, red deer showed increased vigilance during the hunting season and during the day outside of protected areas and reserves, because disturbance from human hunters is highest. Conversely, we also found that red deer were more vigilant at night within more protected areas, which is likely to be explained by the increased activity of wolves because human activity is strictly limited. Conclusions. Our study showed that vigilance behaviour of red deer in Bialowiez. a Primeval Forest is more driven by human hunting than by the frequency of wolf presence at a landscape scale. This could be explained by the higher temporal and spatial predictability of human hunting activities than wolf risk. We found that patterns of wolf space use, as opposed to the omnipresent fear effects from humans, had only localised effects by increasing vigilance levels during night hours in non-hunting areas of the forest. The reverse was observed outside of protected reserves. Understanding how prey species respond to this new combination of risk from natural predators and humans, is increasingly important in a landscape where human risk is becoming ever more potent and carnivores recolonise.","[Proudman, Nathan J.; Churski, Marcin; Bubnicki, Jakub W.; Kuijper, Dries P.

Recently, it has been suggested that hunting for fear might help maximize nonconsumptive effects of hunting and their cascading impacts. We investigated how a predator-free black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis Merriam, 1898) population introduced to the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada) responded to short-term hunting for fear. We conducted a hunt that minimized killing and maximized scaring on an island where some deer were marked. Between control and hunted sites, we compared deer use of bait stations and of shoreline areas (i.e., an open and risky area that provided marine subsidies). We also compared the browsing pressure and growth of two grasses and two shrubs. Hunting for fear had no effect on the overall use of bait stations and shorelines. However, in the area exposed to hunting, unmarked deer, which were assumed to be less tolerant of human disturbance, avoided bait stations at the outset of hunting. We concluded that individuals perceive and respond to risk differently. Furthermore, two of the four plant species were less likely to be browsed and had better growth in the experimental area than in the control area, suggesting an indirect effect of hunting on plants mediated by deer behaviour.","[Le Saout, Soizic; Padie, Sophie; Chamaille-Jammes, Simon; Chollet, Simon; Martin, Jean-Louis] CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Le Saout, Soizic; Padie, Sophie; Chollet, Simon] Univ Montpellier 2, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Cote, Steve] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Cote, Steve] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Morellet, Nicolas] INRA, Comportement & Ecol Faune Sauvage, 24 Chemin Borde Rouge,BP CS 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Pattison, Jake; Harris, Erin] Laskeek Bay Conservat Soc Off, RGIS, Queen Charlotte, BC VOT 1SO, Canada",,"Chamaille-Jammes, S (corresponding author), CNRS, CEFE, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",simon.chamaille@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Morellet, Nicolas/AAC-3278-2019; Martin, Jean-Louis/E-5059-2010; Chamaillé-Jammes, Simon/B-3833-2009","Chamaillé-Jammes, Simon/0000-0003-0505-6620; Morellet, Nicolas/0000-0002-4274-7044",Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [2010-BLAN-1718]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Canadian government,"This study was funded by project 2010-BLAN-1718 (BAMBI) of the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, the Groupement de Recherche International Dynamique de la biodiversite et traits d'histoire de vie from Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the Understanding Canada program from the Canadian government.

This paper describes competition between modern humans and large carnivores in rural Uganda, including active, confrontational scavenging of carnivore kills by humans and carnivore attacks on humans. Information gathered from Ugandan Game Department archives (1923-1994) reveals that twentieth-century agropastoralists regularly tried to scavenge from leopard (Panthera pardus) and lion (Panthera lee) kills, and that these large carnivores have preyed on hundreds of humans in Uganda over the past several decades. Men were most often targets of carnivore attack, particularly while engaged in hunting-related activities. However attacks on men were less often lethal than attacks on women and children. Analyses show that lion attacks were more dangerous than leopard attacks. These data support recent contentions that hominids armed with even simple weapons can succeed in active, confrontational scavenging by chasing carnivores from kills. Hominids sharing East African habitats with large carnivores may have been regularly subject to attack.

Increasing visitation, however, can compromise ecological integrity. A fundamental conundrum is that if parks are to serve as our most pristine places, then we must understand how human presence alters biological interactions. Species that redistribute themselves closer to people is of growing management concern both in and out of national parks because of 1) human safety, 2) animal health, and 3) ecological consequences. Drivers of distributional change are often dissimilar but may include increased association with people for predator avoidance - the human shield hypothesis. We examine redistribution patterns with comparative, observational, and experimental approaches contrasting ecological responses of an iconic species in an USA national park - Glacier. Specifically, we focused on the role of predator-avoidance and resource enhancement to test whether a cold-adapted alpine obligate, mountain goats, (Oreamnos americanus), mediate their distribution by increasing spatial overlap with humans. Individuals that enhanced mineral acquisition through access to human urine concomitantly reduced behavioral and ecological responses to grizzly bear (Ursus arctos hornbilis) experiments. Goats near people also displayed reduced group sizes, vigilance, use of escape terrain, and forfeited migrations to naturally occurring minerals. Our findings re-enforce the increasing complexities of natural area management because visitation is altering ecological interactions. While protected areas offer some forms of baselines for scientists and enjoyment for millions of visitors, redistribution of species and associated ecological changes signifies that additional care will be needed in what we perceive as pristine and what is anthropogenically-altered.","[Sarmento, Wesley M.] Univ Montana, Nat Sci 205, Wildlife Biol Program, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Colorado State Univ, Barbara Cox Anthony Chair FWC Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA",,"Sarmento, WM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Nat Sci 205, Wildlife Biol Program, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",wmsarmento@gmail.com,,,National Park Service; Federal Highway Administration; Jerry O'Neil Fellowship; Wyss Scholarship; Sigma-Xi,"This project was funded by the National Park Service, Federal Highway Administration, the Jerry O'Neil Fellowship, Wyss Scholarship, and a Sigma-Xi Grants-in-Aid Award.

Here, we review recent pioneering advances in behavioral studies with optogenetic tools, focusing on mechanisms of fear-related behavioral processes with an emphasis on approaches which could be used to suppress fear when it is pathologically expressed.

Studies have focused on human selection of morphological traits, but little is known about human selection of behavioural traits. By monitoring elk (Cervus elaphus) with satellite telemetry, we tested whether individuals harvested by hunters adopted less favourable behaviours than elk that survived the hunting season. Among 45 2-year-old males, harvested elk showed bolder behaviour, including higher movement rate and increased use of open areas, compared with surviving elk that showed less conspicuous behaviour. Personality clearly drove this pattern, given that inter-individual differences in movement rate were present before the onset of the hunting season. Elk that were harvested further increased their movement rate when the probability of encountering hunters was high ( close to roads, flatter terrain, during the weekend), while elk that survived decreased movements and showed avoidance of open areas. Among 77 females (2-19 y.o.), personality traits were less evident and likely confounded by learning because females decreased their movement rate with increasing age. As with males, hunters typically harvested females with bold behavioural traits. Among less-experienced elk (2-9 y.o.), females that moved faster were harvested, while elk that moved slower and avoided open areas survived. Interestingly, movement rate decreased as age increased in those females that survived, but not in those that were eventually harvested. The latter clearly showed lower plasticity and adaptability to the local environment. All females older than 9 y.o. moved more slowly, avoided open areas and survived.

This diversity of threats is matched by a set of universal and species specific defensive behaviors which are often subsumed under the emotions of fear and anxiety. A major issue in the field of affective science, however, is that these emotions are often conflated and scientists fail to reflect the ecological conditions that gave rise to them. I attempt to clarify these semantic issues by describing the link between ethologically defined defensive strategies and fear. This in turn, provides a clearer differentiation between fears, the contexts that evoke them and how they are organized within defensive survival circuits.","[Mobbs, Dean] CALTECH, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, 1200 E Calif Blvd,HSS 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Mobbs, Dean] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst Program, 1200 E Calif Blvd,HSS 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,"Mobbs, D (corresponding author), CALTECH, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, 1200 E Calif Blvd,HSS 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.; Mobbs, D (corresponding author), CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst Program, 1200 E Calif Blvd,HSS 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",dmobbs@caltech.edu,,,National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) grant [2P50MH094258]; Chen Institute Award [P2026052]; NARSADNARSAD; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH094258] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"I wish to thank Ralph Adolphs and Joe LeDoux for their advice.

We tested the human shield hypothesis in a population of mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni) subjected to predation from the nocturnal spotted hyena (Crocuta Crocuta) in the Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia by radio-marking 15 mountain nyala (seven females and eight males) and tracking them for up to 2yr. Occurrence of hyena estimated by faecal transects decreased close to human settlements substantiating the occurrence of a zone with lower risk of hyena predation. The diurnal pattern in the average distance between mountain nyala relocations and human settlements was consistent with the human shield hypothesis with significantly shorter distances during night (when exposed to predation) than during day. However, mountain nyala showed large individual heterogeneity in use of human shields. While nearly all individuals occasionally moved out of the park to human settlements during night, the frequency of such excursions varied from 0% to 71%. The excursions occurred year-round and were not driven by seasonal access to crops. We have previously demonstrated a strong negative effect of humans on the large-scale distribution pattern of mountain nyala. The use of human shield documented here is indicative of a positive small-scale effect of humans. Our study thus supports the view that the effect of human-wildlife interactions can be scale-dependent.","[Atickem, Anagaw; Stenseth, Nils Chr] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, CEES, Oslo, Norway; [Loe, Leif Egil] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway",,"Loe, LE (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway.",leif.egil.loe@nmbu.no,"Loe, Leif Egil/M-5798-2016; Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016","Loe, Leif Egil/0000-0003-4804-2253; Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399",Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES); International Foundation for Science (IFS)International Foundation for Science,"We thank Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES) and International Foundation for Science (IFS) providing funding to purchase collars.

Conflict between people and large carnivores is an urgent conservation issue world-wide. Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of livestock depredation by large carnivores is greatly needed. 2. We studied the spatial, foraging and behavioural ecology of African lions Panthera leo in the Botswana Makgadikgadi ecosystem. This ecosystem comprises a protected area, characterized by high seasonal fluctuation in wild prey abundance, and adjacent lands, which are used for livestock grazing and characterized by stable livestock abundance, but also a risk of anthropogenic mortality. 3. Makgadikgadi lions preferentially preyed upon migratory wild herbivores when they were present; however, data from GPS (Global Positioning System) radiocollared lions revealed that the majority of the study lions did not follow the migratory herds but remained resident at one or other border of the park and switched to livestock (abundant and readily available), and to a lesser extent resident wild herbivores (relatively scarce), in periods of migratory wild herbivore scarcity. 4. Resident lions' use of space differed between periods of wild prey abundance and scarcity. These changes were likely to increase the frequency of encounter with their primary prey in periods of primary prey abundance and with livestock in periods of primary prey scarcity. 5. The risk of conflict with humans was a major driver of lion ecology in the human-dominated landscape surrounding the protected area. Resident lions generally avoided the close vicinity of cattle-posts. When they used such areas, they avoided temporal overlap with periods that humans were most active and travelled at high speed reducing the time spent in these areas. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study suggests that lions balance the benefits of accessing livestock with the costs associated with livestock raiding. Hence, reduction in livestock availability through effective livestock husbandry in periods of wild prey scarcity should lead to reduced conflict.","[Valeix, Marion; Hemson, Graham; Loveridge, Andrew J.; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Mills, Gus] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Endangered Wildlife Trust, ZA-1350 Skukuza, South Africa",,"Hemson, G (corresponding author), Queensland Pk & Wildlife Serv, 61 Yeppoon Rd, Parkhurst, Qld 4702, Australia.",graham.hemson@derm.qld.gov.au,"Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010","VALEIX, Marion/0000-0002-9732-1737",Rufford Foundation; Peoples Trust for Endangered Species; Wildlife Cafe; Born Free; Okavango Wildlife Society; K.

Interference interactions, harassment and injury from larger carnivores may still pose a risk to smaller mesopredators. Foraging theory suggests that animals should adjust their behaviour accordingly to optimise foraging efficiency and overall fitness, trading off harvest rate with costs to fitness. The foraging behaviour of red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, was studied with automated cameras and a repeated measures giving-up density (GUD) experiment where olfactory risk cues were manipulated. In Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia, red foxes increased GUDs by 34% and quitting harvest rates by 29% in response to wolf urine. In addition to leaving more food behind, foxes also responded to wolf urine by spending less time visiting food patches each day and altering their behaviour in order to compensate for the increased risk when foraging from patches. Thus, red foxes utilised olfaction to assess risk and experienced foraging costs due to the presence of a cue from gray wolves, Canis lupus. This study identifies behavioural mechanisms which may enable competing predators to coexist, and highlights the potential for additional ecosystem service pathways arising from the behaviour of large carnivores. Given the vulnerability of large carnivores to anthropogenic disturbance, a growing human population and intensifying resource consumption, it becomes increasingly important to understand ecological processes so that land can be managed appropriately.","[Haswell, Peter M.; Jones, Katherine A.; Hayward, Matt W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Haswell, Peter M.] UK Wolf Conservat Trust, Butlers Farm, Beenham RG7 5NT, Berks, England; [Kusak, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Vet, Dept Biol, Heinzelova 55, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Hayward, Matt W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hayward, Matt W.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Hayward, Matt W.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, Pretoria, South Africa",,"Haswell, PM (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.; Haswell, PM (corresponding author), UK Wolf Conservat Trust, Butlers Farm, Beenham RG7 5NT, Berks, England.",p.m.haswell@bangor.ac.uk,"Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010; Haswell, Peter/AAL-9477-2021","Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653; Haswell, Peter/0000-0002-3440-739X; Kusak, Josip/0000-0002-5544-6486; Jones, Katherine/0000-0001-7547-6781",Bangor University; The UK Wolf Conservation Trust; The Coalbourn Charitable Trust; Ann Vernon Memorial Travel Fund,"We would like to thank Bangor University, The UK Wolf Conservation Trust, The Coalbourn Charitable Trust, Ann Vernon Memorial Travel Fund and Sir Ian McKellen for funding the work.

In systems comprising multiple predators and prey species, a key challenge is distinguishing the independent effects of different predator guilds on prey responses. We exploited the acoustically distinct alarm calls of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarchus, to create a predator-specific landscape of fear from eagles to assess its impact on space use within mixed regressive-spatial regressive models incorporating data on resource distribution and structural characteristics of the environment. The landscape of fear from eagles was the most significant determinant of samango range use, with no effect of resource availability. The monkeys also selected areas of their range with higher canopies and higher understory visibility, behaviour consistent with further minimizing risk of predation. These results contrast with those of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, at the same site for which the landscapes of fear from leopards and baboons were the most significant determinants of space use. While highlighting that predation risk is a key driver of primate behaviour in this population, the landscapes of fear experienced by samango monkeys and vervet monkeys appear to differ despite exposure to identical predator guilds. This emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the risk effects of different predators in understanding prey ecology, but also that closely related prey species may respond to these predator-specific risks in different ways.

But fossorial species cannot stay safely underground forever, and they must also risk emerging overground, to forage and find mates. To make this trade-off effectively and maximize their own fitness, it is imperative they assess how predation risk varies in space and time, and adapt their denning behaviour accordingly. We used European badger (Meles meles) burrows (setts) in Bialowie(z) over dota Forest, Poland as a model for investigating how the denning behaviour of a fossorial mesocarnivore varies across gradients of landscape scale perceived risk imposed by wolves (Canis lupus) and humans, defined as wolf space use and distance to settlements, respectively. We monitored seventeen setts with varying levels of perceived human and wolf risk with camera traps for two months to study three denning behaviours: frequency of badger sett use, frequency of badger sett sharing with other mesocarnivore species and badger emergence time. Frequency of sett use varied relative to perceived wolf but not human risk. Setts in the highest risk areas were used ca. 60% less often than those in the lowest perceived risk areas, and setts with juveniles were only present in areas of lower perceived risk. Food availability, quantified as earthworm abundance in an area of 2.1 km(2)around setts, did not affect the frequency setts were used. Emergence time and frequency of sett sharing with other mesocarnivores, which have been proposed to be anti-predator strategies, did not vary with either perceived risk factor. These results show fossorial species can adapt their use of burrows to the prevailing risk landscape and suggest burrows deserve more attention in studies on the ecological impacts of apex predators.","[Diserens, T.

Here, in a novel approach, predator-specific landscapes of fear are constructed on the basis of behavioral responses of a prey species (vervet monkey; Cercopithecus aethiops), and we show how these can be combined with data on resource distribution to account for the observed variation in intensity of space use. Results from a mixed regressive-spatial regressive analysis demonstrate that ranging behavior can indeed be largely interpreted as an adaptive response to perceived risk of predation by some (but not all) predators and the spatial availability of resources.

Predator odor 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT) and its potent analog 2-methyl-2-thiazoline (2MT) are believed to activate specific odorant receptors to elicit innate fear/defensive behaviors in naive mice. Here, we conduct a large-scale recessive genetics screen of ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized mice. We find that loss of Trpal, a pungency/irritancy receptor, diminishes TMT/2MT and snake skin-evoked innate fear/defensive responses. Accordingly, Trpal(-/-) mice fail to effectively activate known fear/stress brain centers upon 2MT exposure, despite their apparent ability to smell and learn to fear 2MT. Moreover, Trpal acts as a chemosensor for 2MT/TMT and Trpal-expressing trigeminal ganglion neurons contribute critically to 2MT-evoked freezing. Our results indicate that Trpal-mediated nociception plays a crucial role in predator odor-evoked innate fear/defensive behaviors. The work establishes the first forward genetics screen to uncover the molecular mechanism of innate fear, a basic emotion and evolutionarily conserved survival mechanism.","[Wang, Yibing; Wu, Kejia; Liu, Qinghua] Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yibing; Wu, Kejia; Wang, Li; Zhou, Jiamin; Li, Yuwenbin; Liu, Qinghua] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Cao, Liqin; Lee, Chia-Ying; Asher, Greg; Saitoh, Tsuyoshi; Klewe-Nebenius, Daniela; Soya, Shingo; Hasegawa, Emi; Cherasse, Yoan; Miyoshi, Chika; Irukayama, Yoko; Wang, Zhiqiang; Sakurai, Katsuyasu; Funato, Hiromasa; Sakurai, Takeshi; Yanagisawa, Masashi; Nagase, Hiroshi; Liu, Qinghua] Univ Tsukuba, Int Inst Integrat Sleep Med WPI IIIS, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan; [Matsuo, Tomohiko; Tang, Lijun; Kobayakawa, Reiko; Kobayakawa, Ko] Kansai Med Univ, Funct Neurosci Lab, Hirakata, Osaka 5731010, Japan; [Russell, Jamie; Wang, Tao; Zhan, Xiaowei; Beutler, Bruce; Liu, Qinghua] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Genet Host Def, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Cao, Jie; Meeks, Julian P.; Liu, Qinghua] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Gautron, Laurent] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Funato, Hiromasa] Toho Univ, Dept Anat, Fac Med, Ota Ku, Tokyo 1438540, Japan; [Yanagisawa, Masashi] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba Adv Res Alliance, Life Sci Ctr, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan; [Liu, Qinghua] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Inst Multidisciplinary Biomed Res, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,"Liu, QH (corresponding author), Natl Inst Biol Sci, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Biochem, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Int Inst Integrat Sleep Med WPI IIIS, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan.; Kobayakawa, K (corresponding author), Kansai Med Univ, Funct Neurosci Lab, Hirakata, Osaka 5731010, Japan.; Beutler, B; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Ctr Genet Host Def, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.; Liu, QH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Inst Multidisciplinary Biomed Res, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",skobayak@me.com; bruce.beutler@utsouthwestern.edu; qinghua.liu@utsouthwestern.edu,"Meeks, Julian/ABE-4361-2020; Cherasse, Yoan/AAD-6442-2020; gautron, laurent/AAQ-5983-2021","Cherasse, Yoan/0000-0002-6139-8193; Wang, Li/0000-0001-8041-7188; Miyoshi, Chika/0000-0002-7109-1777; Kobayakawa, Ko/0000-0001-6406-5610; Zhou, Jiamin/0000-0002-9224-2060; Kobayakawa, Reiko/0000-0001-6613-5969; Soya, Shingo/0000-0001-7222-5012; Asher, Greg/0000-0001-8722-4151; Funato, Hiromasa/0000-0002-2787-9700","National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM111367, R37GM067759]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [I-1608]; UT Southwestern Medical Center (High Impact/High Risk grant); Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K14874, 17H06048, 26220207, 16H02591, 17K08133]; Japan Science and Technology Agency-step grant [AS271516U]; World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI) from MEXT, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","We thank Drs.

It reflects the level of risk tolerated by the animals. However, animals frequently approached by nonthreatening humans may progressively learn that there will be no adverse consequence for them, and thus perceive a reduced level of risk. I used an optimality model to study how this habituation process and risk allocation strategies could interact to determine FID. First, I computed the optimal FID for a foraging animal confronted with a single kind of threat. In this situation, the model predicts that FID should increase with the level of risk perceived during each encounter, and decrease when encounters become more frequent. Next, I used the model to explore what could happen after the arrival of nonthreatening humans in the environment, assuming that, initially, only predators were present. I studied how these environmental modifications could progressively affect the expectations of the forager, and its FIDs towards predators and humans. The model predicts that risk allocation strategies may either facilitate or impede habituation to nonlethal disturbance, with conflicting effects on the FIDs. Depending on the initial predation regime, the disturbance conditions created by humans and the number of predators that remain after human arrival, the animal may either progressively accept the presence of nonthreatening humans or retain a high level of sensitivity towards both predators and humans.

Yet neither the whole brain's response to innate acute fear nor how brain activity evolves over time is known. Sustained neuronal activity may be a factor in the development of a persistent fear response. We couple two experimental protocols to provoke acute fear leading to prolonged fear: Predator stress (PS), a naturalistic approach to induce fear in rodents; and Serotonin transporter knockout mouse (SERT-KO) that responds to PS with sustained defensive behavior. Behavior was monitored before, during and at short and long times after PS in wild type (WT) and SERT-KO mice. Both genotypes responded to PS with defensive behavior. SERT-KO retained defensive behavior for 23 days, while WT mice returned to baseline exploratory behavior by 9 days. Thus, differences in neural activity between WT and SERT-KO 9 days after PS identifies neural correlates of persistent defensive behavior, in mice. We used longitudinal manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to identify brain-wide neural activity associated with different behaviors. Mn2+ accumulation in active neurons occurs in awake, behaving mice and is retrospectively imaged. Following the same two cohorts of mice, WT and SERT-KO, longitudinally allowed unbiased quantitative comparisons of brain-wide activity by statistical parametric mapping (SPM). During natural behavior in WT, only low levels of activity-induced Mn2+-accumulation were detected, while much more accumulation appeared immediately after PS in both WT and SERT-KO, and evolved at 9 days to a new activity pattern (p < 0.0001, uncorr., T = 5.4). Patterns of accumulation differed between genotypes, with more regions of the brain and larger volumes within regions involved in SERT-KO than WT. A new computational segmentation analysis, using our InVivo Atlas based on a manganese-enhanced MR image of a living mouse, revealed dynamic changes in the volume of significantly enhanced voxels within each segment that differed between genotypes across 45 of 87 segmented regions. At Day 9 after PS, the striatum and ventral pallidum were active in both genotypes but more so in the SERT-KO. SERT-KO also displayed sustained or increased volume of Mn2+ accumulations between Post-Fear and Day 9 in eight segments where activity was decreased or silenced in WT. C-fos staining, an alternative neural activity marker, of brains from the same mice fixed at conclusion of imaging sessions confirmed that MEMRI detected active neurons. Intensity measurements in 12 regions of interest (ROIs) supported the SPM results. Between group comparisons by SPM and of ROI measurements identified specific regions differing between time points and genotypes. We report brain-wide activity in response to a single exposure of acute fear, and, for the first time, its evolution to new activity patterns over time in individuals vulnerable to persistent fear. Our results show multiple regions with dynamic changes in neural activity and that the balance of activity between segments is disordered in the SERT-KO. Thus, longitudinal MEMRI represents a powerful approach to discover how brain-wide activity evolves from the natural state either after an experience or during a disease process.","[Uselman, Taylor W.; Barto, Daniel R.; Bearer, Elaine L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Pathol, Hlth Sci Ctr, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Jacobs, Russell E.] Univ Southern Calif, Zilkha Neurogenet Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Jacobs, Russell E.; Bearer, Elaine L.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",,"Bearer, EL (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Pathol, Hlth Sci Ctr, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",ebearer@caltech.edu,,"Uselman, Taylor/0000-0002-3856-5248; Bearer, Elaine/0000-0002-8390-8529","NIH NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [RO1 MH096093, P50 GM085273]; Harvey Family Endowment; Postdoctoral Research Fund ASERT NIH NIGMS [5K12GM088021]; UNM Brain and Behavioral Health Institute Mini-Grant [BBHI 2019-20-005]","This research was supported in part by NIH NIMH RO1 MH096093 (EB), P50 GM085273 (EB) and the Harvey Family Endowment (EB).

This field-based study investigated how the behavioral response of coral reef fish families varied along a gradient of subsistence fishing pressure in Papua New Guinea. Specifically, we examined how fishing pressure was related to pre-flight behavior and flight initiation distance (FID), and whether FID was influenced by body size (centimeters total length), group size (including both con-and hetero-specific individuals), or life-history phase. Fishing pressure was positively associated with higher FID, but only in families that were primarily targeted by spear guns. Among these families, there were variable responses in FID; some families showed increased FID monotonically with fishing pressure, while others showed increased FID only at the highest levels of fishing pressure. Body size was more significant in varying FID at higher levels of fishing pressure. Although family-level differences in pre-flight behavior were reported, such behavior showed low concordance with fishing pressure. FID shows promise as a tool by which compliance and effectiveness of management of reef fisheries can be assessed.","[Januchowski-Hartley, Fraser A.; Graham, Nicholas A.

In forest birds, it has been proposed that landscape change can cause increased predation pressure that leads to population declines or community change. Predation can also have non-lethal effects on prey, such as creating 'landscapes of fear'. However, few studies have simultaneously investigated the relative contribution of regional land-use and local management to creating 'landscapes of fear'. Objectives To quantify the relative contribution of regional land-use and local management to the 'landscape of fear' in agricultural landscapes. Methods Bioacoustic recorders were used to quantify Eurasian Wren Troglodytes troglodytes alarm call rates in 32 naturally replicated broadleaf woodlands located in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Results Alarm call rates (the probability of an alarm per 10 min of audio) were positively correlated with the amount of agricultural land (arable or pasture) within 500 m of a woodland (effect size of 1) and were higher when livestock were present inside a woodland (effect size of 0.78). The amount of woodland and urban land cover in the landscape also had positive but weak effects on alarm call rates. Woodlands with gamebird management had fewer alarm calls (effect size of - 0.79). Conclusions We found that measures of both regional land-use and local management contributed to the 'landscape of fear' in agricultural landscapes. To reduce the impact of anthropogenic activities on 'fear' levels (an otherwise natural ecological process), land-managers should consider limiting livestock presence in woodlands and creating traditional 'buffer strips' (small areas of non-farmed land) at the interface between woodland edges and agricultural fields.","[Whytock, Robin C.; Fuentes-Montemayor, Elisa; Watts, Kevin; Call, Eilidh; Mann, Jennifer A.; Park, Kirsty J.] Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Watts, Kevin] Alice Holt Lodge, Forest Res, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England; [Macgregor, Nicholas A.] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England",,"Whytock, RC (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",rw52@stir.ac.uk,,"Fuentes-Montemayor, Elisa/0000-0002-5550-9432; Whytock, Robin/0000-0002-0127-6071",,,,52,2,2,3,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Risks of predation or interference competition are major factors shaping the distribution of species. An animal's response to risk can either be reactive, to an immediate risk, or predictive, based on preceding risk or past experiences. The manner in which animals respond to risk is key in understanding avoidance, and hence coexistence, between interacting species. 2. We investigated whether cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), known to be affected by predation and competition by lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta), respond reactively or predictively to the risks posed by these larger carnivores. 3. We used simultaneous spatial data from Global Positioning System (GPS) radiocollars deployed on all known social groups of cheetahs, lions and spotted hyaenas within a 2700 km(2) study area on the periphery of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. The response to risk of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas was explored on three levels: short-term or immediate risk, calculated as the distance to the nearest (contemporaneous) lion or spotted hyaena, long-term risk, calculated as the likelihood of encountering lions and spotted hyaenas based on their cumulative distributions over a 6-month period and habitat-associated risk, quantified by the habitat used by each of the three species. 4. We showed that space and habitat use by cheetahs was similar to that of lions and, to a lesser extent, spotted hyaenas. However, cheetahs avoided immediate risks by positioning themselves further from lions and spotted hyaenas than predicted by a random distribution. 5. Our results suggest that cheetah spatial distribution is a hierarchical process, first driven by resource acquisition and thereafter fine-tuned by predator avoidance; thus suggesting a reactive, rather than a predictive, response to risk.","[Broekhuis, Femke; Valeix, Marion; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney OX13 5QL, England; [Broekhuis, Femke; Cozzi, Gabriele; McNutt, John W.] Botswana Predator Conservat Trust, Maun, Botswana; [Cozzi, Gabriele] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Valeix, Marion] Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",,"Broekhuis, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney OX13 5QL, England.",femke.broekhuis@gmail.com,"Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010; Cozzi, Gabriele/ABI-8232-2020","Broekhuis, Femke/0000-0002-4216-8819; Cozzi, Gabriele/0000-0002-1744-1940",Tom Kaplan Prize Scholarship; Wilderness Wildlife Trust; Basel Zoo; Forschungskredit der Universitat Zurich; Vontobel Stiftung,"We thank the Botswana Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism for permission to conduct this research under permit number EWT 8/36/4 IV.

We assessed whether this pattern could be produced by not only habituation but also risk allocation by simulating attacks on blackbirds Turdus merula by both usual (pedestrians) and novel (radio-controlled vehicle) potential predators in parks with different levels of human visitation. Individual blackbirds from parks with higher pedestrian rates showed lower FID than individuals from parks with lower pedestrian rates, in response to both usual and novel approaches. Blackbirds adjusted their antipredator behavior to the specific level of pedestrian rate encountered every morning and evening in each park, with higher FID in the period with lower pedestrian rate. Similar responses to usual and novel potential predators among parks and daily variation in antipredator behavior support the risk allocation hypothesis and could not be explained by habituation. However, the rate at which FID was reduced in individuals from low-visited parks to high-visited parks was greater for pedestrian attacks than for novel potential predator attacks, suggesting that habituation is also present in our system and complements the effects of risk allocation. Our results have applied implications: the reduction in FID with increasing human visitation in natural areas is usually attributed to habituation; however, we propose that risk allocation can also reduce antipredator behavior effort to survive in habitats with high levels of recreational activities at the expense of potential physiological costs.","[Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Rodriguez-Prieto, Inaki; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Regis, Yohana] Fdn Nat & Hombre, El Astillero 39610, Spain",,"Fernandez-Juricic, E (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, MS 3702,1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",efernand@csulb.edu,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998",,,,37,77,79,1,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

For example, wildlife may be more vigilant near human disturbance, resulting in decreased forage intake and reduced reproductive success. We measured the effects of human activities compared to predator and other environmental factors on the behaviour of elk (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus 1758) in a human-dominated landscape in Alberta, Canada. Methodology/Principal Findings: We collected year-round behavioural data of elk across a range of human disturbances. We estimated linear mixed models of elk behaviour and found that human factors (land-use type, traffic and distance from roads) and elk herd size accounted for more than 80% of variability in elk vigilance. Elk decreased their feeding time when closer to roads, and road traffic volumes of at least 1 vehicle every 2 hours induced elk to switch into a more vigilant behavioural mode with a subsequent loss in feeding time. Other environmental factors, thought crucial in shaping vigilance behaviour in elk (natural predators, reproductive status of females), were not important. The highest levels of vigilance were recorded on public lands where hunting and motorized recreational activities were cumulative compared to the national park during summer, which had the lowest levels of vigilance. Conclusions/Significance: In a human-dominated landscape, effects of human disturbance on elk behaviour exceed those of habitat and natural predators. Humans trigger increased vigilance and decreased foraging in elk. However, it is not just the number of people but also the type of human activity that influences elk behaviour (e.g. hiking vs. hunting). Quantifying the actual fitness costs of human disturbance remains a challenge in field studies but should be a primary focus for future researches. Some species are much more likely to be disturbed by humans than by non-human predators: for these species, quantifying human disturbance may be the highest priority for conservation.","[Ciuti, Simone; Simi, Silvia; Pitt, Justin A.; Boyce, Mark S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Northrup, Joseph M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Muhly, Tyler B.] Alberta Innovates, Technol Futures, Vegreville, AB, Canada; [Musiani, Marco] Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",,"Ciuti, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",ciuti@ualberta.ca,"Northrup, Joseph/AAM-2874-2020; Boyce, Mark S/A-2620-2014; Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013; Northrup, Joseph/G-5427-2012; Moreira, Nei/AAK-1357-2020; Musiani, Marco/ABB-9387-2021","Northrup, Joseph/0000-0001-6319-4138; Boyce, Mark S/0000-0001-5811-325X; Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509; Northrup, Joseph/0000-0001-6319-4138; Moreira, Nei/0000-0002-9236-667X; Musiani, Marco/0000-0002-6097-5841",Alberta Conservation Association (ACA - Grant Eligible Conservation Fund); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC-CRD)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Shell Canada limited,"Alberta Conservation Association (ACA - Grant Eligible Conservation Fund), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC-CRD), and Shell Canada limited.

We aimed to determine whether forage selection by European bison Bison bonasus was state-dependent in being shaped by risk (wolf predation or human poaching/culling avoidance) or nutrient quality at two time periods-early winter (when resources are abundant) and at the end of winter (when resources are scarce)-in BiaowieA1/4a Primeval Forest (Poland). We used a giving-up density framework using the proportional consumption of hay provided by humans to measure the perceptions of risk in European bison. European bison resource selection was primarily driven by minimising the distance they travel over open ground in early winter (i.e. avoiding humans), however by the end of winter, when resources are scarce, bison selected haystacks for their nutrient quality (low fibre, high Mg and energy). This study illustrates how resource selection varies according to the condition of animals (i.e. state-dependency affects the marginal value theorem). It also indicates conservation managers using hay quality may actively manage human-bison conflicts in trouble spots and that bison are currently free from top-down limitation in BiaowieA1/4a as they do not perceive wolves as threatening enough to alter their foraging behaviour.","[Hayward, Matt W.] Bangor Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hayward, Matt W.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Hayward, Matt W.; Kowalczyk, Rafa] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Bialowieza, Poland; [Ortmann, Sylvia] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, D-10315 Berlin, Germany",,"Hayward, MW (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Bialowieza, Poland.",hayers111@gmail.com; ortmann@izw-berlin.de; rkowal@ibs.bialowieza.pl,"Ortmann, Sylvia/B-7088-2015; Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010","Ortmann, Sylvia/0000-0003-2520-6251; Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653; Kowalczyk, Rafal/0000-0001-7264-2158","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [2P04F 011 26, N N304 253435]; Mammal Research Institute budget; BIORESC (Marie Curie Transfer of Knowledge Program of the European Union) [MTKD-CT-2005-029957]","We thank Graham Kerley and Adrian Shrader for assistance in addressing the referees concerns about our use of a giving-up density framework, and thank the four referees for their efforts.

Because an animal rarely encounters threatening stimuli in isolation, multiple disturbances can act in non-independent ways to shape an animal's landscape of fear, making it challenging to isolate their effects for effective and targeted management. We present extensions to an existing behavioral agent-based model (ABM) to use as an inverse modeling approach to test, in a scenario-sensitivity analysis, whether threatened Alberta boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) differentially respond to industrial features (linear features, forest cutblocks, wellsites) and their attributes: presence, density, harvest age, and wellsite activity status. The spatially explicit ABM encapsulates predation risk, heterogeneous resource distribution, and species-specific energetic requirements, and successfully recreates the general behavioral mechanisms driving habitat selection. To create various industry-driven, predation-risk landscape scenarios for the sensitivity analysis, we allowed caribou agents to differentially perceive and respond to industrial features and their attributes. To identify which industry had the greatest relative influence on caribou habitat use and spatial distribution, simulated caribou movement patterns from each of the scenarios were compared with those of actual caribou from the study area, using a pattern-oriented, multi-response optimization approach. Results revealed caribou have incorporated forestry- and oil and gas features into their landscape of fear that distinctly affect their spatial and energetic responses. The presence of roads, pipelines and seismic lines, and, to a minor extent, high-density cutblocks and active wellsites, all contributed to explaining caribou behavioral responses. Our findings also indicated that both industries produced interaction effects, jointly impacting caribou spatial and energetic patterns, as no one feature could adequately explain anti-predator movement responses. We demonstrate that behavior-based ABMs can be applied to understanding, assessing, and isolating non-consumptive anthropogenic impacts, in support of wildlife management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the behavior of Kloss gibbons that may be attributed to avoiding human predation. We observed Kloss gibbons in the Peleonan forest in the north of Siberut Island, the northernmost of the Mentawai island chain, over 18 months in 2007 and 2008, and collected data on their singing behavior, the number of individuals present during different conditions and their responses to humans. We examine behaviors that may reduce the risk of predation by humans during singing (the most conspicuous gibbon behavior), daily non-singing activities and encounters with humans. The individual risk of being stalked by hunters is reduced by singing in same-sex choruses and the risk of successful capture by hunters during singing is reduced by singing less often during daylight hours and by leaving the location of male pre-dawn singing before full light (reducing the visual signal to hunters). Groups in the Peleonan also fission during non-singing daily activity and rarely engage in play or grooming, enhancing the crypticity of their monochromatic black pelage in the canopy. We also observed a coordinated response to the presence of humans, wherein one adult individual acted as a decoy by approaching and distracting human observers, while other group members fled silently in multiple directions. Decoy behavior occurred on 31% of 96 encounters with unhabituated Kloss gibbons that detected our presence. Decoy individuals may put themselves at risk to increase the survival of related immatures (and adult females with infants) who have a greater risk of predation. We argue that, in combination, these behaviors are an evolved response to a long history of predation by humans. Am. J. Primatol. 77:296-308, 2015.

However, it is not clear whether adult large carnivores that are virtually free of natural predation adjust their behavior to subtle variations in human-derived risk, even when living in human-dominated landscapes. As a model, we studied resting-site selection by a large carnivore, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), under different spatial and temporal levels of human activity. We quantified horizontal and canopy cover at 440 bear beds and 439 random sites at different distances from human settlements, seasons, and times of the day. We hypothesized that beds would be more concealed than random sites and that beds would be more concealed in relation to human-derived risk. Although human densities in Scandinavia are the lowest within bear ranges in Western Europe, we found an effect of human activity; bears chose beds with higher horizontal and canopy cover during the day (0700-1900 hours), especially when resting closer to human settlements, than at night (2200-0600 hours). In summer/fall (the berry season), with more intensive and dispersed human activity, including hunting, bears rested further from human settlements during the day than in spring (pre-berry season). Additionally, day beds in the summer/fall were the most concealed. Large carnivores often avoid humans at a landscape scale, but total avoidance in human-dominated areas is not possible. Apparently, bears adjust their behavior to avoid human encounters, which resembles the way prey avoid their predators. Bears responded to fine-scale variations in human-derived risk, both on a seasonal and a daily basis.","[Ordiz, Andres; Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway; [Ordiz, Andres; Delibes, Miguel] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Seville 41092, Spain; [Stoen, Ole-Gunnar] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Ecol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway",,"Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, Postbox 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com,"Swenson, Jon/E-2883-2013; Delibes, Miguel/K-2744-2014; Støen, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020; Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019","Delibes, Miguel/0000-0002-3569-567X; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; WWF Sweden; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; program Adaptive management of fish and wildlife populations; Fundacion Oso de Asturias; Hunosa; Sato,"We appreciate the help provided in the Weld by volunteers and students of the Scandinavian Brown Bear Research Project, which is funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management, Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, WWF Sweden, Research Council of Norway, and the program Adaptive management of fish and wildlife populations.

While our basic knowledge of social systems has grown substantially, it has rarely been applied to human issues. Here, we attempted to bridge the gap between animal behaviour theory and human psychology by conducting social experiments involving fish. As in many species, minnows (family: Cyprinidae) repeatedly exposed to risky situations can develop a behavioural phenotype characterized by neophobic tendencies, pacing and stereotypic behaviours. Here, we tested whether the simple presence of calm (or un-calm) conspecific models could lead to a weakening of the high-risk phenotype in minnows that acquired fear either in isolation or within a group. We first documented that the social context of risk exposure impacted the intensity of the high-risk phenotype, with minnows exposed to risk in isolation showing stronger high-risk traits compared to those that were exposed to risk in groups. However, individuals exposed to risk in isolation were more influenced by calm models, despite their more pronounced phenotype. We argue that group exposure led to social reinforcement of risk, which in turn decreased the information transfer about safety in these individuals. We also demonstrate that a group of calm models, and not un-calm models, was required to weaken the high-risk phenotype. These findings highlight the interplay between social reinforcement of risk and safety in social groups and the impact of groups on information transmission. Moreover, our results parallel anecdotal reports of successes or failures of social therapies for post-traumatic stress (PTS) patients based on the social context of symptom acquisition, suggesting that understanding the transfer of information in social animals could prove fruitful in understanding and modelling PTS recovery.

In this study, we hypothesized that intensive hunting and enduring fear of humans have caused moose and other forest ungulates to partly avoid areas near human infrastructure (perceived hunting risk), with positive cascading effects on recruitment of trees. Using data from the Norwegian forest inventory, we found decreasing browsing pressure and increasing tree recruitment in areas close to roads and houses, where ungulates are more likely to encounter humans. However, although browsing and recruitment were negatively related, reduced browsing was only responsible for a small proportion of the higher tree recruitment near human infrastructure. We suggest that the apparently weak cascading effect occurs because the recorded browsing pressure only partly reflects the long-term browsing intensity close to humans. Accordingly, tree recruitment was also related to the density of small trees 5-10 years earlier, which was higher close to human infrastructure. Hence, if small tree density is a product of the browsing pressure in the past, the cascading effect is probably stronger than our estimates suggest. Reduced browsing near roads and houses is most in line with risk avoidance driven by fear of humans (behaviorally mediated), and not because of excessive hunting and local reduction in ungulate density (density mediated).","[Mehlhoop, Anne C.; Van Moorter, Bram; Rolandsen, Christer M.; Hagen, Dagmar; Solberg, Erling J.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway; [Mehlhoop, Anne C.; Ringsby, Thor Harald] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway; [Granhus, Aksel; Eriksen, Rune] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, As, Norway",,"Mehlhoop, AC (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Trondheim, Norway.",anne.mehlhoop@nina.no,,"Rolandsen, Christer Moe/0000-0002-5628-0385",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [272413],This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (272413).,,62,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Additionally, recent studies in mouse models of immune deficiency have suggested that adaptive immunity may play a role during traumatic stress exposure and that impairments in lymphocyte function may contribute to increased susceptibility to various psychogenic stressors. However, rodent studies on the relationship between maladaptive stress responses and lymphocyte deficiency have been complicated by the fact that genetic manipulations in these models may also result in changes in CNS function due to the expression of targeted genes in tissues other than lymphocytes, including the brain. To address these issues we utilized mice with a deletion of recombination-activating gene 2 (Rag2), which has no confirmed expression in the CNS; thus, its loss should result in the absence of mature lymphocytes without altering CNS function directly. Stress responsiveness of immune deficient Rag2(-/-) mice on a BALB/c background was evaluated in three different paradigms: predator odor exposure (POE), fear conditioning (FC) and learned helplessness (LH). These models are often used to study different aspects of stress responsiveness after the exposure to an acute stressor. In addition, immunoblot analysis was used to assess hippocampal BDNF expression under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. Subsequent to POE, Rag2(-/-) mice exhibited a reduced acoustic startle response compared to BALB/c mice; no significant differences in behavior were observed in either FC or LH. Furthermore, analysis of hippocampal BDNF indicated that Rag2(-/-) mice have elevated levels of the mature form of BDNF compared to BALB/c mice. Results from our studies suggest that the absence of mature lymphocytes is associated with increased resilience to stress exposure in the POE and does not affect behavioral responses in the FC and LH paradigms. These findings indicate that lymphocytes play a specific role in stress responsiveness dependent upon the type, nature and intensity of the stressor.

Disturbances cause an animal to flee from the perceived predation risk, using energy, rather than remaining and gaining energy. Such reactions are, however, context-dependent, as predicted by optimal escape theory: animals should only flee when the perceived risk of predation of remaining exceeds the risk of starvation of leaving. Animals may also learn that humans do not generally represent a predation risk after repeated false alarms and then learn to only respond when approached deliberately and closely. We tested the Flight Initiation Distance (FID; distance at which an approached animal begins escape) of feeding or roosting Eurasian Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus (oystercatchers) to a human (as a simulated predator) in areas with or without humans on beaches in south-east Scotland. We predicted roosting oystercatchers to respond earlier (greater FID) than feeding birds because the risk of starvation will be lower, and earlier on beaches where there were no humans at the start of the experiment because a human will then represent a more novel predator signal. As predicted, oystercatchers escaped at greater distances away from the perceived threat when feeding and in areas with humans. We found that escape distances decreased (greater tolerance of the perceived threat) as the number of people in an area increased, but people being present or not explained more of the variation in the data. The results show that oystercatchers habituate on a short timescale to non-lethal human presence and generally respond to perceived predation risk in accordance with the predictions of optimal escape theory.","[Azaki, Bukola D.

Hyraxes migrate from refuge to refuge, presumably following forage availability, but their migration patterns are strongly affected by the availability and spacing of the rock piles that form their den sites and give them protection from predators. We therefore expect changes in predation risk to influence the ability of hyrax groups to migrate from site to site. We combine mathematical metapopulation models of hyrax behavioral ecology, as well as compartmental models of disease dynamics, to investigate the effect of microhabitat alteration and varying perceived predation risk on disease incidence. Our models indicate that such fine-scale alterations in predation risk can have surprising effects on pathogen prevalence, leading to the emergence of epizootic cycles. Regular (predictable) cycles and chaotic (unpredictable) cycles may occur as predation risk is reduced. Under some conditions, cycles may result from very small changes in predation risk or environmental conditions. Our models show regions of sensitive dependence on environmental and predatory conditions, leading us to predict the possibility of the emergence of chaotic disease cycles as the result of small environmental disturbances.","[Kershenbaum, Arik; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Kershenbaum, Arik; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel; [Stone, Lewi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel",,"Kershenbaum, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",arik.kershenbaum@gmail.com,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Kershenbaum, Arik/C-3552-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Kershenbaum, Arik/0000-0003-0464-0243; Stone, Lewi/0000-0002-6465-579X",University of Haifa,We thank David (Tap) Meir and Roni King of the Israel National Parks Authority for their assistance in the study of hyraxes in the wild; Eli Geffen and Amiyaal Ilany for their advice on hyrax behavior and ecology; and the University of Haifa for a research fellowship awarded to Arik Kershenbaum.

We performed an extensive analysis of predatory behavior across the lunar cycle on the largest dataset of lion attacks ever assembled and found that African lions are as sensitive to moonlight when hunting humans as when hunting herbivores and that lions are most dangerous to humans when the moon is faint or below the horizon. At night, people are most active between dusk and 10: 00 pm, thus most lion attacks occur in the first weeks following the full moon (when the moon rises at least an hour after sunset). Consequently, the full moon is a reliable indicator of impending danger, perhaps helping to explain why the full moon has been the subject of so many myths and misconceptions.","[Packer, Craig; Swanson, Alexandra; Kushnir, Hadas] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Ikanda, Dennis] Tanzanian Wildlife Res Inst, Arusha, Tanzania",,"Packer, C (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",packer@umn.edu,"Callahan, Charles D/L-1641-2013",,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0343960, 0918142]; Biocomplexity grant [BE-0308486]; Wildlife Conservation Society; Tanzanian Wildlife Protection Fund; Panthera; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1020479] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Research in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro was funded by NSF LTREB grants DEB-0343960 and 0918142 and Biocomplexity grant BE-0308486.

The clinical use of the labels is ambiguous, often defining one in terms of the other. We first consider what a useful, objective, and scientifically valid definition would entail and then evaluate several fear/anxiety distinctions that have been made in the neurobiological literature. A strong distinction should specify the difference in conditions that lead to fear versus anxiety. Additionally, fear and anxiety should generate distinct sets of behaviors. Ideally, the two states should be supported by distinguishable neuroan-atomical circuits. Such a conceptualization would be consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoc). The majority of neurobiological approaches to the fear versus anxiety distinction fail to differentiate the two states in terms of behavior, often using the exact same behavioral measures as indicators. Of the two that do, only Predatory Imminence Theory provides a distinction both in terms of cause and effect. Indeed, that approach provides a ready distinction of anxiety, fear, and panic in terms of both antecedent conditions and response selection rules. Additionally, it appeals to distinct neural circuits to generate these modes of action.","[Perusini, Jennifer N.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Perusini, Jennifer N.] Res Fdn Mental Hyg Inc RFMH, NYSPI, Div Integrat Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Fanselow, MS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",fanselow@psych.ucla.edu,,, [RO1 MH62122]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062122] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,M.S.F. was supported by RO1 MH62122.,,96,155,155,1,37,"COLD SPRING HARBOR LAB PRESS, PUBLICATIONS DEPT",COLD SPRING HARBOR,"1 BUNGTOWN RD, COLD SPRING HARBOR, NY 11724 USA",1072-0502,1549-5485,,LEARN MEMORY,Learn.

In habitats where vision and olfaction serve as the primary sources of information, reduced visual input from suspended sediment may lead to significant alterations in prey fish behaviour. Here, we test whether prey compensate for reduced visual information by increasing their antipredator responses to chemically mediated risk cues in turbid conditions. Experiments with the spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, found that baseline activity levels were reduced by 23 per cent in high turbidity conditions relative to low turbidity conditions. Furthermore, risk cues elicited strong antipredator responses at all turbidity levels; the strongest antipredator responses were observed in high turbidity conditions, with fish reducing their foraging by almost 40 per cent, as compared with 17 per cent for fish in clear conditions. This provides unambiguous evidence of sensory compensation in a predation context for a tropical marine fish, and suggests that prey fish may be able to behaviourally offset some of the fitness reductions resulting from anthropogenic sedimentation of their habitats.","[Leahy, Susannah M.; McCormick, Mark I.; Mitchell, Matthew D.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Leahy, Susannah M.; McCormick, Mark I.; Mitchell, Matthew D.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Ferrari, Maud C.

We examined the spatial and ecological characteristics of predator encounters, as well as behavioral responses to perceived predation risk, in 5 groups of wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in Costa Rica over a 1.5-year period. Alarm-calling bouts directed at birds were more likely to originate in high forest strata, whereas alarm-calling bouts at snakes and terrestrial quadrupeds were more likely to originate near the ground. Relative risk maps based on the locations of predator encounters revealed that high-risk areas for birds and for all guilds combined consisted of more mature forest, whereas low-risk areas for these predators consisted of relatively younger forest. The animals were most vigilant near the ground, which may reflect greater perceived exposure to snakes and terrestrial predators in lower vertical levels. Incorporating the combined risk function into a predictive model of vigilance behavior improved prediction relative to null models of uniform risk or habitat-specific risk. Our results suggest that capuchin monkeys in this study system perceive reduced predation risk in the high and middle forest layers, and they adjust their vigilance behavior to small-scale spatial variation in perceived risk.","[Campos, Fernando A.; Fedigan, Linda M.] Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Campos, Fernando A.] Univ Tokyo, Dept Integrated Biosci, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",,"Campos, FA (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB, Canada.",facampos@ucalgary.ca,"Campos, Fernando A./I-2525-2019","Campos, Fernando A./0000-0001-9826-751X",Leakey Foundation; Alberta Innovates/Technology Futures; American Society of Primatologists; University of Calgary; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"This research was funded by grants from the Leakey Foundation, Alberta Innovates/Technology Futures, the American Society of Primatologists, and the University of Calgary (to F.

Because anxiety and fear are mechanisms evolved to manage threats from predators and other exigencies, the large behavioral, ecological and evolutionary literature on predation risk is useful for re-framing experimental research on human anxiety-related disorders. We review the trade-offs that are commonly made during antipredator decision-making in wild animals along with the context under which the behavior is performed and measured, and highlight their relevance for focused laboratory models of fear and anxiety. We then develop an integrative mechanistic model of decision-making under risk which, when applied to laboratory and field settings, should improve studies of the biological basis of normal and pathological anxiety and may therefore improve translational outcomes.","[Fendt, Markus; Kreutzmann, Judith C.] Otto von Guericke Univ, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, Leipziger Str 44, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Fendt, Markus] Otto von Guericke Univ, Ctr Behav Brain Sci CBBS, Magdeburg, Germany; [Parsons, Michael H.] Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Apfelbach, Raimund] Univ Tubingen, Zool Inst, Neurobiol, Tubingen, Germany; [Carthey, Alexandra J.

When marmosets were isolated in an unfamiliar environment, they frequently vocalized tsik-egg calls, which were the combination calls of 'tsik' followed by several 'egg'. Tsik-egg calls were also observed after treatment with the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 (20 mg/kg, Sc). In contrast, when marmosets were exposed to predatory stimuli as fear-evoking situations, they frequently vocalized tsik solo calls as well as tsik-egg calls. These results suggest that marmosets dissociate the vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik calls under conditions related to fear/anxiety; tsik-egg solo vocalizations were emitted under anxiety-related conditions (e.g., isolation and anxiogenic drug treatment), whereas a mixed vocalization of tsik-egg and tsik was emitted when confronted with fear-provoking stimuli (i.e., threatening predatory stimuli). Tsik-egg call with/without tsik can be used as a specific vocal index of fear/anxiety in marmosets, which allows us to understand the neural mechanism of negative emotions in primate.

Studies undertaken across the current wolf (Canis lupus) range suggested a number of variables that may be correlated with activity patterns of wolves. These factors vary locally and there has been no attempt so far at defining those that ubiquitously impact wolf behaviour. I compared 11 studies (from Alaska to Israel) to assess the influence of (1) public road density, (2) human population density, (3) human-caused mortality, (4) proportion of domestic animals in wolf diet, (5) proportion of forest, (6) latitude and (7) mean annual temperature on nocturnal wolf activity and movements. Nocturnal activity was mainly correlated to the proportion of domestic animals in the diet and the density of public roads, whereas nocturnal movements were mainly correlated to latitude. The importance of latitude indicates that sun periodicity might represent an important signal (`Zeitgeber') for circadian rhythms in wolves. Environmental constraints such as high temperatures during the day and a higher hunting success in crepuscular periods probably limit the ability of wolves to avoid humans by nocturnal behaviour. I therefore suggest that in regions where wolves hunt wild prey, they experience a trade-off between predation risk by humans and increased hunting success during twilight hours.","[Theuerkauf, Joern] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Warsaw, Poland",,"Theuerkauf, J (corresponding author), 45 Rue Maurice Herzog, Noumea 98800, New Caledonia.",jtheuer@miiz.waw.pl,"Theuerkauf, Jörn/B-6823-2009","Theuerkauf, Jörn/0000-0002-7273-3073",,,,62,39,39,4,114,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JUL,2009,115,7,,,,,649,657,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01653.x,,,9,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,453TZ,WOS:000266637100005,,,,,2022-04-19,

The authors used an arena test to assess whether human staring altered the behavior of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) compared with no human eye contact. Sheep glanced at the staring human's face more often in the first 2 min of the test, indicating that they perceived a difference between the human stimuli. Staring also elicited more locomotor activity and urination than averted gaze. However, there were no differences in fear-related behaviors, suggesting that a staring human did not represent a greater immediate threat than a nonwatching human. These results imply that human staring is a warning cue for domestic sheep, but no more. Without further reinforcement, sheep quickly habituated to the warning cue.","Massey Univ, Palmerston North, New Zealand",,"Stafford, KJ (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",k.j.stafford@massey.ac.nz,,,,,,56,15,15,0,18,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC/EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7036,,,J COMP PSYCHOL,J.

These relationships are exemplified by white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in mixed hardwood forest communities of the northeastern U.S.A., whose foraging behaviour can influence the population ecology of several prey items and the disease ecology of human Lyme disease and its tick vector. We examined whether dosage of an immunogen influenced foraging behaviour in wild white-footed mice at foraging arenas. Low-dose mice preferentially favoured safe (covered) food patches over risky food patches, whereas high-dose mice showed no preference based on patch safety. Immunochallenge did not alter foraging time in patches of equal risk. The results reveal fitness costs of an immune response, namely that immunochallenged mice favour increased energy consumption over safety from predation, presumably leading to greater mortality. Acceptance of risky patches for foraging by immunochallenged mice suggests that mice mounting this immune response will forage in a greater proportion of their home ranges and encounter a greater number of patchily distributed prey items and ticks carrying pathogens.

This conflict has prompted the development of non-lethal deterrents, a management technique that uses aversive stimuli to elicit avoidance. Animals are expected to be sensitive to cues of danger to avoid sources of mortality. Deterrents capitalize on behavioral mechanisms such as threat detection, assessment and learning. A deterrent must create enough risk, or cost, that it overcomes the heightened foraging benefits of depredation. Theoretically, effective deterrence relies on altering the relative costs and benefits to the individual depredator by creating a perceived risk associated with human resources. Here we discuss the underlying behavioral basis of how deterrents generate avoidance. We review deterrents applied to marine mammals to mitigate conflict with fisheries and suggest that fear conditioning could be useful in this context. This is discussed in the context of some potential management concerns of application of non-lethal deterrents in the wild. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Animals can increase risk avoidance in response to fluctuations in predation risk, but questions remain regarding individual variability and the capacity to respond to changes in spatial risk across human-altered landscapes. In northeast British Columbia, Canada, boreal caribou populations declined as roads and seismic lines have increased, which are theorized to increase gray wolf predation. Our goal was to model risk and to evaluate individual variability and the development of risk perception by examining individual risk avoidance in response to reproductive status and age. We used locations from collared caribou and wolves to identify landscape features associated with the risk of a potential wolf-caribou encounter and risk of being killed given an encounter. We built resource selection functions to estimate individual responses to risk. We used general linear regressions to evaluate individual risk and linear feature avoidance as a function of age and reproductive status (calf or no calf). Linear features increased the risk of encounter. Older caribou and caribou with calves demonstrated stronger avoidance of the risk of encounter and roads, but weaker avoidance in late summer to the risk of being killed relative to younger and calf-less individuals. Mechanisms explaining the inverse relationships between the risk of encounter and risk of being killed are uncertain, but it is conceivable that caribou learn to avoid the risk of encounter and roads. Responses by females with vulnerable calves to the risk of encounter and risk of being killed might be explained by a trade-off between these two risk types and a prioritization on the risk of encounter. Despite the capacity to alter their responses to risk, the global decline in Rangifer populations (caribou and wild reindeer) suggests these behaviors are insufficient to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances.","[Mumma, Matthew A.; Gillingham, Michael P.; Johnson, Chris J.; Parker, Katherine L.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management, Prince George, BC, Canada",,"Mumma, MA (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management, Prince George, BC, Canada.",matt.mumma@unbc.ca,,"Mumma, Matthew/0000-0003-1954-6524",British Columbia Oil and Gas Research and Innovation Society,British Columbia Oil and Gas Research and Innovation Society,,70,29,30,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Furthermore, few studies examined multiscale predation risk avoidance by migrant ungulates, yet recent research reveals that predator-prey interactions occur at multiple scales. We test the predation risk reduction hypothesis at two spatial scales in a partially migratory elk (Cervus elaphus) population by comparing exposure of migrant and resident elk to wolf (Canis lupus) predation risk. We used GPS and VHF telemetry data collected from 67 migrant and 44 resident elk over the summers of 2002-2004 in and adjacent to Banff National Park (BNP), Canada. We used wolf GPS and VHF telemetry data to estimate predation risk as a function of the relative probability of wolf occurrence weighted by a spatial density model that adjusted for varying pack sizes. We validated the predation risk model using independent data on wolf-killed elk, and showed that combining wolf presence and spatial density best predicted where an elk was likely to be killed. Predation risk on summer ranges of migrant elk was reduced by 70% compared to within resident elk summer ranges. Because wolves avoided areas near high human activity, however, fine-scale selection by resident elk for areas near high human activity reduced their predation risk exposure to only 15% higher than migrants, a difference significant in only one of three summers. Finally, during actual migration, elk were exposed to 1.7 times more predation risk than residents, even though migration was rapid. Our results support the hypothesis that large-scale migrations can reduce predation. However, we also show that where small-scale spatial variation in predation risk exists, nonmigratory elk may equally reduce predation risk as effectively as migrants under some circumstances.","Univ Montana, Coll Forestry, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada",,"Hebblewhite, M (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Coll Forestry, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",mark.hebblewhite@cfc.umt.edu,"Merrill, Evelyn/A-2668-2014; hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013; Hebblewhite, Mark/AAI-8101-2020; Merrill, Evelyn/N-5801-2015","Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361; Merrill, Evelyn/0000-0001-7737-958X",,,,53,158,161,3,112,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2007,152,2,,,,,377,387,,10.1007/s00442-007-0661-y,,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,165AM,WOS:000246276200019,17287955,,,,2022-04-19,

The presence of these large- bodied snakes in the continental United States has attracted intense media attention, including regular reference to the possibility of these snakes preying on humans. Over the course of a decade ( 2003- 2012), we solicited reports of apparently unprovoked strikes directed at humans in Everglades NP. We summarize the circumstances surrounding each of the 5 reported incidents, which occurred between 2006 and 2012. All strikes were directed toward biologists moving through flooded wetlands; 2 strikes resulted in minor injury and none resulted in constriction. We consider most of these strikes to be cases of mistaken identity, in which the python initiated a strike at a potential prey item but aborted its predatory behavior prior to constriction and ingestion. No strikes are known to have been directed at park visitors despite visitation rates averaging over one million per year during this period. We conclude that while risks to humans should not be completely discounted, the relative risk of a human being killed by a python in Everglades NP appears to be extremely low. Published 2014.

Prey animals are thus expected to assess the costs and benefits of expressing antipredator behavior in different circumstances and to respond optimally according to the perceived risk of predation. One prediction of this hypothesis is that the response to nonlethal disturbance should be elevated when the risk of predation is high, although few studies have tested this prediction with respect to the distribution of actual predators in nature. We used landscape-level variation in the distribution of large mammalian predators (feral cats) to investigate antipredator behavior in a small breeding shorebird, the Two-banded Plover Charadrius falklandicus. We used 8 sites in the Falkland Islands and Argentina and measured the flushing distances of incubating Two-banded Plovers in response to a controlled human approach to the nest. We found that flushing distances were increased at sites where mammalian predators were present and decreased where exposure to humans was high. These effects were additive, and we interpret them as the effects of generalization and habituation, respectively.","[St Clair, James J.

A total of 117 birds (66 pure and 51 hybrid partridges; 74 females and 43 males) maintained in outdoor cages were used at a range of 52 to 55 wk of age. Four active fear tests were performed (novel object test, fear of humans test, emergence test, and restraint test) in order to analyze differences between pure and hybrid populations regarding the escape response type (novel object test and fear of humans test), the withdrawal distance (fear of humans test), and the reaction time (emergence test and restraint test). These variables could determine the ability of pure partridges captive to survive when released into the wild for hunting. There were no significant differences in anti-predator behavior in pure and hybrid birds, only one trend was observed in withdrawal distance (P = 0.09), being greater in pure than in hybrids partridges. There was a significant difference between sexes in the response type in the novel object test (P = 0.05); whereby the females came closer to the object than the males. The results of the present study indicate that active anti-predatory behavior was not associated with the genotype. However, since captivity could reduce the active anti-predator behavior, the results could be different if the wild birds that were tested had been sourced from their natural environment. Both sexes had similar active anti-predator behavior, although the males showing less approach behavior to a novel object that could be related to the sex-dimorphic behavior in natural social structure.","[Davila, S.

The results are crucial for reducing human-nature conflicts and for education. Thanks to this study, we conclude that humans are responsible for reducing the risk of direct contact between these two canine species. The risk of interaction between wolves and a dog that is with a human depends on the distance between the dog and its owner, the number of wolves, and the size of the dog. Hunting with a dog poses a seven times greater risk of interaction with wolves compared to recreational walking. As a result of species protection in Poland, wolves now appear in places that are attractive for human recreation, increasing their exposure to dogs. This creates a risk of spontaneous direct interactions between these two canine species. Aggressive interactions between the gray wolf and the domestic dog lead to human-large predator conflicts. This study examined wolf-dog interactions using data collected in an online questionnaire and included questions related to factors that might influence the likelihood of interactions between these canines. One of the most important factors affecting the likelihood of interaction between a dog and a wolf was the distance between the dog and the human. The number of wolves was also important-the more wolves, the more likely they were to interact with dogs. The risk of interaction also significantly increases with decreasing distance to human settlements. There were also statistical differences in terms of the type of outdoor activity being engaged in. Hunting was seven times more likely to result in a wolf-dog interaction than normal walk. We postulate that the choices made by the human (dog control and type of recreation) caring for the dog are an important factor that can reduce the risk of direct contact between dogs and wolves.","[Haidt, Andzelika; Gawrys, Radoslaw] Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Ecol, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Raszyn, Poland; [Szewczyk, Maciej] Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, Dept Vertebrate Ecol & Zool, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland",,"Haidt, A (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Ecol, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Raszyn, Poland.",a.haidt@ibles.waw.pl; r.gawrys@ibles.waw.pl; maciej.szewczyk@ug.edu.pl,"Szewczyk, Maciej/AAH-1959-2021; Haidt, Andzelika/R-9055-2018","Szewczyk, Maciej/0000-0001-7424-1120; Haidt, Andzelika/0000-0002-3570-8899","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland; Forest Research Institute [900101]",The study was financed by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education with funds from the Forest Research Institute within the framework of the research project entitled Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) Interactions with Domestic Dogs (Canis familiaris)-Competition or Hybridization?

For a young mammal, the mother is one of the most salient aspects of its environment, and she can have a strong influence on her offspring's behaviour. This study investigated whether fearfulness in foals can be reduced through weekly exposure to usually frightening objects with a habituated mother during the first 8 weeks of life. Prior to foaling, mares (N = 22) were habituated to five initially fear-eliciting situations, including exposure to novel stationary and moving objects. At birth, the foals were randomly assigned to either a Demonstration group (N = 11) or a Control group (N = 11). Demonstration mares demonstrated habituation towards the objects to their foals once per week in weeks 1-8 post-partum. Control mares were inside the empty test arena with their foals for the same amount of time. The foals were tested at 8 weeks and 5 months of age in four standardised fear tests. Demonstration foals showed significantly reduced fear responses (behaviour and heart rate) and increased exploratory behaviour at both 8 weeks and 5 months of age. The effect was likely achieved through a combination of maternal transmission and individual learning. It is concluded that fearfulness in foals may be reduced through exposure to frightening objects together with their habituated mother during the first 8 weeks of life.","[Christensen, Janne Winther] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim Sci, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark",,"Christensen, JW (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim Sci, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.",jwc@anis.au.dk,,"Christensen, Janne Winther/0000-0003-0227-0648",Independent Research Council \ Technology and Production [0602-01907B],"The author would like to thank the studs and horse owners for participating in this study; Nanna Lysemose Frederiksen and Kristina Leth, for practical help with the experiments; Jens Malmkvist, Aarhus University, for comments on the manuscript.

Escape behaviour has evolved to allow an individual to escape once captured by a predator. We tested whether altered predation risk in urban environments is associated with colonization of such habitats by comparing escape behaviour of 1132 individual birds belonging to 15 species from nearby rural and urban populations when captured by a human. Raptors (of which the Eurasian sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was one of the most common species) were more common in rural than in urban habitats, whereas cats, Felis catus, showed the opposite pattern. There were consistent differences in escape behaviour between habitats, showing divergence in behaviour from the ancestral rural state. Urban birds wriggled less, showed higher tonic immobility, more often lost feathers, were less aggressive by biting less often, and emitted fear screams and alarm calls more often than rural birds. Furthermore, differences in escape behaviour between habitats were related to susceptibility to predation by sparrowhawks, as expected if differences in behaviour were due to differences in predation risk. Finally, an analysis of differences in escape behaviour between rural and urban birds revealed a significant relationship with time since urbanization, suggesting that escape behaviour has changed in urban environments over time. These findings suggest that release from predation and change in predator community associated with urbanization has altered the antipredator behaviour of birds colonizing towns and cities.

This fits into a burgeoning ecological paradigm suggesting that for both predator-prey and parasite-host interactions, non-consumptive effects (avoidance) can be orders of magnitude stronger than consumptive effects (sickness and death). Just as avoidance of predators and parasites imposes substantial costs on prey and hosts, altered behaviour to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 has impacted human fitness and wellbeing. But the effects of infectious disease avoidance do not stop there; non-consumptive effects of predators and parasites often trigger cascading indirect effects in natural systems. Similarly, shifts in human behaviour due to COVID-19 have triggered myriad indirect effects on species and the environment, which can be positive, negative or neutral. We urge researchers to recognize that the environmental impacts associated with lockdowns are indirect effects of the virus. In short, the global response to COVID-19 suggests that the non-consumptive effects of a pathogen, and resulting indirect effects, can be profound.","[Buck, Julia C.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, 601 S Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA; [Weinstein, Sara B.] Univ Utah, Sch Biol Sci, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Buck, JC (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, 601 S Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA.",buckj@uncw.edu,,"Buck, Julia/0000-0003-3202-7665",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 AI055434],S.B.W. was supported by training grant no.

However, our understanding of the relationship between hunting time schedule and risk-effect level remains limited. We investigated the relationships between hunting time schedule (the duration of the hunting operation and its execution interval) and the extent of sika deer (Cervus nippon) spatial displacement from hunting sites in hunting with and without driving (drive and stalk hunting, respectively) in the Tanzawa Mountains, Japan, 2016-2018. Driving in deer hunting means the action of making deer move by using dogs and/or hunters. We considered the probability of photographing deer with a camera trap after hunting operation per day (hazard) as an indicator of the extent of deer spatial displacement. Hazard was negatively associated with the duration of hunting operation in both drive and stalk hunting. In stalk hunting, hazard was also negatively associated with the number of days elapsed since the previous hunting operation in the same hunting site, whereas such an association was not observed in drive hunting. For drive hunting, in order to divert deer from hunting sites for a long time, hunting operations should be conducted throughout the day even if these operations are expected to end in a poor harvest. Conversely, for stalk hunting, short hunting-operation time and short execution interval days between each operation are required to reduce deer spatial displacement.

In addition, we used differences in behaviours expressed in the arena test to speculate on the aversiveness of the human, relative to the dog and goat. The behavioural responses of individual sheep were measured during a 10 min exposure to one of the stimuli, and differences between treatment groups were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test on ranked data (P < 0.01). An integrated index of fear-related behaviour was also calculated for each animal (fearfulness score). When the dog was present, test sheep stayed furthest from the group sheep, were highly vigilant and explored very little. The distance maintained from the group sheep was intermediate and similar with the goat and human, as were vigilance and exploration. However, while sheep often sniffed the goat, they rarely sniffed the human. The fearfulness scores indicate that the human elicited more fear-related behaviour than the goat (P < 0.001). The results of this experiment suggest that the arena test is an appropriate tool to test the relative aversiveness of different stimuli for individual sheep, that the dog was the most aversive stimulus presented, and that the human may have been slightly more aversive than the goat.

We evaluated the effects of ecological and anthropogenic factors on the density of migratory wildebeest and zebra and resident oribi in Zambia's Liuwa Plain National Park where human settlements were present. We conducted transect surveys from 2010 to 2013 using distance sampling methods and then developed a set of 38 candidate models to describe results and predict density. Models included the effects of variables in three classes: environmental (year, season, vegetation, predominant grass height, burn, water presence), predation risk (hyaena density) and anthropogenic (distance to park boundary and settlements). Densities ranged from 6.2 to 60.8individualskm(-2) for wildebeest, 1.1 to 14.5individualskm(-2) for oribi and 1.8 to 8.1individualskm(-2) for zebra. The most complex models were strongly supported for all three species. The magnitude and sign of variable effects differed among species, indicating that local densities of wildebeest, oribi and zebra are affected by a complex set of anthropogenic and ecological factors. Results reveal resource partitioning among ungulate species and indicate that predation risk and proximity to humans affect ungulate distributions with implications for managing migrations in the Greater Liuwa Ecosystem.","[M'soka, Jassiel; Creel, Scott; Becker, Matthew S.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, 310 Lewis Hall,POB 173460, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [M'soka, Jassiel; Creel, Scott; Becker, Matthew S.] Zambian Carnivore Programme, POB 80, Mfuwe, Zambia; [M'soka, Jassiel] Dept Natl Pk & Wildlife, Private Bag 1,Kafue Rd, Chilanga, Zambia; [Murdoch, James D.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 81 Carrigan Dr, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",,"M'soka, J (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, 310 Lewis Hall,POB 173460, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.; M'soka, J (corresponding author), Zambian Carnivore Programme, POB 80, Mfuwe, Zambia.; M'soka, J (corresponding author), Dept Natl Pk & Wildlife, Private Bag 1,Kafue Rd, Chilanga, Zambia.",jassielmsoka@gmail.com,,,WWF Netherlands; African Parks Network; National Science Foundation Animal Behaviour Program [IOS-1145749]; Painted Dog Conservation Inc.; Lee Schink Memorial Scholarship from the Wildlife Conservation Network,"We thank the Zambia Wildlife Authority, African Parks and the Barotse Royal Establishment for their collaboration and permission to conduct this research.

According to risk-sensitive foraging theory, animals should make foraging decisions that balance nutritional costs and gains to promote fitness. Human disturbance is a form of perceived risk that can prompt avoidance of risky habitat over acquisition of food. Consequently, behavioural responses to perceived risk could induce nutritional costs. 2. Population declines often coincide with increases in human disturbance, which likely is associated with direct and indirect habitat loss. Nevertheless, behavioural and physiological responses to perceived risks associated with human disturbance could be an added nutritional deficit with population-level repercussions. 3. Using GPS-collar data from three populations of migratory mule deer Odocoileus hemionus exposed to a gradient of established industrial energy development on winter ranges where direct and indirect habitat loss were well documented, we evaluated whether exposure and behavioural responses to human disturbance alter changes in nutritional condition (i.e. fat reserves) over winter. 4. Although animals exhibited behaviours indicative of perceived risk of human disturbance, such as increased movement rates and avoidance of infrastructure, exposure and behavioural responses to human disturbance had little to no measurable effect on fat loss over a winter. Instead, catabolism of fat reserves occurred primarily as a function of the amount of fat animals had entering winter, suggesting that, in the short term, animals were able to mitigate the energetic costs of perceived risk of human disturbance over winter. Animals, however, did not appear to overcome persistent food limitations, and animals with less food availability lost more fat over winter. 5. Our findings heed caution in using short-term behavioural and physiological responses to inform long-term nutritional consequences of human disturbance. Although animals appear to mitigate the energetic costs of perceived risk, food limitations exacerbated by broader-scale avoidance of food near human disturbance may be the primary pathway causing the frequently observed population declines following human disturbance to pristine landscapes.","[Dwinnell, Samantha P.

Using fine-scale spatial analyses, we examined how proximity to human settlements affects antipredator responses of ungulates. We studied seven common ungulate species (Kirk's dik-dik, Thomson's gazelle, impala, common warthog, common wildebeest, common zebra and Masai giraffe) in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem in northern Tanzania. In zebra and giraffe, flight responses to humans were significantly more likely when closer to settlements; however, there was a weak relationship between flight responses and distance to settlement in all other species. While there was largely a weak relationship between proximity to human settlements, the distribution of settlements in the landscape appears to affect wildlife behaviour, suggesting that animals perceive and respond to spatial variation in risk exerted by humans.

In Europe, the recolonization of large carnivores often occurs in areas where humans have greatly modified the landscape through forestry or agriculture. Currently, we poorly understand the effects of recolonizing large carnivores on extant prey species in anthropogenic landscapes. Here, we investigated if ungulate prey species showed innate responses to the scent of a regionally exterminated but native large carnivore, and whether the responses were affected by human-induced habitat openness. We experimentally introduced brown bear Ursus arctos scent to artificial feeding sites and used camera traps to document the responses of three sympatric ungulate species. In addition to controls without scent, reindeer scent Rangifer tarandus was used as a noncarnivore, novel control scent. Fallow deer Dama dama strongly avoided areas with bear scent. In the presence of bear scent, all ungulate species generally used open sites more than closed sites, whereas the opposite was observed at sites with reindeer scent or without scent. The opening of forest habitat by human practices, such as forestry and agriculture, creates a larger gradient in habitat openness than available in relatively unaffected closed forest systems, which may create opportunities for prey to alter their habitat selection and reduce predation risk in human-modified systems that do not exist in more natural forest systems. Increased knowledge about antipredator responses in areas subjected to anthropogenic change is important because these responses may affect prey population dynamics, lower trophic levels, and attitudes toward large carnivores. These aspects may be of particular relevance in the light of the increasing wildlife populations across much of Europe.","[Sahlen, Ellinor; Kindberg, Jonas; Spong, Goran; Cromsigt, Joris P. G.

The Risk Hypothesis posits that the costs of intergroup conflict create a landscape of fear, discouraging the use of such shared areas. To test this hypothesis, we observed the behavior of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in central vs. peripheral areas of their home ranges. If capuchins perceive areas of home range overlap as risky, we predicted they would change activity budgets, vocalization rates, and foraging behavior in these areas. A spatially explicit behavioral comparison based on nearly 100 h of focal follows revealed that capuchins socialize less in the periphery (vs. the center) of their home range. Time spent resting, foraging, and engaging in vigilance, as well as vocalization rates, varied in consistent ways across all four study groups, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Fruit trees near range borders (vs. the center) contained more ripe fruit, and groups spent more time in these trees, with more individuals entering to feed and consuming more fruits. However, capuchins did not alter their foraging behavior in potentially risky peripheral areas in a manner consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory: intake rates at patch departure were not significantly lower and groups depleted trees to a greater extent along the periphery vs. in the center of their range. These results suggest that while peripheral areas are perceived as risky and this landscape of fear contributes to behavioral changes, they also provide resources whose value may outweigh the cost of intergroup encounters.","[Torrez-Herrera, Lucia L.; Davis, Grace H.; Crofoot, Margaret C.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Davis, Grace H.; Crofoot, Margaret C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Crofoot, Margaret C.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Crofoot, Margaret C.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Crofoot, Margaret C.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Ecol Anim Soc, Constance, Germany",,"Davis, GH; Crofoot, MC (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama.; Davis, GH; Crofoot, MC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Crofoot, MC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Crofoot, MC (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany.; Crofoot, MC (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Ecol Anim Soc, Constance, Germany.",ghdavis@ucdavis.edu; mcrofoot@ab.mpg.de,,"Davis, Grace/0000-0003-1711-6985",Wenner-Gren Foundation; Leakey Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-1440755]; Packard Foundation Fellowship; UC Davis Evolutionary Anthropology Summer Fellowship; Hemispheric Institute of the Americas; Tinker Foundation; Explorer's Club; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute short-term fellowshipSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; UC Davis Provost's Fellowship; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); National GeographicNational Geographic Society; NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant,"We thank the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for permission to conduct this research, and for the important logistical support provided by members of the staff on Barro Colorado Island, particularly Melissa Cano, Oris Acevedo, and Adriana Bilgray.

To explore effects of habitat patchiness and variation in perceived risk of predation on food-web dynamics, we conducted a factorial experiment in a model aquatic food chain of predator-prey-resource using 2 contrasting predators (adult blue crab Callinectes sapidus and toad fish Opsanus tau), juvenile blue crab as prey, and mussel Geukensia demissa as resource. Both predator presence and habitat patchiness influenced the prey's preference for consuming resources at patch edges instead of interiors. The preference of prey for consuming resources at habitat edges was 4 times stronger in continuous oyster reef habitat than in smaller habitat patches. This suggests that interior resources in continuous habitat experience a refuge from consumption, but this refuge is largely lost in patchy habitat. The mere presence of predators reduced the prey's preference for consuming resources at habitat edges. This BMIE was significant for the ambush predator (toadfish) and the treatment containing both predators, but not for the actively hunting predator (adult blue crab). We conclude that habitat patchiness and predator presence can jointly affect resource distribution by inducing shifts in prey foraging behavior, revealing a need to incorporate BMIEs into habitat fragmentation studies. This conclusion has broad and growing relevance as anthropogenic factors increasingly modify predator abundances and fragment coastal habitats.","[Macreadie, Peter I.; Geraldi, Nathan R.; Peterson, Charles H.] Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; [Macreadie, Peter I.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Environm, Ctr Environm Sustainabil, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",,"Macreadie, PI (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",peter.macreadie@uts.edu.au,"Geraldi, Nathan/AAA-3645-2020","Geraldi, Nathan/0000-0002-2669-3867",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ecological Effects of Sea Level Rise Program; North Carolina Coastal Recreational Fishing License Program; Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology; Dow Chemical Company Fellowship; Brian Robinson Fellowship; NOAA National Estuarine Research Reserve Fellowship,"We thank L.

Flexibility in large carnivore behavior may be a primary factor mediating coexistence with people, allowing carnivores to calibrate their activity and habitat use to the perceived level of human risk. However, our understanding of how large carnivores adjust the timing and location of behaviors in response to variations in human activity across the landscape remains limited, impacting our ability to identify important habitat for populations outside of protected areas. Here we examine whether African lions (Panthera leo) modify their behavior and habitat use in response to risk of a human encounter, and whether behavior-specific habitat selection allows lions to access feeding opportunities in a human-dominated landscape in Kenya. We determined fine-scale behavioral states for lions using high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data, and then investigated behavior-specific habitat selection at multiple temporal and spatial scales (ranging from 15 minutes to 12 hours and from approximately 200 meters to several kilometers). We found that lions exhibit substantial differences in habitat selection with respect to humans based on behavioral state and time of day. During the day, when risk of human encounter is highest, lions avoided areas of high human use when resting, meandering, and feeding. However, lions specifically selected for habitat near people when feeding at night. Flexible habitat use by lions thus permits access to prey, which appear to concentrate in areas near humans. The importance of habitat near people for feeding was only apparent when analyses explicitly accounted for lion behavioral state and spatiotemporal scale, highlighting the necessity of incorporating such information when investigating human impacts on large carnivore habitat use. Our results support the contention that behavior-specific habitat selection promotes carnivore persistence in human-dominated landscapes, demonstrating the importance of considering not just whether but how large carnivores use habitat near humans when managing vulnerable populations.","[Suraci, Justin P.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Frank, Laurence G.; Ekwanga, Steve] Mpala Res Ctr, Living Lions, Nanyuki 10400, Kenya; [Frank, Laurence G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne] Univ Oxford, Zool Dept, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon OX135QL, Oxon, England; [Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne] Lion Landscapes, New Rd, Highcliffe TQ148UL, Teignmouth, England; [Williams, Terrie M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Suraci, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",justin.suraci@gmail.com,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0963022, 1255913]; Butler Conservation Fund; Ewaso Lions; Living with Lions","We thank the government of Kenya and Kenya Wildlife Service for permission to carry out this work, and the land owners and ranch managers of Laikipia for their collaboration.

We tested 20 domesticated White Leghorn (WL) chickens and their ancestors, red junglefowl (RJF), in four different fear tests (Open Field, Novel Object. Aerial Predator, and Fear for Humans). The tests were designed to measure reactions to different types of potentially fearful stimuli. The correlations between durations of the same four variables from each of the tests (Stand/sit alert, Locomotion, Fly/jump, and Vocalisation) were analysed with principal components analysis (PCA). In the PCA, 33.5% of the variation in responses was explained by a single factor, interpreted as a general fear factor. Higher scores on this were related to stronger fear reactions. Red jungle fowl scored significantly higher than White Leghorns wet on this factor, and also had a longer latency to feed in the Fear of Humans-test, used as an independent measure of fear in the same tests. The results suggest that selection for low fearfulness has been an important element of domestication. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A better understanding of the factors triggering such attacks is critical to mitigating the risk of future encounters in landscapes where humans and large carnivores coexist. Since 1955, of the 632 attacks on humans by large carnivores, 106 (17%) involved predation. We draw on concepts and empirical evidence from the Predator-Prey Interaction Theory to provide insights into how to reduce predatory attacks and, thus, improve human-large carnivore coexistence. Because large carnivore-caused mortality risks for humans are comparable to those shown by other mammal species in response to predation risk, framing predatory attacks under a theory underpinning predator-prey interactions may represent a powerful tool for minimizing large carnivore attacks. Most large carnivores have marked crepuscular and nocturnal activity; by minimizing outdoor activities in high-risk areas from sunset to sunrise, humans could reduce the number of predatory attacks. The most effective way in which prey avoid predation, but still utilize risky areas, is by adopting temporal changes in activity patterns. The human age groups most often targeted by large carnivores are essentially the same as when predators in general search for prey, namely the youngest individuals. Thus, increased parental vigilance and education for children may be a key factor to reduce predatory attacks. Lastly, because group size can affect predator-prey encounter rates and outcomes in different ways, large groups of people can decrease predation rates. Many humans may no longer consider predation by large carnivores to be a logical or plausible consequence of our predator-naive behavior because humans now only occasionally represent prey for such species. However, the solution to the conflicts represented by large carnivore attacks on humans requires the implementation of correct strategies to face these rare events.","[Penteriani, Vincenzo; Bombieri, Giulia; Lopez-Bao, Jose Vicente; Francesco Russo, Luca; del Mar Delgado, Maria] Oviedo Univ, UMIB, UO CSIC PA, Res Unit Biodivers, Campus Mieres, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Penteriani, Vincenzo] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Fedriani, Jose Maria; Garrote, Pedro Jose] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopez-Bao, Jose Vicente] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, S-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden",,"Penteriani, V (corresponding author), Oviedo Univ, UMIB, UO CSIC PA, Res Unit Biodivers, Campus Mieres, Mieres 33600, Spain.; Penteriani, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",penteriani@ebd.csic.es,"Bombieri, Giulia/W-9305-2019","Russo, Luca Francesco/0000-0003-4379-6160",,,,51,8,8,1,58,JACK H BERRYMAN INST,LOGAN,"UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT WILDLAND RESOURCES, LOGAN, UTAH 84322-5230 USA",1934-4392,1936-8046,,HUM-WILDL INTERACT,Hum.-Wildl.

In systems with high predation risk, prey display adjustments that can challenge resource acquisition. In such cases, prey may be limited in their ability to adjust their behaviour further in response to additional risk, such as that posed by human hunters (hunting risk). We investigated whether large African herbivores adjust their behaviour in response to hunting risk. In Hwange National Park (HNP), Zimbabwe, and in the peripheral hunting areas (HA), we monitored behaviour of impala, Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, and sable antelope, Hippotragus niger, at waterholes. Once groups entered waterhole areas, their probability of returning to vegetation cover without drinking was higher in HA than in HNP. Individuals were more vigilant in HA than in HNP when they were approaching and leaving waterholes, but not during drinking. This suggests that drinking was prioritized over vigilance once individuals reached waterholes. The time that groups spent in waterhole areas did not differ significantly between HA and HNP, but individuals in HA were more vigilant, suggesting that groups limited their exposure to hunters. Greater kudus were the most vigilant, probably because they are the most vulnerable to predators. Sable antelopes were the least prone to compromise the acquisition of surface water. Both species consequently displayed adjustments of lower magnitude than impala in response to hunting risk. Our multispecies study illustrates how vulnerability to natural predators and environmental constraints limit behavioural responses of large herbivores to hunting risk.

Previous studies have shown that several species can learn to discriminate between individual people and assess risk based on prior experience. To avoid potentially costly encounters, it may also pay individuals to learn about dangerous people based on information from others. Social learning about anthropogenic threats is likely to be beneficial in habitats dominated by human activity, but experimental evidence is limited. Here, we tested whether wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula) use social learning to recognize dangerous people. Using a within-subjects design, we presented breeding jackdaws with an unfamiliar person near their nest, combined with conspecific alarm calls. Subjects that heard alarm calls showed a heightened fear response in subsequent encounters with the person compared to a control group, reducing their latency to return to the nest.

Conflicts between large mammalian predators and humans present a challenge to conservation efforts, as these events drive human attitudes and policies concerning predator species. Unfortunately, generalities portrayed in many empirical carnivore landscape selection studies do not provide an explanation for a predator's occasional use of residential development preceding a carnivore-human conflict event. In some cases, predators may perceive residential development as a risk-reward trade-off. 2. We examine whether state-dependent mortality risk-sensitive foraging can explain an apex carnivore's (Puma concolor) occasional utilization of residential areas. We assess whether puma balance the risk and rewards in a system characterized by a gradient of housing densities ranging from wildland to suburban. Puma GPS location data, characterized as hunting and feeding locations, were used to assess landscape variables governing hunting success and hunting site selection. Hunting site selection behaviour was then analysed conditional on indicators of hunger state. 3. Residential development provided a high energetic reward to puma based on increases in prey availability and hunting success rates associated with increased housing density. Despite a higher energetic reward, hunting site selection analysis indicated that pumas generally avoided residential development, a landscape type attributed with higher puma mortality risk. However, when a puma experienced periods of extended hunger, risk avoidance behaviour towards housing waned. 4. This study demonstrates that an apex carnivore faces a trade-off between acquiring energetic rewards and avoiding risks associated with human housing. Periods of hunger can help explain an apex predator's occasional use of developed landscapes and thus the rare conflicts in the wildland-urban interface. Apex carnivore movement behaviours in relation to human conflicts are best understood as a three-player community-level interaction incorporating wild prey distribution.","[Blecha, Kevin A.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Boone, Randall B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Boone, Randall B.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resources Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Alldredge, Mathew W.] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, Mammals Res Sect, Ft Collins, CO USA",,"Blecha, KA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",kevin.blecha@gmail.com,"Boone, Randall B/N-6566-2013","Boone, Randall B/0000-0003-3362-2976; Blecha, Kevin/0000-0002-9284-0685",U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service [W-204-R1]; Colorado Parks and Wildlife Game Cash Funds,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Grant/Award Number: Federal Aid Grant #W-204-R1; Colorado Parks and Wildlife Game Cash Funds",,88,35,36,1,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Worldwide, innate fear (ophidiophobia), culturally-founded superstition, and myths have caused pervasive snake persecution, snakebite mismanagement, human injuries, and fatalities, particularly in the tropics. We analyzed 20 common snake myths narrated by 934 respondents inhabiting a typical rural savanna community of northern Ghana. The myths summarized perceived, self-assessed knowledge about snakes and were evaluated in their zoo-ecological contexts versus their folkloristic explanatory origins. Only eight snake myths (similar to 40%) had any justifiable scientific basis, partially representing misinterpretations among predominantly male, less-educated respondents. Contrastingly, 70% of the myths were largely rooted in ophidiophobia, representing a major driver of human-wildlife conflict and indiscriminate snake persecution. To promote wildlife-friendly perceptions and behavior toward snakes and their conservation, we recommend innovative gap-bridging conservation education and public awareness that reconciles myths and realities about snakes, thus reducing snakebite incidences, mortality, and widespread persecution and killing of snakes.","[Musah, Yahaya; Attuquayefio, Daniel K.; Pobee, Abigail N.

Adaptation to predation risk is important in an evolutionary sense: caution could be beneficial for reducing the risk of injury and mortality; on the other hand, reacting too soon and too often can cause stress, costs energy and may lower survival. This study compares the extent of tolerance to human disturbance in two introduced but established waterfowl species, Greylag Geese Anser anser (Anserinae) and Egyptian Geese Alopochen aegyptiaca (Tadorninae). After their recent colonisation of the city of Stuttgart in southwest Germany, Greylag Geese first hatched a brood in 1995, while Egyptian Geese only latterly colonised the city (first successfully fledged brood in 2010), but subsequently showed exponential population increase. There are many potential reasons for this; they may have a broader ecological niche (i.e. are able to use a wider array of available nesting sites), and have larger broods with higher fledging rates, but Egyptian Geese may also show higher tolerance towards disturbance than Greylag Geese in an urban setting. We investigated the last of these hypotheses by comparing variation between the two species in their reaction to disturbance stimuli between 5 June and 22 August 2018. Our behavioural observations showed that Egyptian Geese reacted to disturbance stimuli > 50% more frequently than Greylag Geese, and with more intense behaviours. In addition to species-specific differences, we found that reaction to disturbance also varied with location, the type of disturbance, social status, time of day and ambient temperature. Both species reacted most strongly (i.e. were alerted or displaced at greater distances) when disturbed by dogs. Egyptian Geese were generally more cautious than Greylag Geese to equivalent stimuli from human presence. Such cautiousness may, in addition to ecological differences, partly explain the greater success of Egyptian Geese as an invading species in novel environments. Alternatively, this difference between the two species may reflect a longer habituation period, or perhaps genetic adaptation to disturbance stimuli by Greylag Geese.","[Hohmann, Rieke; Woog, Friederike] Staat Museum Naturkunde Stuttgart, Rosenstein 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany",,"Woog, F (corresponding author), Staat Museum Naturkunde Stuttgart, Rosenstein 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany.",friederike.woog@smns-bw.de,,,,,,58,1,1,3,3,WILDFOWL & WETLANDS TRUST,SLIMBRIDGE,"SLIMBRIDGE, GLOS, GL2 7BT, UK",0954-6324,2052-6458,,WILDFOWL,WILDFOWL,,2021,71,,,,,,244,261,,,,,18,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,XI3TV,WOS:000726039300015,,,,,2022-04-19,

Contrary to this common sense-based scientific point of view, I have argued that what we have inherited from our mammalian ancestors, and they from their distal vertebrate ancestors, and they from their chordate ancestors, and so forth, is not a fear circuit. It is, instead, a defensive survival circuit that detects threats, and in response, initiates defensive survival behaviours and supporting physiological adjustments. Seen in this light, the defensive survival circuits of humans and other mammals can be conceptualized as manifestations of an ancient survival function-the ability to detect danger and respond to it-that may in fact predate animals and their nervous systems, and perhaps may go back to the beginning of life. Fear, on the other hand, from my perspective, is a product of cortical cognitive circuits. This conception is not just of academic interest. It also has practical implications, offering clues as to why efforts to treat problems related to fear and anxiety are not more effective, and what might make them better.

Fragmentation is likely to lead to changes in predation risk, which may cause behavioral responses with possible population level consequences. It has recently been shown that the awareness of predator presence, resulting in a fear response, strongly affects behavior and physiology of the prey individuals. Costs arising from fear may be as important for the prey population size as the direct killing of prey. We tested how predation risk in the form of scent of a specialist predator, the least weasel (Mustela nivalis nivalis), affects bank vole (Myodes glareolus) behavior in fragmented enclosures consisting of either non-fragmented (one patch) or fragmented (four patches) habitats of the same total area. Vole movement areas tended to be larger in the non-fragmented habitat. Fear decreased vole activity and tended to increase the use of the open matrix area. No interactions between fragmentation and fear treatments or differences in breeding related behaviors or fitness were found in our short-term experiment. However, behavioral mechanisms such as decreased activity and change of movements to the risky matrix could cause negative effects and population decline in the long run. Fragmentation is a serious issue in all human exploited habitats causing animals to face more risks compared to more uniform and sheltering environments. This should be especially taken into account in conservation of habitat and the reintroduction of captive reared animals where both intact sheltering habitats and food providing have habitats become rarer.

However, few studies have addressed the behaviour of prey species during and after human capture and handling and how this may correlate to individual characteristics or variation in their physical environment they inhabit. We explored wood mouse's fleeing and aggressive behaviours in response to captures by human in their natural habitat. Eighty-seven wood mice were caught using Sherman live traps. For each trapped individual, aggressiveness was measured as the total number of bites inflicted upon the investigator during handling time. Afterwards, each mouse was released in a two-metre radius partially covered vegetation area that allowed visual mouse tracking by the observer and flight behaviour was registered by individual one-zero focal sampling technique during 2min. Both aggressiveness and fleeing behaviour were analysed regarding individual (sex, reproductive status, age) and environmental factors (habitat and season). Males, adults and breeding individuals showed heightened aggression levels. Higher aggressiveness levels were found in wood mice occupying scrubland and during summer and autumn. The flight response was exclusively explained by reproductive status, whereby breeding individuals spent more time on fast escape than nonbreeding ones. These results indicate that both individual and environmental factors seem to influence defensive behaviours in the wood mouse during and after being captured by a human. Since human disturbance shares many aspects with the predation risk, behavioural responses found to captures may likely be influenced by previous experience of individuals with predators as well as to seasonal and habitat features conditioning predators' densities but also protection against them.","[Hernandez, MaCarmen; Navarro-Castilla, Alvaro; Barja, Isabel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Madrid, Spain; [Pineiro, Ana] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ciencias Vida, Escuela Med Vet, Santiago, Chile",,"Hernandez, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Unidad Zool, Dept Biol, C Darwin 2,Campus Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",mariacarmen.hernandez@uam.es,"Navarro-Castilla, Álvaro/M-7315-2018; Hernández, Dra.

Although some species may habituate to human presence, other species do not show any signs of habituation, and may even be sensitized or affected by human disturbance. Furthermore, anthropogenic effects on bird behaviour rarely have been explored to address the alteration of frequencies of aggressive and fear-associated behaviours. Such behavioural approaches may provide substantial data for bird conservation and management. Therefore, we assessed whether human disturbance disrupts the normal behaviour of Burrowing Owls Athene cunicularia. Specifically, we assessed whether guarding parents exhibited aggressive and fearful behaviours differentially in areas where human contact was more common. Burrowing Owls showed increased frequencies of threat displays in sites with more people walking by the nests, but not fear behaviours. These results suggest that different domains of behaviour (aggression vs. fear) may respond differently to human disturbance. We highlight the importance of quantifying a wide range of behavioural acts as indicators of bird stress in studies of anthropogenic impact.","[Moroni, Edson; Crivelaro, Amanda Zanesco; Soares, Tainara Luiza] UFGD, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Dourados, MS, Brazil; [Guillermo-Ferreira, Rhainer] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Dept Hydrobiol, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",,"Guillermo-Ferreira, R (corresponding author), Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Dept Hydrobiol, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",rhainerguillermo@gmail.com,"Guillermo-Ferreira, Rhainer/A-7119-2013; Ferreira, Rhainer Guillermo/ABH-2294-2021","Ferreira, Rhainer Guillermo/0000-0001-7774-5252",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP),We thank CNPq and FAPESP for continuing financial support.

Athough many are well designed and analytically sophisticated, most lack a theoretical framework for making predictions and for understanding why particular responses occur. Behavioral ecologists have recently begun to fill this theoretical vacuum by applying economic models of antipredator behavior to disturbance studies. In this emerging paradigm, predation and nonlethal disturbance stimuli create similar trade-offs between avoiding perceived risk and other fitness-enhancing activities, such as feeding, parental care, or mating. A vast literature supports the hypothesis that antipredator behavior has a cost to other activities, and that this trade-off is optimized when investment in antipredator behavior tracks short-term changes in predation risk. Prey have evolved antipredator responses to generalized threatening stimuli, such as loud noises and rapidly approaching objects. Thus, when encountering disturbance stimuli ranging from the dramatic, low-flying helicopter to the quiet wildlife photographer, animal responses are likely to follow the same economic principles used by prey encountering predators. Some authors have argued that, similar to predation risk, disturbance stimuli can indirectly affect fitness and population dynamics via the energetic and lost opportunity costs of risk avoidance. We elaborate on this argument by discussing why, from an evolutionary perspective, disturbance stimuli should be analogous to predation risk. We then consider disturbance effects on the behavior of individuals-vigilance, fleeing, habitat selection, mating displays, and parental investment-as well as indirect effects on populations and communities. A wider application of predation risk theory to disturbance studies should increase the generality of predictions and make mitigation more effective without over-regulating human activities.","Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",,"Frid, A (corresponding author), POB 10357, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 7A1, Canada.",,,,,,,94,1130,1201,10,561,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1195-5449,,,CONSERV ECOL,Conserv.

This review demonstrates that defensive behaviors change during early life in mammals. First, unlearned responses are reorganized during early ontogeny and expressed in an age-specific way. Second, the expression of defensive responses is influenced by early experience prior to the first encounter with a threat. Third, once animals have been exposed to a threatening stimulus they subsequently modify their behavior. The neural bases of defensive behavior and the processes that alter them during development are discussed. Maturation of components and connections of the fear circuit seem to contribute to changes in unlearned fear responses. Early experience and learning modify these developmental processes and shape the expression of defensive behavior. Continuous reorganization of the neural substrate and defensive behavior during ontogeny seems to allow the animal to adjust to the conditions it encounters at a given age in a given environment. It is proposed that the developmental changes in defensive behavior can be conceptualized as phenotypic plasticity. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Our purpose is to examine the theoretical and applied role that behavioural principles play in understanding and mitigating human-wildlife conflict, and delineate gaps in behavioural theory relative to mitigating these conflicts. Specifically, we consider two different, yet contemporary, examples of human-wildlife conflict: animal-vehicle collisions and carnivore depredation of livestock. Although ostensibly unrelated, both conflict areas share common themes relative to animal behavioural responses to disturbance and perception of risk. We first place the effects on wildlife due to these conflicts in the scope of population sustainability, and then examine current research relative to the following three questions. How is behavioural ecology relevant to these particular areas of conflict? Are advances toward understanding the mechanisms by which animals process information and make decisions being translated into management methods? How might management efforts be affected over time by individual behaviours, method integration and habituation/sensitization? Regarding animal-vehicle collisions, only in the last decade have researchers applied an antipredator theoretical framework with sensory ecology to understand aspects of marine mammal, terrestrial mammal and bird responses to vehicle approach, speed and associated stimuli. However, the size and speeds of modern vehicles demand that we improve economic models and possibly develop novel theoretical frameworks to better predict animal responses to vehicle approach. Within the context of carnivore-livestock depredation, our understanding of individual predator behaviour relative to perceived risk and factors contributing to the development of problem individuals will influence the efficacy of the most promising, nonlethal management approaches (e.g. distractive techniques, reproductive inhibition and olfactory barriers). In both cases, successful management is contingent upon a mechanistic understanding of how animals respond to disturbance and the information utilized to assess risk.

To avoid human threats while exploiting opportunities, animals may adjust their spatiotemporal activity, using areas of anthropogenic disturbance at night when people are less active. We combined four camera trap datasets from Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park to evaluate the effects of roads and settlement on diel activity patterns of elephants (Loxodonta africana). We found high rates of elephant activity along the boundary of the park, where elephants can access cultivated crops, and along roads, which serve as movement corridors. However, elephants restricted their activity to the night and crepuscular periods in these areas of human disturbance, seeking refuge in the interior of the park away from roads and settlements during the day. Our findings suggest that a history of killing and antagonism has instilled a fear of humans in this elephant population, with implications for research, tourism and human-elephant coexistence. Our study highlights the utility of camera traps in monitoring human-wildlife conflict and habituation and demonstrates the value of integrating disparate camera trap datasets for comparative analyses on landscape or even continental scales.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Branco, Paola; Long, Ryan] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Goncalves, Dominique] Gorongosa Natl Pk, Dept Sci Serv, Gorongosa, Mozambique; [Goncalves, Dominique] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Granli, Petter; Poole, Joyce] ElephantVoices, Sandefjord, Norway",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kgaynor@berkeley.edu,,"Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Elephant Crisis Fund; Crystal Springs Foundation; UC Berkeley Center for African Studies; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Explorers Club; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Rufford Foundation; Idea Wild; Save the Elephants; Gorongosa Restoration Project; United States Agency for International DevelopmentUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID); University of Idaho College of Natural Resources,"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: GRFP; Elephant Crisis Fund; Crystal Springs Foundation; UC Berkeley Center for African Studies; National Geographic Society; Explorers Club; Idea Wild; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Rufford Foundation; Save the Elephants; Gorongosa Restoration Project; United States Agency for International Development; University of Idaho College of Natural Resources",,69,20,20,7,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

We studied the vigilance behaviour of red deer in the Scottish Highlands, in sites with traditionally high numbers of visitors ('disturbed') and sites with relatively few visitors ('less-disturbed') during the main recreational season (spring and summer), and in their mating grounds during the hunting season (autumn and winter). We carried out direct observations, using scan sampling at 3-minute intervals for 1-hour periods, and recorded the number of animals in each group that were vigilant and their mode of vigilance. During the recreational season, in both the disturbed and less-disturbed sites, data were collected in habitats with different levels of cover (grassland, heather and woodland). The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher in disturbed than in less-disturbed sites, and higher in disturbed grassland (poor cover) and heather (intermediate cover) than in disturbed woodland (good cover). The majority of the vigilant animals in disturbed heather and woodland habitats and in all the less-disturbed habitats were standing. In disturbed grassland, however, lying was the main posture whilst vigilant. In both disturbed grassland and heather, the percentage of vigilant animals that were moving was higher than in woodland or the less-disturbed habitats. In disturbed sites, the deer were more likely to be aggregated when vigilance levels were high. During the hunting season, the overall level of vigilance was higher than at any sites during the recreational season, and the majority of vigilant animals were moving. We conclude that red deer respond to disturbance from human recreational activities by increasing their level of vigilance, but that the nature of their response varies with the level of cover available. We suggest that red deer may lie down when keeping vigil in grasslands, because lying animals are less conspicuous and the low cover will still allow animals to scan their surroundings. We conclude that, although they respond to both types of disturbance by increasing vigilance, red deer perceive human recreation as a less acute threat than hunting.","[Jayakody, Sevvandi; Sibbald, Angela M.] Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Jayakody, Sevvandi; Lambin, Xavier] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Gordon, Iain J.] CSIRO, Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia",,"Sibbald, AM (corresponding author), Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",s.jayakody@macaulay.ac.uk; angela.sibbald@macaulay.ac.uk; iain.gordon@csiro.au; x.lambin@abdn.ac.uk,"Gordon, Iain J/K-8636-2012; Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011; Gordon, Iain/S-8076-2019","Gordon, Iain J/0000-0001-9704-0946; Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Gordon, Iain/0000-0001-9704-0946; Jayakody, Sevvandi/0000-0001-9600-4986",,,,53,67,70,4,140,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,MAR,2008,14,1,,,,,81,91,,10.2981/0909-6396(2008)14[81:RDCEVB]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,301US,WOS:000255921800009,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-19,

Recently the concept of the ecology of fear has been defined and formalised; yet there has been relatively little focus on how these ideas apply to large carnivore species which, although not prey sensu stricto, also experience fear as a result of threats from humans. Large carnivores are likely also subject to a Landscape of Fear similar to that described for prey species. We argue that although fear is generic, 'human-caused mortality' represents a distinct and very important cause of fear for large carnivores, particularly terrestrial large carnivores as their activities overlap with those of humans to a greater degree. We introduce the idea of a 'Landscape of Coexistence' for large carnivores to denote a subset of the Landscape of Fear where sufficient areas of low human-caused mortality risk are present in the landscape for long term coexistence of large carnivores and humans. We then explore aspects of terrestrial large carnivore behavioural ecology that may be best explained by risk of human-caused mortality, and how the nature of a Landscape of Coexistence for these large carnivores is likely to be shaped by specific factors such as habitat structure, wild and domestic prey base, and human distribution and behaviour. The human characteristics of this Landscape of Coexistence may be as important in determining large carnivore distribution and behavioural ecology as the distribution of resources. Understanding the Landscape of Coexistence for terrestrial large carnivores is therefore important for their biology and conservation throughout large parts of their remaining ranges.","[Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne; Valeix, Marion; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Dept Zool, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Valeix, Marion] Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5558, FR-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne; Frank, Laurence G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Living Lions, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Riginos, Corinna] Teton Sci Sch, Teton Res Inst, Jackson, WY 83001 USA",,"Oriol-Cotterill, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Dept Zool, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",alayne.cotterill@gmail.com,"Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010","Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne/0000-0003-0049-7988",Panthera; Wildlife Conservation Society; Univ. of Oxford WildCRU; Bosack and Kruger Foundation; Arthur M.

We investigated the influence of food availability, predation risk, and the perceived predation risk on habitat use by a primate living under high hunting pressure, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus xanthosternos, at Una Biological Reserve (ReBio Una). We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect. We confirmed our prediction that in a habitat with high hunting pressure, the risk of predation, both perceived and actual, had a more significant impact on how yellow-breasted capuchins used space than did food availability.","[Suscke, Priscila; Izar, Patricia] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychol, Dept Expt Psychol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Presotto, Andrea] Salisbury Univ, Dept Geog & Geosci, Salisbury, MD USA",,"Suscke, P (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Expt Psychol, Av Prof Mello Moraes 1721, BR-05508020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",psuscke@hotmail.com,"; Izar, Patricia/C-3445-2012","Presotto, Andrea/0000-0002-2805-5113; Izar, Patricia/0000-0001-6741-0731","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [10/51252-1, 10/51455-0]","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, Grant/Award Number: 10/51252-1 and 10/51455-0",,77,1,1,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-2565,1098-2345,,AM J PRIMATOL,Am.

Following the practices of landowners, hunters, and managers in the area, as situated and vernacular knowledges of deer behavior, perception, and habitat preferences (that is, as ethno-ethological knowledge), we show how the Soby landscape is constructed as an environment that entices and entraps large populations of deer, in particular the large and highly prized game animal, red deer (Cervus elaphus). Engaging with the ecological concept of the landscape of fear, which predicts that predation pressure structures how prey species utilize vegetation, terrain, and gradients between habitat types, we show how landowners actually work to generate a landscape of calmness in order to encourage large populations of deer to dwell on their property holdings. In working to produce the opposite of a landscape of fear, we show that it is the humans that end up feeling subject to surveillance and the risk of encounter, and modulate their activities and movements in the landscape according to anticipations of where deer are and how they behave. In the interactions between humans and deer that shape the landscape, other forms of affect emerge and in turn alter species relations.","[Forssman, Natalie] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anthropol, Moesgard Alle 20, DK-8270 Hojbjerg, Denmark; [Root-Bernstein, Meredith] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Aarhus, Denmark; [Root-Bernstein, Meredith] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Sci Act & Dev,Act,Prod,Terr, Paris, France",,"Forssman, N (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Anthropol, Moesgard Alle 20, DK-8270 Hojbjerg, Denmark.",natalie.forssman@gmail.com,,"Root-Bernstein, Meredith/0000-0002-2513-1248","Danish National Research Foundation Niels Bohr professorship project, Aarhus University Research on the Anthropocene (AURA)","Funding for fieldwork and writing was provided by the Danish National Research Foundation Niels Bohr professorship project, Aarhus University Research on the Anthropocene (AURA).

We examined the flight decisions Of Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) rising an approaching human whose speed, directness of approach, directness of gaze, and simulated gun carrying varied. Deer fled at: greater distances when approached more quickly and directly, and there was a concave-down quadrati c trend in the relationship between the distances at which the predator began its approach and at which the deer became alert (alert distance [AD]), indicating that, deer have a zone of awareness beyond which there is a delay in detecting art approaching predator. Time spent assessing the approacher (assessment time) was shorter during faster approaches and was positively related with A.D. Deer fled at longer distances and had shorter assessment dines when they were already alert to the predator at the initiation of approach. Males fled at shorter distances than females when approached during the gun-holding condition, and males had shorter assessment. times than females when the approacher averted his gaze.

Understanding risk perception in wildlife can allow mitigation of anthropogenic risk, with benefits to long-term animal fitness. Areas where animals choose to rest should minimize risk from predators, which for large carnivores typically equate to humans. We hypothesize that high human activity leads to selection for habitat security, whereas low activity enables trading security for forage. We investigated selection of resting (bedding) sites by GPS radiocollared adult grizzly bears (n = 10) in a low density population on a multiple-use landscape in Canada. We compared security and foods at resting and random locations while accounting for land use, season, and time of day. On reclaimed mines with low human access, bears selected high horizontal cover far from trails, but did not avoid open (herbaceous) areas, resting primarily at night. In protected areas bears also bedded at night, in areas with berry shrubs and Hedysarum spp., with horizontal cover selected in the summer, during high human access. On public lands with substantial human recreation, bears bedded at day, selected resting sites with high horizontal cover in the summer and habitat edges, with bedding associated with herbaceous foods. These spatial and temporal patterns of selection suggest that bears perceive human-related risk differentially in relation to human activity level, season and time of day, and employ a security-food trade-off strategy. Although grizzly bears are presently not hunted in Alberta, their perceived risks associated with humans influence resting-site selection.","[Cristescu, Bogdan; Boyce, Mark S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Stenhouse, Gordon B.] Foothills Res Inst, Grizzly Bear Program, Hinton, AB, Canada",,"Cristescu, B (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",cristesc@ualberta.ca,"Boyce, Mark S/A-2620-2014","Boyce, Mark S/0000-0001-5811-325X; Cristescu, Bogdan/0000-0003-2964-5040",Alberta Conservation Association,"This study was supported financially by: 1.

In non-human species females and, or their cues can also increase male risk taking. Under the ecologically relevant condition of predation threat, brief exposure of male mice to the odors of a sexually receptive novel female reduces the avoidance of, and aversive responses to, a predator. We briefly review evidence showing that estrogen receptors (ERs), ER alpha and ER beta, are associated with the mediation of these risk taking responses. We show that ERs influence the production of the female odors that affect male risk taking, with the odors of wild type (ER alpha WT, ER beta WT), oxytocin (OT) wildtype (OTWT), gene-deleted 'knock-out' ER ER beta (ER beta KO), but not ER beta KO or oxytocin (OT) OTKO or ovariectomized (OVX) female mice reducing the avoidance responses of male mice to cat odor. We further show that administration of specific ER alpha and ER beta agonists to OVX females results in their odors increasing male risk taking and boldness towards a predator. We also review evidence that ERs are involved in the mediation of the responses of males to female cues, with ER alpha being associated with the sexual and both ER beta and ER alpha with the sexual and social mechanisms underlying the effects of female cues on male risk taking.

However, research is needed to evaluate how human predation risk influences observability (a surrogate to harvest susceptibility) of ungulates. We determined how hunting intensity and duration influence observation rates of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and how deer behavior (i.e., movement rate and resource selection) affects observation rates. We sampled 37 adult (>= 2 yr) male deer at 2 levels of risk (i.e., low-risk = 1 hunter/101 ha; and high-risk = 1 hunter/30 ha) during 3 exposure periods (i.e., first, second, and third weekend of hunting) on a 1,861-ha property in Oklahoma, USA, during the 2008 and 2009 rifle deer-seasons. Observation rates (collared deer/hunter-hr/day) were greatest during the first weekend in both the low-and high-risk treatments, but declined each weekend thereafter in both treatments. Immediately prior to hunter observation, movement rate of observed collared deer was greater than that of unobserved collared deer, but only when hunting risk was high. Greater movement rates of deer in the high-risk treatment also led to a greater probability of observation. Hunters also had a greater probability of observing collared deer at higher elevations. Overall, deer modified their behavior to avoid detection by hunters. These results can be used to explain decreased observation rates to hunters and to modify harvest rates by altering timing and intensity of human predation risk during the recreational hunting season to help achieve population management goals through harvest.

Most prominently, glia-derived TNF-alpha has been shown to regulate homeostatic synaptic scaling [3-6], but TNF-alpha-null mice exhibited no apparent cognitive or emotional abnormalities. Instead, we found a TNF-alpha-dependent intergenerational effect, as mothers with a deficit in TNF-alpha programmed their offspring to exhibit low innate fear. Cross-fostering and conditional knockout experiments indicated that a TNF-alpha deficit in the maternal brain, rather than in the hematopoietic system, and during gestation was responsible for the low-fear offspring phenotype. The level of innate fear governs the balance between exploration/foraging and avoidance of predators and is thus fundamentally important in adaptation, fitness, and survival [7]. Because maternal exercise and activity are known to reduce both brain TNF-alpha [8] and offspring innate fear [9], whereas maternal stress has been reported to increase brain TNF-alpha [10] and offspring fear and anxiety [11, 12], maternal brain TNF-alpha may report environmental conditions to promote offspring behavioral adaptation to their anticipated postnatal environment.","[Zupan, Bojana; Liu, Bingfang; Taki, Faten; Toth, Judit Gal; Toth, Miklos] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Zupan, Bojana] Vassar Coll, Psychol Sci Dept, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA",,"Toth, M (corresponding author), Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Pharmacol, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",mtoth@med.cornell.edu,,,US National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1RO1MH080194]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH080194] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,We thank Sergei Nedospasov for providing us the floxed TNF-a mouse strain.

Recent research efforts have yielded controversial results based on short-term measures of stress, without exploring its fitness effects. We measured feather corticosterone (CORTf, reflecting the duration and amplitude of glucocorticoid secretion over several weeks) and subsequent annual survival in urban and rural burrowing owls. This species shows high individual consistency in fear of humans (i.e., flight initiation distance, FID), allowing us to hypothesize that individuals distribute among habitats according to their tolerance to human disturbance. FIDs were shorter in urban than in rural birds, but CORTf levels did not differ, nor were correlated to FIDs. Survival was twice as high in urban as in rural birds and links with CORTf varied between habitats: while a quadratic relationship supports stabilizing selection in urban birds, high predation rates may have masked CORTf-survival relationship in rural ones. These results evidence that urban life does not constitute an additional source of stress for urban individuals, as shown by their near identical CORTf values compared with rural conspecifics supporting the non-random distribution of individuals among habitats according to their behavioural phenotypes.","[Rebolo-Ifran, Natalia] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rebolo-Ifran, Natalia] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, IEGEBA CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Carrete, Martina] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Seville, Spain; [Carrete, Martina; Sanz-Aguilar, Ana; Cabezas, Sonia; Tella, Jose L.] CSIC Sevilla, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville, Spain; [Sanz-Aguilar, Ana] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, E-07190 Esporles, Islas Baleares, Spain; [Rodriguez-Martinez, Sol] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Biol Biochem & Pharm, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Marchant, Tracy A.; Bortolotti, Gary R.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada",,"Carrete, M (corresponding author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Seville, Spain.",martina@ebd.csic.es,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014; Sanz-Aguilar, Ana/D-3778-2014; Carrete, Martina/D-2618-2017; Carrete, Martina/A-6376-2009","Sanz-Aguilar, Ana/0000-0002-4177-9749; Cabezas, Sonia/0000-0001-8626-9518; Rodriguez-Martinez, Sol/0000-0002-7537-6753; Carrete, Martina/0000-0002-0491-2950",MECEuropean Commission [CGL2012-31888]; CSIC (Spain) [COOPA20049]; Canal Sur TV; Fundacion Repsol; CONICET (Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Ramon y Cajal contractSpanish Government [RYC-2009-04860];  [JCI-2011-09085],"We thank N.

While it is understood that, in the absence of humans, variation in animal behaviour can have cascading effects on species interactions, community structure and ecosystem function, we know little about whether the type or magnitude of human-induced behavioural shifts translate into detectable ecological change. Here we synthesise empirical literature and theory to create a novel framework for examining the range of behaviourally mediated pathways through which human activities may affect different ecosystem functions. We highlight the few empirical studies that show the potential realisation of some of these pathways, but also identify numerous factors that can dampen or prevent ultimate ecosystem consequences. Without a deeper understanding of these pathways, we risk wasting valuable resources on mitigating behavioural effects with little ecological relevance, or conversely mismanaging situations in which behavioural effects do drive ecosystem change. The framework presented here can be used to anticipate the nature and likelihood of ecological outcomes and prioritise management among widespread human-induced behavioural shifts, while also suggesting key priorities for future research linking humans, animal behaviour and ecology.","[Wilson, Margaret W.; Gaines, Steven D.; Halpern, Benjamin S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Ridlon, April D.; Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Halpern, Benjamin S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Stier, Adrian C.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Wilson, MW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",mwwilso-n@ucsb.edu,,"Gaines, Steven/0000-0002-7604-3483; Ridlon, April/0000-0002-4618-9908; Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); Schmidt Science Fellows; Rhodes Trust,"We thank Owen Liu, Dan Ovando and Karly Miller for their feedback on the initial framework structure and early manuscript conceptualisation, and we thank Mike Gil and two anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments.

We applied the giving-up density (GUD) method to quantify patch use behavior of the two species with respect to distance from shelter. Our results indicated that Spanish Sparrows perceived a steep gradient of increased predation cost with increasing distance from shelter, while House Sparrows seemed indifferent to distance from shelter. These results support the hypothesis that the cost of predation has less effect on the foraging behavior of urban than nonurban birds, although alternative explanations include differences between species in the degree of neophobia, or variations in their ability to assess predation risk.","[Tsurim, Ido; Abramsky, Zvika] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel",,"Tsurim, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",tsurim@bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,37,9,10,3,68,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,NOV,2008,110,4,,,,,772,776,,10.1525/cond.2008.8572,,,5,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,393PQ,WOS:000262385600019,,Green Published,,,2022-04-19,

This theory should apply even when organisms are habituated to disturbance, and how animals respond to human presence is likely to determine their success exploiting urban habitats. Therefore, urban animals should be sensitive to cues that inform them about levels of risk, allowing them to reduce costs by not overreacting to innocuous stimuli, while ensuring that they are nevertheless reactive to genuinely threatening stimuli. We tested this at a highly urbanized site in New York City, where eastern grey squirrels appear to pay little attention to humans. Squirrels were approached tangentially on a trajectory that took the observer within similar to 2 m of them and we measured alert distance, flight initiation distance (FID), and distance fled for each focal individual. Squirrels showed little sign of being alerted to the pedestrian if he remained on the footpath and did not look at them (only 5% of individuals moved away), but 90% of squirrels moved away, with longer FID and flight distance, when approached by a pedestrian that moved off the footpaths and looked at them. Squirrels therefore modulate their reactions when pedestrians behave in a predictable manner (i.e. remaining on the footpaths) and are also sensitive to the direction of attention of humans, reducing unnecessary responses, and are thereby likely to be increasing their ability to persist in this urban environment. Previous studies have emphasized the behavioural plasticity of successful urban wildlife species. In this study, we emphasize the importance of disturbance monitoring by successful urban exploiters, allowing them to vary their behavioural responses according to the level of risk to which they are exposed.","[Bateman, P.

Ethological studies suggest that sensitivity to risk in animals has evolved to maximize their Darwinian fitness, which includes optimizing their probability of survival and reproduction, among other considerations. Concomitantly, natural selection has shaped the neural circuitry underlying risky decision making, and recent evidence suggests that risk may be explicitly represented in the brain. Neurons in monkey posterior cingulate cortex show sensitivity to risk during a decision-making task, whereas dopaminergic neurons appear to reflect the degree of reward uncertainty. While such studies bear direct relevance to human neurobiology, it is highly likely that human behavior toward risk was also shaped by evolutionarily recent neural specializations, such as the von Economo neurons. For this reason, both animal and human studies are necessary to reveal the neural mechanisms that underlie risky decision making.","Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,"Watson, KK (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurobiol, Box 3209, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",karlikiiko@gmail.com,,"WATSON, KARLI/0000-0002-5513-1492",,,,36,9,9,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0077-8923,,978-1-57331-681-1,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2008,1128,,,,,,8,12,,10.1196/annals.1399.002,,,5,Behavioral Sciences; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Statistics & Probability,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology; Mathematics,BHR84,WOS:000255835600003,18469209,,,,2022-04-19,

Anthropogenic landscape modification, or human footprint, is well documented as a central cause of large mammal decline and range contractions where the proximal mechanisms of decline are often contentious. Direct mortality is an obvious cause; alternatively, human-modified landscapes perceived as unsuitable by some species may contribute to shifts in space use through preferential habitat selection. A useful approach to tease these effects apart is to determine whether behaviors potentially associated with risk vary with human footprint. We hypothesized wolverine (Gulo gulo) behaviors vary with different degrees of human footprint. We quantified metrics of behavior, which we assumed to indicate risk perception, from photographic images from a large existing camera-trapping dataset collected to understand wolverine distribution in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We systematically deployed 164 camera sites across three study areas covering approximately 24,000 km 2, sampled monthly between December and April (2007-2013). Wolverine behavior varied markedly across the study areas. Variation in behavior decreased with increasing human footprint. Increasing human footprint may constrain potential variation in behavior, through either restricting behavioral plasticity or individual variation in areas of high human impact. We hypothesize that behavioral constraints may indicate an increase in perceived risk in human-modified landscapes. Although survival is obviously a key contributor to species population decline and range loss, behavior may also make a significant contribution.","[Stewart, Frances E.

This study compared the risks imposed by humans and lynx on ungulate foraging behavior by examining the effects of browsing intensity (at two spatial scales), diet quality, and tree species selection. We hypothesized that: (1) in areas with high risk imposed by humans and lynx browsing intensity would be reduced; (2) risk effects would interact with habitat visibility at a fine scale, resulting in contrasting browsing patterns in response to humans versus lynx risk; (3) ungulates compensate for the higher costs incurred in high-risk areas by switching to a higher diet quality, and (4) browse a higher proportion of more-preferred tree species. These hypotheses were tested by measuring browsing intensity along 48 transects located at different distances from human settlements within the hunted and nonhunted areas of the Bavarian Forest. Dung samples were collected and analyzed as a proxy of diet quality (C:N ratio, fiber). The spatial patterns of browsing intensity, diet quality, and tree species selection were then linked to lynx risk, hunting intensity, recreation intensity, and distance to human settlements. Our results showed that (1) browsing intensity strongly decreased with increasing recreational activities, whereas it increased with lynx risk; (2) only in close proximity to human settlements tree browsing was higher in dense habitats and (3) a higher diet quality was obtained. (4) We found a stronger avoidance of the less preferred tree species in high-hunting intensity areas. In conclusion, our results indicate that the risk effects of human activities outweigh those of a natural large carnivore. Thus, highlighting the importance of taking those activities into account in predicting the impacts of large carnivores on ungulates and their plant-food choices.","[van Beeck Calkoen, Suzanne T.

While numerous studies have examined predation risk and risk effects in recent decades, a lack of standardization in approaches has impeded progress in the field. We provide an overview of five major study design considerations involved in assessing predation risk and responses of prey in carnivore-ungulate systems, highlighting how different design choices can impact the strength and scope of inference. First, we stress the importance of distinguishing measures of predation risk (probability of being killed) from measures of risk effects (costs of antipredator behaviors in response to risk). Second, we recommend explicit consideration of spatial and temporal scales using a standardized framework to facilitate cross-study comparisons. Third, ungulates use visual, auditory, and olfactory sensory pathways to evaluate predation risk. Experiments that manipulate signals of risk (e.g., auditory playbacks or application of predator scent) can be powerful approaches, but the dosages and types of cues need to be carefully considered. Fourth, ungulates usually face threats from multiple predators simultaneously, and we highlight the potential for remote cameras and structural equation modeling to help address this challenge. Fifth, emerging technologies may substantially improve our ability to assess risk. We discuss several promising technologies, such as animal-borne video, unmanned aerial vehicles, and physiological sensors. We conclude with general recommendations for study design, which may improve the utility of predation risk research for the conservation and management of carnivore-ungulate systems.","[Prugh, Laura R.; Sivy, Kelly J.; Mahoney, Peter J.; Ganz, Taylor R.; van de Kerk, Madelon] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ditmer, Mark A.] Boise State Univ, Human Environm Syst, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Gilbert, Sophie L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Montgomery, Robert A.] Michigan State Univ, Res Ecol Carnivores & Their Prey RECaP Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Prugh, LR (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lprugh@uw.edu,"; Montgomery, Robert A./C-5541-2019","Gilbert, Sophie/0000-0002-9974-5146; Montgomery, Robert A./0000-0001-5894-0589","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1652420]; Arctic - Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE); NASA Terrestrial Ecology project [NNX15AU20A, NNX15AU21A]; Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife","This work was supported by grants to LRP from the National Science Foundation (DEB-1652420, support for LRP and KJS), the Arctic - Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), a NASA Terrestrial Ecology project (awards NNX15AU20A & NNX15AU21A, support for PJM & MvdK, respectively), and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (support for TRG).",,229,24,24,11,31,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

We also show that castration post establishment of chronic infection precludes changes in fear and medial amygdala arginine vasopressin in the infected male rats.

Regionally, we analyzed linear and nonlinear variation in breeding densities in relation to observed pedestrian rates in forest fragments. Locally, we tested experimentally the resource-use-disturbance tradeoff hypothesis, which suggests that an increase in the frequency of human visitation decreases the frequency of resource use by an animal, assuming that individuals react to humans as if they were potential predators, and that responses depend upon the probability of visually detecting humans. Breeding densities peaked at intermediate pedestrian rates in two consecutive years. Consumption rates of artificial food within fragments were higher at intermediate pedestrian rates, which may indicate that this species uses people as cues to find food. Consumption rates decreased at high pedestrian rates as a result of low tolerance to people and a reduction in the time devoted to foraging. Our results imply a balance between attraction to and avoidance of humans to account for these nonlinear responses, and that the resource-use-disturbance trade-off hypothesis can be a useful mechanistic explanation for understanding the responses to humans of species that may receive a direct or indirect benefit from human presence.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Grp Ecol Aplicada, Madrid 28040, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Bot, Fac Biol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,"Fernandez-Juricic, E (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 100 Ecol Bldg,1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",estebanfj@yahoo.com,,,,,,46,38,39,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,MAY,2003,105,2,,,,,316,326,,10.1650/0010-5422(2003)105[0316:TTRHIA]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,674YF,WOS:000182664700012,,,,,2022-04-19,

Hunting pressure increases the perception of predation risk in ungulates and hares and may force them to create clumped groups within protected areas. Acute effects are showed immediately after harassments and may include displacement of home ranges, alteration of activity rhythms and increased hormone secretions. No study has been carried out yet on behavioural alterations induced by hunting on non-target, legally protected species, whereas these studies should be required to design addressed management and conservation plans. The crested porcupine Hystrix cristata represents a suitable model species to study effects of hunting on protected species, as its ranging movements and activity rhythms are seasonally, stereotypically repeated. My results on individually marked porcupines showed that, when hunting with dogs occurred, a displacement of home range arises towards areas providing easily accessible food resources (i.e. fruits, which do not require digging). This behaviour might prevent porcupines to spend a high amount of time digging bulbs and tubers and, thus, it may result in a reduction of activity bouts. Home range displacement has also been observed only when > 10 cm of snow are present on the ground. The presence of hunting dogs increases the predation risk perception by potential prey species, which in turn respond by altering their spatio-temporal behaviour. Wildlife managers should therefore evaluate the use of a small number of specialized dogs for hunting in management and conservation plans, particularly in areas characterized by the presence of endangered and protected species.","[Mori, Emiliano] Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli,4, I-53100 Siena, Italy",,"Mori, E (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dipartimento Sci Vita, Via PA Mattioli,4, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",moriemiliano@tiscali.it,"Mori, Emiliano/AAA-8803-2022","Mori, Emiliano/0000-0001-8108-7950",,,,68,12,12,0,40,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2199-2401,2199-241X,,MAMMAL RES,Mammal Res.,JUL,2017,62,3,,,,,251,258,,10.1007/s13364-017-0313-5,,,8,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,EY1FX,WOS:000403712300005,,,,,2022-04-19,

Different factors (human impact and habitat characteristics) likely to modify anti-predator behaviour in different types of guanaco social groups were analysed. We found that group size was conditioned by high poaching, vehicle traffic, predation risk and vegetation density. Solitary adult males showed shorter alert and flight initiation distances than bachelor and mixed groups. Alert distance was greater during the summer season, and assessment times were shorter when young were present in the groups. In high-predation-risk environments, guanacos detected threats at greater distances and flight initiation distance was longer. Alert distances were shorter on steeper sloped hills and assessment times were shorter in areas with irregular topography than on flat sites. In high traffic areas, flight initiation distance was longer and assessment times were shorter. And in areas with low poaching intensity, assessment times were greater than in those with high poaching levels. Therefore, guanacos may be able to evaluate a true threat. Social group and anti-predator responses were conditioned by habitat characteristics and human impact. We consider that plasticity of responses could be key to the survival of guanacos.","[Taraborelli, P.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT Mendoza, IADIZA, Lab Desertificac & Ordenamiento Terr LaDyOT, Mendoza, Argentina; [Taraborelli, P.; Ovejero, R.; Schroeder, N.

We assessed the response of eight species (African elephant, Maasai giraffe, plains zebra, common wildebeest, Grant's gazelle, impala, Thomson's gazelle and Kirk's dik dik) towards human observers in a landscape with variable anthropogenic hunting pressure. Using logistic regressions, we tested the effect of habitat type, group size, distance to observer and conservation status of the area on the likelihood of animal behavioural adjustments (walking away, fleeing or giving alarm calls). Habitat type did not affect the likelihood of a response towards humans. Dik diks were less likely to respond towards human when they were in larger groups. In contrast, zebras and Thomson's gazelles were marginally significantly more likely to show a response when in larger groups. Responses of all species were significantly or marginally significantly (elephant) lower with increasing distance from observers (an increase by one meter distance changed the response likelihood by 0.01-0.30). Four species (zebra, wildebeest, impala, dik dik) showed a gradual adjustment of responsiveness according to conservation status and were most responsive in non-protected and least responsive in fully protected areas (0.02-0.29 times less responsive in fully vs. multiple-use areas). However, elephants, giraffes and both gazelle species did not significantly adjust their behaviour according to conservation status. This suggests that the behaviour of some species can be used as useful indicator of conservation status of an area whereas the behaviour of other species does not allow discriminating between management types. More generally, our study highlights the importance of assessing and controlling illegal hunting in multiple-use areas and suggests a stronger consideration of human-induced risk effects in the conservation of ungulates.","[Kiffner, C.; Kioko, J.; Kissui, B.] Ctr Wildlife Management Studies, Sch Field Studies, Karatu, Tanzania; [Painter, C.] Univ Redlands, Redlands, CA 92373 USA; [Serota, M.] Connecticut Coll, New London, CT 06320 USA; [White, C.] Unity Coll, Unity, ME USA; [Yager, P.] Framingham State Univ, Framingham, MA USA",,"Kiffner, C (corresponding author), Ctr Wildlife Management Studies, Sch Field Studies, POB 304, Karatu, Tanzania.",ckiffne@gwdg.de,"Kiffner, Christian/F-4088-2012","Kiffner, Christian/0000-0002-7475-9023",,,,61,27,27,2,126,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-9430,1469-1795,,ANIM CONSERV,Anim.

These behavioral shifts may be an adaptive response to urbanization, but it may be costly if animals in urban areas also exhibit reduced anti-predator behavior in the presence of natural predators. In trials with only a human observer as the stimulus, urban squirrels exhibited reduced vigilance and anti-predator behavior compared to those in less urban areas. Next, we exposed squirrels in multiple urban and less urban sites to acoustic playbacks of a control stimulus (non-predatory bird calls), a natural predator (hawk), and dogs and recorded their vigilance and three different anti-predator behaviors when a human approached them while either broadcasting one of these three playbacks or no playbacks at all. Squirrels at urban sites also did not differ in their behavioral responses to the playbacks from possible predators (hawks or dogs) when they were compared to those at less urban sites exposed to these playbacks. Urban squirrels also exhibited increased vigilance and anti-predator behavior when exposed to a human paired with hawk playbacks compared to the control playbacks. Together, our results indicate that urban squirrels did perceive and assess risk to the natural predator appropriately despite exhibiting increased tolerance to humans. These results provide little support for the hypothesis that increased tolerance to humans causes animals to lose their fear of natural predators.","[Kittendorf, Anna; Dantzer, Ben] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dantzer, Ben] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Dantzer, B (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",dantzer@umich.edu,"Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011","Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X",University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System,University of Michigan,,75,0,0,15,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,SEP,2021,127,9,,,,,697,709,,10.1111/eth.13206,,JUL 2021,13,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,TW9NO,WOS:000668854600001,,,,,2022-04-19,

By using deer census data, possible correlations were analyzed between the increase in human presence and the response of. each age and sex class. The numbers of different age and sex classes of deer recorded inside and outside the sector affected by human presence throughout the 20-year period of study were compared. A differential response was recorded among classes. Adult females and juveniles left this area (reducing their presence from 37% of all deer observed to 11% for adult females and from 19% to 3% for juveniles) when human pressure became higher, whereas the opposite result was true for males older than 24 months (adult males) that remained inside the disturbed sector (from 27% to 50% of deer observed). Intermediate values were recorded for yearling males, because they can be associated with both groups of females and groups of males. Results Of this long-term study are best explained with the reproductive strategy hypothesis, because the increase of predation risk evoked a marked spatial Sexual segregation in the fallow deer population. Females and juveniles used relatively predator-safe habitats, whereas males used habitats with higher predation risk but better food quality. Furthermore, as females increased their presence outside the disturbed sector, males gradually abandoned the undisturbed area, increased use of the disturbed sector, and maximized foraging opportunities by going to areas where indirect competition with females was probably reduced.","Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Zool & Antropol Biol, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",,"Apollonio, M (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Zool & Antropol Biol, Via Muroni 25, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",marcoapo@uniss.it,"Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013","Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509",,,,58,24,25,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

Understanding specific responses to disturbances can help conservation management better protect wildlife populations to coexist with local communities. Here, we studied the response of a model ungulate species, the impala (Aepyceros melampus), to different types of human activities in the Serengeti ecosystem. Impala were studied in central Serengeti National Park (CSNP), an area with relatively low human disturbance, and, with increasing levels of human disturbance, in western Serengeti National Park (WSNP), Grumeti Game Reserve (GGR), Ikona Wildlife Management Area (IWMA), and Loliondo Game Controlled Area (LGCA); pastoralism and/or hunting are the main disturbances in these areas. We hypothesised that in the exploited GGR, IWMA and LGCA areas, 1) impala would spend more time on costly behaviours, 2) sex ratios would be more female skewed, and 3) group sizes, reproduction and recruitment ratios would be lower compared to CSNP. We found that impala spent less time resting in IWMA and LGCA, as well as a significantly lower proportion of males, and lower reproduction and recruitment ratios in LGCA. Impala synchronized their behaviour, increasing their social cohesion potentially resulting in more efficient anti-predator strategies. Human activities induced a behavioural response in impala, indicating that in less regulated areas where pastoralism and hunting are allowed, these disturbances can potentially affect impala population persistence. These results highlight the importance of protected areas for wildlife populations, and the need for continuous monitoring of the impala and other ungulate populations in less regulated areas, as the underlying anthropogenic disturbances are likely impacting diverse species.

In African savannas, human-mediated changes to woody cover affect perceptions of risk and foraging decisions by large herbivores. Through cafeteria-style feeding trials, we presented two common, browsing ungulates (Guenther's dik-dik [Madoqua guentheri] and impala [Aepyceros melampus]) with branches from four tree species that varied in their relative investment in mechanical and chemical defenses. We conducted trials in habitats that were perceived as risky to either dik-dik (i.e., open habitat) or impala (i.e., bushland habitat). We found that dik-dik preferred to eat thorny trees low in tannin content within bushland habitats, while the larger-bodied impala preferred tannin-rich but thorn-less branches within open habitats. Risk-induced habitat use homogenized browsing pressure in the lower canopy, but increased heterogeneity in browsing pressure in the upper canopy.

We presented spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) from two populations, each exposed to a different level of human activity, with a life-size model hyena representing an intruder from another clan. The high-disturbance population lived adjacent to human settlements, and the low-disturbance population inhabited a relatively undisturbed part of the same national park in Kenya. The mock intruder was presented to individual hyenas to assess their reactions to an alien hyena, and to determine whether their reactions varied with their exposure to anthropogenic activity. We found that human disturbance was indeed associated with hyena risk-taking behavior in response to the model intruder. Hyenas tested in the low-disturbance area exhibited more risk-taking behaviors by approaching the mock intruder more closely, and spending more time near it, than did their counterparts living in high-disturbance areas. Hyenas that spent less time in close proximity to the model had greater survivorship than those that spent more time in close proximity to it, regardless of disturbance level. Furthermore, the individual differences in risk-taking measured here were consistent with those obtained previously from the same animals using a different set of experimental manipulations. However, the experimentally induced behaviors were not consistent with naturally occurring risk-taking behaviors in proximity to lions; this suggests that risk-taking behaviors are consistent within individuals across experimental contexts, but that exposure to lions elicits different responses. Although our results are consistent with those from earlier tests of anthropogenic disturbance and boldness in spotted hyenas and other predators, they differ from results obtained from birds and small mammals, which are generally found to be bolder in areas characterized by human disturbance.","[Turner, Julie W.; LaFleur, Rebecca M.; Richardson, Allie T.; Holekamp, Kay E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 288 Farm Ln Rm 203, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Turner, Julie W.; Holekamp, Kay E.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Turner, Julie W.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF, Canada",,"Turner, JW (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, 288 Farm Ln Rm 203, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",julwturner@gmail.com,"Turner, Julie W./AAN-5068-2020","Turner, Julie W./0000-0001-5449-5449; Holekamp, Kay/0000-0001-5471-1076","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1353110, OISE1556407, OISE1853934, IOS1755089]; Animal Behavior Society; American Society of Mammalogists; College of Natural Science at Michigan State University","This research was supported by National Science Foundation Grants DEB1353110, OISE1556407, OISE1853934, and IOS1755089 to KEH, a Student Research Grant from the Animal Behavior Society to JWT, a Grant-in-Aid from the American Society of Mammalogists to JWT, and a Dissertation Continuation Fellowship to JWT from the College of Natural Science at Michigan State University.",,71,2,2,3,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JAN,2020,126,1,,,,,97,110,,10.1111/eth.12964,,,14,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,LW8VZ,WOS:000539422800011,,Bronze,,,2022-04-19,

The zebrafish has been proposed as an in vivo tool for the analysis of vertebrate fear responses as well as human psychopathological conditions such as anxiety. We have been developing behavioral tasks for zebrafish that could be utilized for screening mutation or drug induced changes in fear responses. In this paper we present a modified version of a previously developed predator avoidance paradigm that now allows the induction and quantification of avoidance reactions that we previously could not elicit. Most importantly, in the current paradigm zebrafish are now shown to respond to the appearance of a moving image of a sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish, by increasing their distance from the image, a robust reaction that is easy to quantify in an automated manner. Unexpectedly, however, another fear response, the diving response, was seen robustly only at the beginning of the test but not in response to the predator stimulus. We discuss the implications of these results and conclude that although zebrafish fear responses are complex and context dependent, the current paradigm is a significant step towards high throughput screening for alterations in fear responses of zebrafish.

Hence, they should optimise their escape strategy under the risk of predation, and flee at a distance, referred to as flight initiation distance (FID), when the fitness-related benefits of staying are balanced against the costs of escape. However, there is an absence of FID studies in primates. In this study, we used vervet monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus, a medium-sized African cercopithecoid, as a model species to investigate the influence of environment type (urban and rural), group size (defined as the number of visible neighbours), sex and age on FID when approached by a human. We found significantly shorter FID among urban than rural monkeys; urban individuals delayed their escape compared to rural individuals. We found no relationship between FID and sex and age class, but FID was positively correlated with group size in both settings; urban monkeys live in smaller groups than monkeys in rural areas. As FID and group size are important predictors of predation risk perception in primates, results suggest that, despite probable effects of habituation, vervet monkeys in Uganda adjust their antipredator behaviour when coping with novel environments within human settlements. Our findings are consistent with some previous studies of risk perception in animals, and indicate that FID could be used as an alternative measure for predation risk in primates.","[Mikula, Peter] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Saffa, Gabriel] Univ Presov, Dept Ecol, Lab & Museum Evolutionary Ecol, 17 Novembra 1, Presov 08001, Slovakia; [Nelson, Emma] Univ Liverpool, Sch Med, Fac Clin Sci, Liverpool L69 13 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Nelson, Emma] Univ Liverpool, Dept Archaeol Class & Egyptol, Liverpool L69 7WZ, Merseyside, England; [Tryjanowski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland",,"Mikula, P (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",petomikula158@gmail.com,"Mikula, Peter/I-3851-2016","Mikula, Peter/0000-0002-2731-9105; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-36098G],"We would like also to thank P.

Such circadian rhythms are vital to human mental health, but it is unknown whether circadian rhythms entrained to the LD cycle can be overridden by entrainment to daily recurring threats. We show that unsignaled nocturnal footshock caused rats living in an ethological apparatus to switch their natural foraging behavior from the dark to the light phase and that this switch was maintained as a free-running circadian rhythm upon removal of light cues and footshocks. Furthermore, this fear-entrained circadian behavior was dependent on an intact amygdala and suprachiasmatic nucleus. Thus, time-specific fear can act as a non-photic entraining stimulus for the circadian system, and limbic centers encoding aversive information are likely part of the circadian oscillator network that temporally organizes behavior.","[Pellman, Blake A.; Kim, Earnest; Reilly, Melissa; Kashima, James; Motch, Oleksiy; Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [de la Iglesia, Horacio O.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [de la Iglesia, Horacio O.; Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Program Neurosci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"de la Iglesia, HO (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",horaciod@u.washington.edu; jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH64457, MH099073]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH099073, R01MH064457] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Division Of Integrative Organismal SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1145796] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants MH64457 and MH099073 (J.J.K.).

The blanket culling strategy implicitly assumes that incident risk is directly correlated with shark density, an assumption that has yet to be demonstrated. We present the alternative hypothesis that incidents are more likely to be caused by behavioral variability among individual sharks than due to shark density. Throughout their ontogenetic development, large species of sharks opportunistically establish a diet that is rarely, if ever, inclusive of humans as a food source. We propose that, some animals with specific behaviors (including boldness) may potentially pose a higher risk than conspecifics. Under this scenario, the risk of a shark attack in a given area would relate to the presence of a limited number of high-risk individuals rather than shark density. In terms of management of human fatalities, such a hypothesis would favor abandoning general culling campaigns and replacing them with approaches that profile and selectively remove the potential problem individuals, as is done in the terrestrial realm when managing predators that attack humans or livestock.","[Clua, Eric E.

However, possible long-term habituation effects and re-use of experimental subjects need to be verified. This study, therefore, compared the behavioral response of experienced versus naive adult black tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix penicillata) in the MPCT, with/without diazepam administrations. Subjects were tested in the figure-8 maze and confronted with a taxidermized wild-cat predator stimulus. After four initial 20-min maze habituation sessions, each subject was submitted to two randomly-assigned 20-min predator confrontation sessions: vehicle and 2 mg/kg of diazepam. Confrontation with the predator induced significant behavioral changes; i.e., proximic avoidance and tsik-tsik alarm call. Diazepam administration, concomitant to predator exposure, reversed the behavioral changes observed. In both the experienced and naive marmosets a similar behavioral profile and response pattern to diazepam was detected, corroborating the important selective pressure that felines seem to have on marmoset behavioral ecology. Therefore, during a more naturalistic-like regimen i.e., recurring intermittent predator encounters - the general response pattern remains highly consistent, regardless of prior experience. One may consider the re-use of marmoset subjects in the MPCT, particularly under these specific conditions (i.e. repeated 20-min confrontations, 72-h apart). (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

For example, the predator's head and gaze orientation (direction of attention) may reveal its intentions, and faster-approaching predators are likely to represent greater risk. We examined the reactions of hadeda ibises Bostrychia hagedash. These large birds demonstrate a wide repertoire of responses to being approached (e. g. continuing to forage, slow walking, rapid escape walking, flight and alarm calling). Birds were approached tangentially 112 times by a human who either had the head and eyes directed towards (65 approaches) or directed away from (47 approaches) the birds to test the hypothesis that the direction of the observer's attention informs alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) in these birds. Direction of attention had a significant effect on AD and FID as well as the likelihood of taking flight and alarm calling by hadedas, with birds appearing to associate attention directed towards them as an indication of increased risk. Hadedas were able to differentiate between the direction of attention of an approaching human, whether or not there were multiple other humans in the near vicinity. We also examined whether the observer's approach speed altered the birds' responses. Approach speed affected the birds' FID, suggesting that they perceive greater danger in a faster-approaching intruder compared with a slower-walking one. These results support the predictions of optimal escape theory and emphasize the high resolution of antipredatory awareness in these birds. The marked success of hadeda ibises in urban environments may be due to their ability to become habituated to human presence and to modify their antipredator behaviour in response to subtle cues. These may be common traits of bird species that successfully adapt to urban environments.","[Bateman, P. W.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Bateman, P.

Behavioural and neurophysiological traits and responses associated with anxiety and predation-related fear have been well documented in rodent models. Certain parasites and pathogens which rely on predation for transmission appear able to manipulate these, often innate, traits to increase the likelihood of their life-cycle being completed. This can occur through a range of mechanisms, such as alteration of hormonal and neurotransmitter communication and/or direct interference with the neurons and brain regions that mediate behavioural expression. Whilst some post-infection behavioural changes may reflect 'general sickness' or a pathological by-product of infection, others may have a specific adaptive advantage to the parasite and be indicative of active manipulation of host behaviour. Here we review the key mechanisms by which anxiety and predation-related fears are controlled in mammals, before exploring evidence for how some infectious agents may manipulate these mechanisms. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is focused on as a prime example. Selective pressures appear to have allowed this parasite to evolve strategies to alter the behaviour in its natural intermediate rodent host. Latent infection has also been associated with a range of altered behavioural profiles, from subtle to severe, in other secondary host species including humans. In addition to enhancing our knowledge of the evolution of parasite manipulation in general, to further our understanding of how and when these potential changes to human host behaviour occur, and how we may prevent or manage them, it is imperative to elucidate the associated mechanisms involved.

Experiment 2 showed that pups reacted similarly to their mother and other adult rabbits. In Experiment 3, we used nonhandled control pups, and pups in the experimental groups were stimulated by either a human, a cat, or both. Only human-handled animals showed high affinity to approach a human at weaning. Similarly, only rabbit pups exposed to a cat did not show fear reaction towards a cat. Nonhandled controls avoided both the cat and the human, and rabbits stimulated by by both species did not avoid any of them at weaning. We demonstrated that handling affected the behavior of weaning rabbits in a selective manner, as they only approached those objects frequently to which they had been exposed to.

Dysfunction of early emotional circuits may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. However, how the functional circuits are formed to prime initial emotional behaviours remain elusive. We reveal here using gene-targeted mutations an essential role for ephrin-B3 ligand-like activity in the development of innate fear in the neonatal brain. We further demonstrate that ephrin-B3 controls axon targeting and coordinates spinogenesis and neuronal activity within the amygdala. The morphological and behavioural abnormalities in ephrin-B3 mutant mice are rescued by conditional knock-in of wild-type ephrin-B3 during the critical period when axon targeting and fear responses are initiated. Our results thus define a key axonal molecule that participates in the wiring of amygdala circuits and helps bring about fear emotion during the important adolescence period.","[Zhu, Xiao-Na; Sun, Suya] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Ruijin Hosp, Dept Neurol,Inst Neurol, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiao-Na; Liu, Xian-Dong; Xu, Nan-Jie] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Div Neurosci, Dept Anat Histol & Embryol, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiao-Na; Yang, Jing-Yu] Shenyang Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xian-Dong; Xu, Nan-Jie] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Cell Biol, Shanghai Key Lab Tumor Microenvironm & Inflammat, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Hanyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Inst Hlth Sci,Shanghai Inst Biol Sci, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Henkemeyer, Mark] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurosci, Kent Waldrep Ctr Basic Res Nerve Growth & Regener, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Henkemeyer, Mark] Univ Texas SW Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Dev Biol, Kent Waldrep Ctr Basic Res Nerve Growth & Regener, Dallas, TX 75390 USA",,"Sun, SY (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Ruijin Hosp, Dept Neurol,Inst Neurol, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.; Xu, NJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Div Neurosci, Dept Anat Histol & Embryol, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.; Xu, NJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Cell Biol, Shanghai Key Lab Tumor Microenvironm & Inflammat, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China.",sunsuya@shsmu.edu.cn; xunanjie@sjtu.edu.cn,"XU, Nan-Jie/AAJ-4363-2020; Xu, Nan-Jie/N-3391-2016","XU, Nan-Jie/0000-0003-2147-3352; Xu, Nan-Jie/0000-0003-2147-3352; , Jingyu Yang/0000-0002-2791-5281","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB965002]; National Natural and Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91232704, 31271160, 81471151, 81373383]; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning [2013-25]; Shanghai Committee of Science and TechnologyShanghai Science & Technology Committee [11DZ2260200]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH066332]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH066332] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Drs Haohong Li, Lan Bao, Xiang Yu and Jian Zhong for helpful comments on the manuscript, Joshua Sanes for Thy1-GFP-M transgenic mice, Hongkui Zeng and Jane E.

However, behavioral plasticity in response to perceived predation risk, and its potential fitness-related costs, are understudied. In a wild population of breeding house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), we tested the hypotheses that (1) birds show behavioral plasticity in response to perceived nest-predation risk to reduce self-risk or risk to offspring, but (2) this plasticity incurs fitness-related costs. We experimentally increased the perceived risk of nest predation by enlarging the diameter of the nestbox entrance from the standard 3.2 to 5.0 cm once incubation began. Unexpectedly, large-hole females spent significantly less time being vigilant than small-hole (control) females during late incubation. Both males and females also exhibited plasticity in their provisioning behavior. Large-hole males increased and large-hole females decreased provisioning visits with increasing brood size, whereas small-hole males and females behaved similarly and were unaffected by brood size. Females did not show plasticity in their incubation or brooding behavior. Notwithstanding this behavioral plasticity in response to increased perceived predation risk, treatment had no effect on hatching success or early hatchling survival, nor did it affect nestling body condition or fledging success. We conclude, therefore, that house wrens show behavioral plasticity in response to perceived nest-predation risk, but that any short-term fitness-related costs associated with this flexibility appear negligible.","[Dorset, Erin E.; Sakaluk, Scott K.; Thompson, Charles F.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA",,"Thompson, CF (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",wrens@ilstu.edu,,,National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R15HD076308-01]; Beta Lambda Chapter of the Phi Sigma Biological Honor Society; Illinois State University; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R15HD076308] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank the 2014 and 2015 Wren Crews for field support, and the ParkLands Foundation (Merwin Nature Preserve) for use of their property.

Using giving-up densities (GUDs) paired with camera traps, we examined the concurrent influence of chronic road noise and predation risk on free-living small mammals. Specifically, we looked for differences in foraging and vigilance behavior during various noise treatments. We found that small mammals significantly reduced food intake when exposed to predation risk; however, concurrent exposure to road noise eliminated this effect; small mammals increased food intake when exposed to road noise and risk compared to risk alone. Furthermore, road noise reduced the number of visits and time spent at foraging trays while it increased vigilance behavior of small mammals in risky situations, meaning they were able to increase their foraging efficiency. Mice also ate less when moon illumination was greater; however, this had no effect on our overall results. This is one of the first studies to concurrently examine the effects of road noise and predation risk on free-living prey. It shows the complex responses of prey exposed to chronic noise conditions as they attempt to gain reliable information about predation risk and respond appropriately. We highlight the potential consequences road noise may have on the survival of prey as it interferes with their appropriate risk responses.","[Giordano, A.; Sheriff, M.

Several studies have reported that administration of NMDA antagonists early in development can cause long-lasting changes in behavior. For example, Gould and Cameron [Behav Neurosci 111:49-56 (1997a)] have shown that a single injection of the competitive NMDA antagonist CGP 43487 on postnatal day (PD) 5 affected behavioral immobility in young rats exposed to the odor of a natural predator. Objectives: This experiment was undertaken to determine whether the behavioral effects previously reported would also be seen with conditioned cues. Both stimulus-elicited behavioral immobility (freezing) and changes in heart rate were recorded to examine impairments in responding across multiple measures. Methods: Animals were given a single injection of 0, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg CGP 43487 on PD 5. On PD 20 subjects were given paired or unpaired presentations of either an olfactory or auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) with a 110-dB-white-noise unconditioned stimulus. CS-elicited freezing and changes in heart rate were measured. Results: Pups treated with CGP exhibited impairments in conditioned freezing, but were unaffected in their expression of conditioned changes in heart rate, to both olfactory and auditory stimuli. Conclusions: These results indicate that neonatal treatment with an NMDA antagonist affects the expression of fear in a response-specific manner. The data suggest that antagonist-induced alterations in neural systems involved in the expression of freezing are affected by NMDA receptor blockade early in life.","Coll William & Mary, Dept Psychol, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",,"Hunt, PS (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Dept Psychol, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",pshunt@wm.edu,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA015343, R01AA012466] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [AA12466, AA015343] Funding Source: Medline",,,63,6,6,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,APR,2006,185,2,,,,,179,187,,10.1007/s00213-005-0291-1,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,020MR,WOS:000235914100006,16416331,,,,2022-04-19,

The time taken for waders to return to nests depends on numerous factors that affect the costs and benefits of incubation and anti-predator behavior. Understanding this trade-off may help assess the reproductive consequences of different nest return times and identify variables to consider in breeding disturbance studies. We subjected 73 Malaysian plover (Charadrius peronii) nests to standardized human disturbances and an analysis of covariance was used to determine how weather, time of day, embryonic age, weeks into breeding season and nest attendance (proportion of time adults incubated nests) influence nest return times. Egg temperatures were estimated using a regression model that predicted the temperature inside unshaded eggs from air temperature, cloud cover and time of day (r(2) = 0.88). We assessed the relationship between nest return times and hatch success. Plovers returned to nests faster at higher modeled egg temperature (P = 0.010), in the morning (P = 0.003), if they had younger clutches (P = 0.038), and if they had high nest attendance prior to the disturbance (P = 0.015). Pairs that returned to nests faster had lower hatch success (P = 0.021). This may be because pairs that spend more time distracting humans may also do so for predators. These results suggest that short nest return times may not indicate low fitness costs of disturbance. The thermal and predation environment in addition to nest return times should be taken into account when assessing the deleterious effects of human disturbance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Studying its behavior will add to the already strong knowledge of, its biology and will strengthen the use of this species in behavior genetics and neuroscience. Anxiety is one of the most problematic human psychiatric conditions. Arguably, it arises as a result of abnormally exaggerated natural fear responses. The zebrafish may be an appropriate model to investigate the biology of fear and anxiety. Fear responses are expressed by animals when exposed to predators, and these responses can be learned or innate. Here we investigated whether zebrafish respond differentially to a natural predator or other fish species upon their first exposure to these fish. Naive zebrafish were shown four species of fish chosen based on predatory status (predatory or harmless) and geographical origin (allopatric or sympatric). Our results suggest that na:ive zebrafish respond differentially to the stimulus fish. Particularly interesting is the antipredatory response elicited by the zebrafish's sympatric predator, the Indian Leaf Fish, and the fact that this latter species exhibited almost no predatory attacks. The findings obtained open a new avenue of research into what zebrafish perceive as dangerous or fear inducing. They will also allow us to develop fear and anxiety related behavioral test methods with which the contribution of genes to, or the effects of novel anxiolytic substances on these behaviors may be analyzed.

An emerging field in applied ecology involves behavioral avoidance of or attraction to humans and their trappings. We posit trophic consequences, in terms of relative risk, for four species of mammals, each of which strongly avoids human activity, in urban reserves of coastal southern California. Two species, one predator and one prey, avoid human activity via a temporal shift to become more nocturnal-the species' activity is centered near dawn on days without human activity but nearer to midnight on days with human activity. Diel shifts have brought the species into greater overlap, respectively, with a key prey and a key predator, overlap that may increase encounter rate and thus increase relative risk of predation, with potential consequences for trophic dynamics and cascades: increased risk of predation may depress prey population, either directly (e.g., mortality) or indirectly (e.g., landscape of fear). Human use of reserves, especially in high population density regions, needs to be reconsidered either to reduce access or to restrict access entirely to areas that may provide refuge to both predators and prey.","[Patten, Michael A.] Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Patten, Michael A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Burger, Jutta C.] Irvine Ranch Conservancy, Irvine, CA USA; [Mitrovich, Milan] Nat Communities Coalit, Irvine, CA USA; [Burger, Jutta C.] Calif Native Plant Soc, Berkeley, CA USA",,"Patten, MA (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA.; Patten, MA (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",mpatten@ou.edu,,"Mitrovich, Milan/0000-0001-6053-1143",California Department of Fish and Wildlife [P1482109],"This work was funded by Local Assistance Grant #P1482109 awarded by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Planning/NCCP/Grants The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,46,4,4,3,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,DEC 13,2019,14,12,,,,,,,e0226418,10.1371/journal.pone.0226418,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LP3QF,WOS:000534232900035,31834919,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-04-19,

It has been reported that predator odor and calls can drive away rodents, but little is known about species-specific responses of prey. For these reasons, we compared the behavioral changes of common rodent species inhabiting the Chilean temperate forest (Abrothrix spp., the long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and the black rat Rattus rattus) when exposed to two different native predator calls (the austral pygmy owl Glaucidium nana and the rufous-legged owl Strix rufipes) and a control (no predator calls). Our results showed that all rodent species modified their behavior in the presence of predator calls, but the effects were species dependent. These findings point to the need to carefully study target rodent species instead of applying a general control plan for all rodent species. Ecologically based rodent management strategies are arising as a sustainable approach to rodent control, allowing us to preserve biodiversity while safeguarding human economic activities. Despite predator signals being known to generally repel rodents, few field-based studies have compared the behavioral effects of several predators on different prey species, especially in Neotropical ecosystems. Here, we used camera traps to study the behavior of rodent species native to the Chilean temperate forest (Abrothrix spp., long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and an introduced rodent (black rat Rattus rattus). Using playbacks of raptor calls, we experimentally exposed rodents to three predation risk treatments: austral pygmy owl calls (Glaucidium nana), rufous-legged owl calls (Strix rufipes) and a control treatment (absence of owl calls). We evaluated the effects of the treatments on the time allocated to three behaviors: feeding time, locomotor activity and vigilance. Moonlight and vegetation cover were also considered in the analyses, as they can modify perceived predation risk. Results showed that predator calls and environmental factors modified prey behavior depending not only on the predator species, but also on the rodent species. Consequently, owl playbacks could be regarded as a promising rodent control tool, knowing that future studies would be critical to deeply understand differences between species in order to select the most effective predator cues.","[Hernandez, Ma Carmen; Barja, Isabel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Lab Ethophysiol, Dept Biol, Unit Zool, C Darwin 2,Campus Univ Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Jara-Stapfer, Denise M.; Rubio, Andre V.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Dept Ciencias Biol Anim, Santa Rosa 11735, Santiago 8820808, Chile; [Munoz, Ana; Bonacic, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecosistemas & Medio Ambiente, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Santiago 8940000, Chile; [Bonacic, Cristian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Med Vet, Santiago 8940000, Chile; [Barja, Isabel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Res Ctr Biodivers & Global Change CIBC UAM, Madrid 28049, Spain",,"Rubio, AV (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Vet & Pecuarias, Dept Ciencias Biol Anim, Santa Rosa 11735, Santiago 8820808, Chile.",mariacarmen.hernandez@uam.es; denise.jara.st@gmail.com; asmunoz1@uc.cl; bona@uc.cl; isabel.barja@uam.es; arubio@uchile.cl,"Bonacic, Cristian/O-2558-2014; Rubio, André V./M-5307-2015","Bonacic, Cristian/0000-0003-2175-076X; Rubio, André V./0000-0001-7297-9535; Barja Nunez, Isabel/0000-0002-8354-5342; /0000-0001-6918-6761",ANID/FONDECYT Initiation from The National Commission for Science and Technology of Chile (CONICYT) FONDECYT [11180631]; ANID + PAI Convocatoria Nacional de Subvencion a la Instalacion en la Academia 2018 [PAI77180009],This research was funded by ANID/FONDECYT Initiation No. 11180631 from The National Commission for Science and Technology of Chile (CONICYT) FONDECYT.

After training, the CS elicited two different conditioned fear responses from rats: a passive freezing response, and an active turning response. The balance between these two modes of conditioned responding depended upon the rat's recent history of encounters with the US. If rats had not recently encountered the US, then they responded to the CS by freezing. But after recently encountering the US, rats exhibited CS-evoked turning responses that were always directed away from the trained eyelid, even if the US had recently been delivered to the opposite (untrained) eyelid. This post-encounter turning behavior was not observed in rats that had been trained with unpaired presentations of the CS and US, indicating that even though CS-evoked turning was selectively expressed after recent encounters with the US, it was nonetheless a conditioned Pavlovian fear response that depended upon a learned association between the CS and US. Further supporting this conclusion, pharmacological inactivation experiments showed that expression of both freezing and turning behaviors depended upon lateralized circuits in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG) that are known to support expression of Pavlovian fear responses. These findings indicate that even though the ability of a CS to elicit Pavlovian fear responses depend upon the long-term history of CS US pairings, the mode of conditioned responding (freezing versus turning in the present experiments) can be modulated by short-term factors, such as the recent history of US encounters. We discuss neural mechanisms that might mediate such short-term transitions between different modes of defensive responding, and consider how dysregulation of such mechanisms might contribute to clinical anxiety disorders.

Here, we test whether behavioral profiles in an endangered ape, Javan gibbons (Hylobates moloch), correspond to varying degrees of human disturbance in a human-impacted sacred forest, Cagar Alam Leuweung Sancang, West Java. Data were collected August 2010-July 2011. Although all groups reacted differently to human presence, overall, gibbons responded by reducing time spent on conspicuous behavior (e.g., vocalizing, feeding, traveling, and social interactions) as the number of humans in the area increased or distance to the nearest human decreased. In addition, gibbon responses to encountering humans were also more like their responses to encountering potential predators than they were to encountering monkeys or other gibbons. These results support the hypothesis that as human presence and encounter rates increase, gibbons alter their behavior in ways consistent with anti-predator behaviors. Assessing how this endangered species responds to human presence is a vital part of their ultimate conservation.","[Reisland, Melissa A.; Lambert, Joanna E.] Univ Colorado, Program Environm Studies, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Malone, Nicholas] Univ Auckland, Sch Social Sci, Anthropol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Lambert, Joanna E.] Univ Colorado, Program Environm Studies, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Lambert, Joanna E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",,"Lambert, JE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Program Environm Studies, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.; Lambert, JE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Program Environm Studies, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.; Lambert, JE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",melissa.reisland@colorado.edu; n.malone@auckland.ac.nz; joanna.lambert@colorado.edu,,,Fulbright IIE Fellowship; Primate Conservation Inc.; International Primatological Society.,"This research was funded by a Fulbright IIE Fellowship awarded to M.A.R., a grant through Primate Conservation Inc., and a conservation grant through the International Primatological Society.

Because predator diversity and abundance decreases with increasing latitude, and differs between rural and urban areas, we should expect escape distance when a predator approached the individual to decrease with latitude and depend on urbanization. We measured the distance at which individual birds fled (flight initiation distance, FID, which represents a reliable and previously validated surrogate measure of response to predation risk) following a standardized protocol in nine pairs of rural and urban sites along a ca. 3000 km gradient from Southern Spain to Northern Finland during the breeding seasons 2009-2010. Raptor abundance was estimated by means of standard point counts at the same sites where FID information was recorded. Data on body mass and phylogenetic relationships among bird species sampled were extracted from the literature. An analysis of 12,495 flight distances of 714 populations of 159 species showed that mean FID decreased with increasing latitude after accounting for body size and phylogenetic effects. This decrease was paralleled by a similar cline in an index of the abundance of raptors. Urban populations had consistently shorter FIDs, supporting previous findings. The difference between rural and urban habitats decreased with increasing latitude, also paralleling raptor abundance trends. Overall, the latitudinal gradient in bird fear was explained by raptor abundance gradients, with additional small effects of latitude and intermediate effects of habitat. This study provides the first empirical documentation of a latitudinal trend in anti-predator behavior, which correlated positively with a similar trend in the abundance of predators.","[Diaz, Mario] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change BGC, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris 11, CNRS UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Orsay, France; [Grim, Tomas] Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Grim, Tomas] Ornithol Lab, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Diego Ibanez-Alamo, Juan] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain; [Jokimaki, Jukka] Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Jokimaki, Jukka] Rovaniemi Univ Appl Sci, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Marko, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Behav Ecol Grp, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Budapest, Hungary; [Marko, Gabor] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Plant Pathol, Budapest, Hungary; [Tryjanowski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Poznan, Poland",,"Diaz, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change BGC, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Mario.Diaz@ccma.csic.es,"Ibáñez-Álamo, Juan Diego/H-7624-2019; Marko, Gabor/AAX-1166-2020; Jokimäki, Jukka/L-4434-2013; Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016; Díaz, Mario/C-3052-2017; Grim, Tomas/A-2852-2008","Marko, Gabor/0000-0003-1351-4070; Jokimäki, Jukka/0000-0002-7903-4128; Moller, Anders/0000-0003-3739-4675; Díaz, Mario/0000-0002-6384-6674; Ibanez Alamo, Juan Diego/0000-0002-2136-1767; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797; Grim, Tomas/0000-0002-5775-6269","Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGY69/07, MSM6198959212]; EU Regional Development Foundation [A31026]; RISKDISP of the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2009-08430];  [TAMOP-4.2.1./B-09/1-KMR-2010-0005];  [TAMOP-4.2.2./B-10/1-2010-0023]","TG was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program (RGY69/07) and MSM6198959212.

Because an escape response is costly, behavioural adjustments of animals in terms of increased tolerance of humans occurs and is often reported in the literature. However, most such studies have been conducted in and around long-existing cities in Europe and North America, on well-established animal populations. Here, we investigate the degree of tolerance of human disturbance across 132 bird species occurring in disturbed (small farms) and undisturbed (intact wetlands and grasslands) areas in Pantanal, Mato Grosso (Brazil), a region with only a very recent history of human-induced disturbance. We found a clear across-species trend toward higher tolerance of human disturbance in birds near farms when compared with birds in wild areas. Such a flexible and perhaps also rapid emergence of tolerance when facing small-scale and very recent human disturbance presumably involves learning and might be attributed to behavioural plasticity. The ability of birds to modify their degree of tolerance of human disturbance may play a key role in the facilitation of wildlife-human coexistence.","[Tryjanowski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Poiskiego 71c, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland; [Tryjanowski, Piotr] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Facu Environm Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic; [Kosicki, Jakub Z.] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Avian Biol & Ecol, Fac Biol, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Hromada, Martin] Univ Presov, Lab & Museum Evolutionary Ecol, Dept Ecol, Fac Humanities & Nat Sci, 17 Novembra 1, PL-08001 Presov, Poland; [Hromada, Martin] Univ Zieiona Gora, Fac Biol Sci, Prof Z Szafrana 1, PL-65516 Zieiona Gora, Poland; [Mikula, Peter] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic",,"Tryjanowski, P (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Poiskiego 71c, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.; Tryjanowski, P (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Facu Environm Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic.",piotr.tryjanowski@gmail.com,"Hromada, Martin/I-7409-2019; Mikula, Peter/I-3851-2016","Hromada, Martin/0000-0002-5626-1205; Mikula, Peter/0000-0002-2731-9105; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797; Kosicki, Jakub/0000-0002-9044-7775",Slovak Research and Development AgencySlovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-16-0411],"This research was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-16-0411.

Abnormally exaggerated fear and anxiety are some of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases in the human society whose mechanisms are not well understood. These diseases still represent major unmet medical needs. Ethologically relevant fear paradigms involving the presentation of predators, or of stimuli characteristic of predators, have been proposed as appropriate for the modeling and the analysis of fear responses. Previously, we have shown that zebrafish respond specifically to visual stimuli of their sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish. In the current paper we show that an animated (moving) image of this predator elicits significant behavioral responses and that these responses can be quantified using video-tracking. As stimulus presentation and behavioral response quantification are both computerized and automated, we suggest the paradigm is appropriate for high throughput screening and, once pharmacologically and behaviorally validated, may have utility in the detection of anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties of compounds or in the identification of fear altering mutations.

Different personality traits are phenotypically correlated, and heritabilities of personality traits have been reported in humans and various animals. In great tits, consistent heritable differences have been found in relation to exploration, which is correlated with various other personality traits. In this paper, we investigate whether or not risk-taking behaviour is part of these avian personalities. We found that (i) risk-taking behaviour is repeatable and correlated with exploratory behaviour in wild-caught hand-reared birds, (ii) in a bi-directional selection experiment on 'fast' and 'slow' early exploratory behaviour, bird lines tend to differ in risk-taking behaviour, and (iii) within-nest variation of risk-taking behaviour is smaller than between-nest variation. To show that risk-taking behaviour has a genetic component in a natural bird population, we bred great tits in the laboratory and artificially selected 'high' and 'low' risk-taking behaviour for two generations. Here, we report a realized heritability of 19.3 +/- 3.3% (s.e.m.) for risk-taking behaviour. With these results we show in several ways that risk-taking behaviour is linked to exploratory behaviour, and we therefore have evidence for the existence of avian personalities. Moreover, we prove that there is heritable variation in more than one correlated personality trait in a natural population, which demonstrates the potential for correlated evolution.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands",,"van Oers, K (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, POB 40, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",k.vanoers@nioo.knaw.nl,"van noordwijk, arie/A-8880-2011; van Oers, Kees/B-2562-2009","van Oers, Kees/0000-0001-6984-906X",,,,79,311,317,0,210,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We used a modified version of the trimethylthiazoline (TMT)-avoidance task, a measure of unconditional fear. Halfway into a corridor maze we placed a 3-cm-high barrier. This provided a wall in the middle of the corridor, one that the mice can easily climb over. Saline-and morphine-treated mice were randomly placed in the 'safe' or 'unsafe' (TMT) side and observed for 10 min. As expected, saline-injected mice spent only about 25% of the time in the TMT side, regardless of the side they were initially placed into. In contrast, morphine-treated mice did not cross the barrier even once, regardless of their initial placement. Specifically, morphine-treated mice initially placed in the TMT side appeared to exhibit the expected reduction in unconditional fear, that is, spending the entire time in the TMT side, a significant increase over the controls. Yet, morphine-treated mice placed in the safe side never even entered the TMT side; thus, these mice appeared to exhibit a behavioural response that is classically interpreted as increased fear, that is, spending significantly less time in the TMT side versus the controls. In summary, this study demonstrates that the classical interpretation of some unconditioned fear or anxiety tests could be misleading when animals are under the influence of drugs that might induce other competing behaviours.","[Hodgson, S.

This led to a decision by regional authorities to ban consumption of those species. We conducted a questionnaire-based study on 276 users of four lakes of the region, two of which were affected by the ban, in order to better understand how it had affected perception of the risk and the associated behaviors. Our study revealed that anglers were the major fish consumers. It also showed that the ban had a poor impact on anglers' actual fish consumption, despite their being globally well informed about its existence. We conclude that the ban has had a weak impact on anglers' perception of risk, and that safety nutrition policies should better take into account this factor in the future.","[Gilfriche, Pierre; Andre, Jean-Marc; Lespinet-Najib, Veronique] ENSC BdxINP, Cognit, IMS UMR 5218, Bordeaux, France; [Gentes, Sophie; Maury-Brachet, Regine; Legeay, Alexia; Feurtet-Mazel, Agnes] Univ Bordeaux, UMR EPOC CNRS 5805, Arcachon, France",,"Gilfriche, P (corresponding author), STAPS, 12 Ave Camille Jullian, F-33607 Pessac, France.",pierre.gilfriche@u-bordeaux.fr,,"ANDRE, jean-marc/0000-0001-9844-4694; Legeay, Alexia/0000-0002-1052-142X; gentes, sophie/0000-0002-5392-793X",,,,44,0,0,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Here, we examined one such odor, TMT, isolated from the fox, a predator of the rat, on fear-induced behaviors, serum corticosterone, and central dopamine metabolism Habituated rats were exposed to TMT, or a control odor, butyric acid, in an open field. For comparison, other rats were subjected to a model of conditioned fear - a traditional fear model. Several similarities between the two stresses were observed including increased serum corticosterone and increased dopamine metabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex. Differences were also observed. TMT, but not conditioned fear, activated dopamine metabolism in the amygdala, but not the nucleus accumbens core and shell. Rats exposed to conditioned fear, but not TMT odor, demonstrated altered behaviors associated with fear, including locomotion, grooming and immobility. Finally, rats reexposed to TMT after a 24-h delay did not demonstrate any of the changes observed with acute exposure to TMT. These data indicate acute exposure to a predator odor, TMT, can result in a unique pattern of biochemical activation that is similar, but not identical, to conditioned fear. The differences may indicate unique features of a central 'fear arousal' pathway that responds to innate, unlearned stressful stimuli, such as predator odors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN.

Lateral bedding posture bias may reflect difference in monitoring and these changing patterns of risk stimuli. I studied wild elk in Banff and Jasper National Parks, Canada, where habituated animals enter into conflicts with humans, abandon migration, and negatively affect entire ecosystems. I recorded lateral bedding postures and lateral differences in detection distances when elk were approached. Elk had leftward posture biases when facing away from the herd toward the presumptive direction of potential predation, but had rightward biases when facing towards conspecifics. I found migratory elk had stronger lateral biases than elk residing year-round near humans. These results show lateral posture biases are context dependent on risk, and as these risks change, lateral biases change as well. These results provide important insights for the management of prey species subject to changing patterns of predation and human disturbance, and contribute to our growing understanding of the ecological implications of laterality in wild species.","[Found, Rob] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Found, Rob] Trent Univ, Wildlife Res & Monitoring Sect, Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Peterborough, ON, Canada",,"Found, R (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Wildlife Res & Monitoring Sect, Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Peterborough, ON, Canada.",found@ualberta.ca,,,"Alberta Conservation Association [0000334393]; Alberta Sports, Parks, Recreation and Wildlife Foundation [0008780]; Canadian Circumpolar Institute [0010338]; Alberta Ingenuity/Innovates; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","I am grateful to Alberta Conservation Association [grant number 0000334393], Alberta Sports, Parks, Recreation and Wildlife Foundation [grant number 0008780], Canadian Circumpolar Institute [grant number 0010338], Alberta Ingenuity/Innovates (graduate scholarships to R.

Communities with multiple predators that interact and differ in their use of space, time of activity and hunting mode create a complex landscape for prey to avoid predation. Anthropogenic presence and disturbance have the potential to shift interactions among predators and prey and the where and when encounters occur. We examined how white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus fawn spatiotemporal antipredator behaviour differed along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient that had black bears Ursus americanus, coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus and humans present. We quantified (a) spatial co-occurrence in species distributions, (b) temporal overlap across the diel cycle and (c) spatiotemporal associations between humans, bears, coyotes, bobcats, adult male deer and fawns. We also examined how deer vigilance behaviour changed across the anthropogenic disturbance gradient and survey duration. Anthropogenic disturbance influenced spatiotemporal co-occurrence across multiple scales, often increasing spatiotemporal overlap among species. In general, species' spatial co-occurrence was neutral or positive in anthropogenically disturbed environments. Bears and fawns, coyotes and adult male deer, and bobcats and fawns all had higher temporal overlap in the agriculture-development matrix sites. In addition, factors that influenced deer vigilance (e.g. distance to forest edge and predator relative abundance) in the agriculture-development matrix sites did not in the forest matrix site. By taking into account the different antipredator behaviours that can be detected and the different scales these behaviours might occur, we were able to gain a more comprehensive picture of how humans reduce available niche space for wildlife, creating the neutral and positive spatiotemporal associations between species that studies have been seeing in more disturbed areas.","[Murphy, Asia] Penn State Univ, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Diefenbach, Duane R.] Penn State Univ, US Geol Survey, Penn Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ternent, Mark; Lovallo, Matt] Penn Game Commiss, Harrisburg, PA USA; [Miller, David] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Murphy, A (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Intercoll Grad Degree Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",aum432@psu.edu,,,Pennsylvania Game Commission; PNC Financial Corporation; Pennsylvania State University; PNC Financial Corporation Graduate Fellowship; Penn State Alumni Association Graduate Fellowship; Penn State Bunton-Waller Graduate Award,Pennsylvania Game Commission; PNC Financial Corporation; Pennsylvania State University; PNC Financial Corporation Graduate Fellowship; Penn State Alumni Association Graduate Fellowship; Penn State Bunton-Waller Graduate Award,,69,0,0,8,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Fraser Island is home to an iconic population of dingoes (Canis dingo). However, conflict stemming from negative human-dingo interactions (incidents), some resulting in serious human injury and in one case, a fatality, is an ongoing concern. In an effort to highlight important factors influencing incident dynamics, we investigated the most serious incident reports gathered by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service for the period 2001-15. We found a consistent pattern of incidents peaking in March/April and also July, corresponding with dingo breeding and whelping seasons (respectively). Monthly vehicle permit numbers (a proxy for visitation) were not positively correlated with incident rates, except during the breeding season. Male dingoes, particularly subadult males, featured heavily in incidents. Despite the fatality being highly publicised and the advent of copious on-site warning messages and other management interventions, serious incidents continue to occur annually, including some involving children. This suggests that risks are either not always understood, or are otherwise being ignored. While our results demonstrate that dingoes generally pose minimal risk to humans, some risk remains, particularly where poorly supervised children are concerned.","[Appleby, Rob; Mackie, Jess; Bernede, Lilia; Jones, Darryl] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Smith, Bradley] Cent Queensland Univ, Appleton Inst, Sch Human Hlth & Social Sci, 44 Greenhill Rd, Wayville, SA 5034, Australia",,"Appleby, R (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",rob.appleby@wildspy.com.au,,"Smith, Bradley/0000-0002-0873-3917; Jones, Darryl/0000-0002-2565-9456","Queensland Department of Science, Information Technology and Innovation","We thank Linda Behrendorff, Moyra McRae, Dan Novak and Dan Clifton from the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service for their insights and support.

We discuss the relative importance of various metal sources for aquatic invertebrates. First, we address the question do sediment-dwelling animals take up their metals from the overlying water compartment or the sediment compartment or both (both compartments include water and particles). We find that the overlying water column is more important as a metal source for insects, whereas the sediment compartment is more important for oligochaete worms. We explain this tendency by the behaviors of the animals involved. Second, we ask the question do animals take up their metals from food or water within a given compartment. Through case studies on three widespread freshwater invertebrates, we conclude that for some predatory insects food is their major source of several metals, whereas for the crustacean Hyalella both food and water appear to be important depending on the metal involved and the experimental protocol used to study the question. We conclude that ignoring food as a metal source could severely underestimate metal exposures for some animals. We suggest that integrating these complexities into laboratory tests and risk assessment protocols will improve their meaningfulness and thus their ability to protect aquatic ecosystems.","Univ Quebec, INRS ETE, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; Environm Canada, Natl Water Res Inst, Burlington, ON L7R 4A6, Canada",,"Hare, L (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, INRS ETE, CP 7500, Ste Foy, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",landis@inrs-ete.uquebec.ca,,,,,,56,54,60,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1080-7039,1549-7860,,HUM ECOL RISK ASSESS,Hum.

Animal models have been proposed to facilitate this research. Here I review the literature with a focus on zebrafish, an upcoming laboratory organism in behavioral brain research. I argue that abnormal human fear responses are likely the result of the malfunction of neurobiological mechanisms (brain areas, circuits and/or molecular mechanisms) that originally evolved to support avoidance of predators or other harm in nature. I also argue that the understanding of the normal as well as pathological functioning of such mechanisms may be best achieved if one utilizes naturalistic experimental approaches. In case of laboratory model organisms, this may entail presenting stimuli associated with predators and measuring species-specific antipredatory responses. Although zebrafish is a relatively new subject of such inquiry, I review the recently rapidly increasing number of zebrafish studies in this area, and conclude that zebrafish is a promising research tool for the analysis of the neurobiology and genetics of vertebrate fear responses.

In this review, we focus on the effects of human disturbance on terrestrial apex predators. We summarize their ecological role in nature and how they respond to different sources of human disturbance. Apex predators control their prey and smaller predators numerically and via behavioral changes to avoid predation risk, which in turn can affect lower trophic levels. Crucially, reducing population numbers and triggering behavioral responses are also the effects that human disturbance causes to apex predators, which may in turn influence their ecological role. Some populations continue to be at the brink of extinction, but others are partially recovering former ranges, via natural recolonization and through reintroductions. Carnivore recovery is both good news for conservation and a challenge for management, particularly when recovery occurs in human-dominated landscapes. Therefore, we conclude by discussing several management considerations that, adapted to local contexts, may favor the recovery of apex predator populations and their ecological functions in nature.","[Ordiz, Andres; Aronsson, Malin; Persson, Jens] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Ordiz, Andres; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, Postbox 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Aronsson, Malin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Kindberg, Jonas] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden",,"Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.; Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, Postbox 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com; malin.aronsson@slu.se; Jens.Persson@slu.se; ole.stoen@nina.no; jon.swenson@nmbu.no; jonas.kindberg@rovdata.no,"Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020","Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Persson, Jens/0000-0003-1405-7561; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457",Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; Swedish Carnivore Association for Hunting andWildlife Management; Swedish Carnivore Association; WWF Sweden; Carl Tryggers Foundation; Marie-Claire Cronstedt Foundation; FormasSwedish Research Council Formas [2015-826],"The Scandinavian bear and wolverine research projects have been funded by the Norwegian Environment Agency, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Norwegian Research Council, Austrian Science Fund, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, Swedish Association for Hunting andWildlife Management, Swedish Carnivore Association, WWF Sweden, Carl Tryggers Foundation, and Marie-Claire Cronstedt Foundation.

In countryside landscapes, many habitat structures remain intact, providing suitable habitat for wildlife species that can accurately assess novel risks and develop tolerance to benign disturbances. Associative learning that promotes avoidance and also facilitates desensitization to benign disturbance is key to persisting in these landscapes. Conversely, learning to distinguish and avoid negative interactions with humans, like hunting, is vital. To determine if eastern gray kangaroos are capable of learning from previous interactions with humans, we tested the flight responses of wild kangaroos which have previously experienced either low or high frequencies of harmful and benign encounters with humans. We found that eastern gray kangaroos rapidly habituated to benign disturbance as there was no significant difference in assessment distance between groups that previously experienced low or high frequencies of disturbance. The threat of harmful disturbances was not as quickly learnt, as groups that experienced low frequencies of harmful disturbance delayed flight longer than those experiencing frequent harm. We found that the influence of environmental and group parameters on a kangaroo's decision to flee depended on the intent and frequency of previous interactions with humans. Our study indicates that kangaroos are learning from previous encounters with humans, correctly assessing novel risks which may be contributing to their persistence in countryside landscapes.","[Austin, Caitlin M.; Ramp, Daniel] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",,"Austin, CM; Ramp, D (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",Caitlin.Austin@uts.edu.au; Daniel.Ramp@uts.edu.au,"Ramp, Daniel/C-3692-2008","Ramp, Daniel/0000-0003-3202-9898; Austin, Caitlin/0000-0002-0949-8314",Detroit Zoological Society,Detroit Zoological Society,,93,4,4,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We investigate variables that are affecting conditioning and if the presence of human-induced injuries is higher for conditioned versus unconditioned dolphins. Using the most comprehensive long-term dataset available for a free-ranging bottlenose dolphin population (more than 45 years; more than 32000 dolphin group sightings; more than 1100 individuals), we found that the association with already conditioned animals strongly affected the probability of dolphins becoming conditioned to human interactions, confirming earlier findings that conditioning is partly a learned behaviour. More importantly, we found that conditioned dolphins were more likely to be injured by human interactions when compared with unconditioned animals. This is alarming, as conditioning could lead to a decrease in survival, which could have population-level consequences. We did not find a significant relationship between human exposure or natural prey availability and the probability of dolphins becoming conditioned. This could be due to low sample size or insufficient spatio-temporal resolution in the available data. Our findings show that wildlife provisioning may lead to a decrease in survival, which could ultimately affect population dynamics.","[Christiansen, Fredrik; Bejder, Lars] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Cetacean Res Unit, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [McHugh, Katherine A.; McCabe, Elizabeth Berens; Wells, Randall S.] Chicago Zool Soc, Sarasota Dolphin Res Program, Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL USA; [Siegal, Eilidh M.; Lusseau, David] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Lovewell, Gretchen] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA",,"Christiansen, F (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Cetacean Res Unit, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",f.christiansen@murdoch.edu.au,"Bejder, Lars/D-1772-2017; Christiansen, Fredrik/O-3655-2017; Lusseau, David/AAV-9295-2021","Bejder, Lars/0000-0001-8138-8606; Christiansen, Fredrik/0000-0001-9090-8458; Lusseau, David/0000-0003-1245-3747; Siegal, Eilidh/0000-0002-7833-302X",US Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under NOAA Award [NA14OAR4170098]; Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium [R/MG/BR-15B],"This publication was supported by the US Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under NOAA Award NA14OAR4170098, the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium (Project R/MG/BR-15B).

While behaviors such as lethal predator control may impede predator restoration, other land management practices can facilitate coexistence between predators and humans. Socio-psychological theories provide useful tools for understanding and improving these human behaviors. We explore three frameworks to understand what shapes Australian livestock graziers' behaviors with regards to management of the threat that dingoes pose to livestock. These frameworks are the theory of reasoned action (incorporating values and beliefs about dingoes), the social identity approach, and perception of risk. We distributed a survey to Australian graziers by mail and online (n = 138) which allowed recording of information on these three frameworks and their engagement in lethal dingo control. Among the respondents, we found that all three frameworks were linked with lethal dingo control when assessed individually, but when combined in a hierarchical regression, only social identity (specifically, identifying as an environmentalist or pest controller) was significant in predicting behavior. This result reveals the strength of social norms and normative beliefs over perceived risk in shaping behavior. As such, social identity is a useful metric for predicting and understanding environmental management behavior. Determining what these social identities mean in a given context is important for identifying how to implement behavior change to promote evidence-based management that facilitates restoration of wildlife such as predators to landscapes where conflict with humans occurs.","[van Eeden, Lily M.; Crowther, Mathew S.; Dickman, Christopher R.; Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Slagle, Kristina] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"van Eeden, LM (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.",lily.vaneeden@sydney.edu.au,"Crowther, Mathew/M-7406-2013; Newsome, Thomas M/ABE-8451-2021; van Eeden, Lily/J-5541-2019","Crowther, Mathew/0000-0001-8968-1161; Newsome, Thomas M/0000-0003-3457-3256; van Eeden, Lily/0000-0002-0456-9670; Slagle, Kristina/0000-0002-6270-7568",Paddy Pallin Science Grant from the Royal Zoological Society of NSW; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment,This research was supported by funding from a Paddy Pallin Science Grant from the Royal Zoological Society of NSW and the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment.

While the impacts of such additional noise on avian sexual signals are well documented, our understanding of its effect in other terrestrial taxa, on other vocalisations, and on receivers is more limited. Little is known, for example, about the influence of anthropogenic noise on responses to vocalisations relating to predation risk, despite the potential fitness consequences. We use playback experiments to investigate the impact of traffic noise on the responses of foraging dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to surveillance calls produced by sentinels, individuals scanning for danger from a raised position whose presence usually results in reduced vigilance by foragers. Foragers exhibited a lessened response to surveillance calls in traffic-noise compared to ambient-sound playback, increasing personal vigilance. A second playback experiment, using noise playbacks without surveillance calls, suggests that the increased vigilance could arise in part from the direct influence of additional noise as there was an increase in response to traffic noise playback alone. Acoustic masking could also play a role. Foragers maintained the ability to distinguish between sentinels of different dominance class, increasing personal vigilance when presented with subordinate surveillance calls compared to calls of a dominant groupmate in both noise treatments, suggesting complete masking was not occurring. However, an acoustic-transmission experiment showed that while surveillance calls were potentially audible during approaching traffic noise, they were probably inaudible during peak traffic intensity noise. While recent work has demonstrated detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise on defensive responses to actual predatory attacks, which are relatively rare, our results provide evidence of a potentially more widespread influence since animals should constantly assess background risk to optimise the foraging-vigilance trade-off.

Small mammals select microhabitat features such as tree and shrub canopy cover, woody debris and vegetative ground cover that can lower the risk of detection from predators and provide greater protection if discovered. Small mammals also increase foraging activity and decrease selection for cover when cloud cover increases and moon illumination is less. Often researchers assume small mammals in urban areas respond to these cues in the same manner as in natural areas, but these cues themselves are altered in urban zones. In this study, we investigated how Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) and coarse woody debris (CWD) affected giving-up density (GUD) in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). Each of three habitat treatments (open flood channel, the edge and interior of the honeysuckle patch) contained cover treatments with coarse woody debris present or absent. The six treatment combinations were compared to environmental variables (temperature, humidity and illumination) and habitat variables to test their effect on GUD. Peromyscus leucopus foraged to lower densities in areas with CWD present and also under the honeysuckle canopy, using this invasive shrub to decrease predation risk, potentially increasing survivability within this urban park. Increased human presence negatively affected foraging behavior across treatments. Human presence and light pollution significantly influenced P.leucopus, modifying their foraging behavior and demonstrating that both fine- and coarse-scale urban factors can affect small mammals. Foraging increased as humidity increased, particularly under the honeysuckle canopy. Changes in illumination due to moonlight and cloud cover did not affect foraging behavior, suggesting urban light pollution may have altered behavioral responses to changes in light levels. Lonicera maackii seemed to facilitate foraging in P.leucopus, even though it adversely affects the plant community, suggesting that its impact may not be entirely negative.","[Persons, William E.; Eason, Perri] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",,"Eason, P (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",perri.eason@louisville.edu,,"Persons, William/0000-0002-7792-6675","Biology Department, University of Louisville","Biology Department, University of Louisville",,60,8,8,5,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,MAY,2017,123,5,,,,,348,356,,10.1111/eth.12604,,,9,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,ER5GX,WOS:000398830800003,,,,,2022-04-19,

To quantify time budgets, we took regular field observations on focal individuals of Nubian ibex classified according to their habitat, group size, sex, and age. For each focal observation, we quantified environmental variables that were thought to influence the behavioral responses of ibex. Then, we developed behavioral models by correlating the proportion of behaviors measured in focal animal observations to the influential environmental variables. The behaviors of Nubian ibex significantly varied with sex and age structure, season, habitat type, and slope conditions. Adult females are more vigilant than adult male ibex, especially in the spring. This correlates with breeding and nursing activities. Based on the characteristics of the habitat, ibex behave to minimize risks of predation and human nuisance disturbances while maximizing their food intake.","[Tadesse, Solomon A.; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitriani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel",,"Tadesse, SA (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitriani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",tadesse@bgu.ac.il,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research,"We are grateful to Mohammed Kedir for his assistance in the field work, and especially thank Yaron Ziv and Ofer Ovadia for their valuable comments during different stages of this work.

While some laboratories have reported fear-like alterations in behavior, other laboratories, including our own, have failed to consistently observe fearful behaviors in rats exposed to the predator odor TMT. One potential contributing factor to this discrepancy is the handling of the rat and its test environment. In the current report, we examine biochemical, endocrinological, and behavioral effects of TMT in two distinct open fields: one small, familiar, and dimly lit, while the other was large, novel, and brightly lit. Only exposure to TMT in the large, novel open field resulted in fearful behavior; however, no increase in dopamine turnover was noted compared to no odor and control odor rats. As expected, the different open fields resulted in some biochemical and behavioral differences, including more horizontal locomotion and less grooming, higher serum corticosterone, and increased dopamine turnover in the ventral prefrontal cortex in the large open field. Finally, compared to the same open field controls, TMT exposure elevated rat serum corticosterone levels in both open fields and dopamine turnover in the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala of rats only in the small, familiar open field. These results indicate that the TMT-induced biochemical activation of may occur without detectable fearful behaviors and may indicate a mechanism that prepares the animal for the expression of a fearful response if additional provocative stimuli are present.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Lab Neuropsychopharmacol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Lab Neuropsychopharmacol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,"Morrow, BA (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Lab Neuropsychopharmacol, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",bret.morrow@yale.edu,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH014092, R37MH014092] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA011288] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [DA-11288] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH-14092] Funding Source: Medline",,,21,66,66,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0887-4476,1098-2396,,SYNAPSE,Synapse,OCT,2002,46,1,,,,,11,18,,10.1002/syn.10109,,,8,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,586WW,WOS:000177610000003,12211094,,,,2022-04-19,

Many studies focus on how noise impacts single sensory channels but in reality animals rely on multimodal sources of information. In this study, we investigated the effect of anthropogenic noise and the visual presence of a predator on tactile information gathering during gastropod shell assessment in the European hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. For hermit crabs, empty gastropod shells are a crucial resource affecting growth, reproduction, and survival. We measured shell assessment behavior and manipulated 1) the shell size (50% or 80% of the optimal), 2) sound condition (ship or ambient), and 3) visual predator cue (absence/presence). Overall we found that crabs were less likely to accept an optimal shell in the presence of ship noise, suggesting that exposure to ship noise disrupted the information gathering ability of the crabs. We also found a significant interaction between noise, predator presence, and shell size on the mean duration for the final decision to accept or reject the optimal shell. Hermit crabs in 50% shells took less time for their final decision when exposed to both ship noise and predator cue while crabs in 80% shells showed shorter decision time only when the predator cue was absent. Our results indicate that anthropogenic noise can interact with predation threat and resource quality to change resource acquisition, suggesting that noise pollution can disrupt behavior in a nonadditive way, by disrupting information use across multiple sensory channels.","[Tidau, Svenja; Briffa, Mark] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",,"Tidau, S (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",svenja.tidau@plymouth.ac.uk,"Tidau, Svenja/AAN-2688-2021; Briffa, Mark/M-9041-2013","Tidau, Svenja/0000-0003-0336-0450; Briffa, Mark/0000-0003-2520-0538","European Commission Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Programme on Marine Ecosystem Health Conservation [2012-1720/001-001-EMJD, FPA 2011-0016]; University of Plymouth, U.K.","The work leading to this publication was part of a PhD scholarship awarded to S.T. co-funded by the European Commission Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Programme (2012-1720/001-001-EMJD) on Marine Ecosystem Health & Conservation coordinated by Ghent University, Belgium (FPA 2011-0016), and the University of Plymouth, U.K.",,74,4,4,8,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

This is thought to reflect adaptive, behavioral manipulation by Toxoplasma in that the parasite, although capable of infecting rats, reproduces sexually only in the gut of the cat. The behavioral manipulation hypothesis postulates that a parasite will specifically manipulate host behaviors essential for enhancing its own transmission. However, the neural circuits implicated in innate fear, anxiety, and learned fear all overlap considerably, raising the possibility that Toxoplasma may disrupt all of these nonspecifically. We investigated these conflicting predictions. In mice and rats, latent Toxoplasma infection converted the aversion to feline odors into attraction. Such loss of fear is remarkably specific, because infection did not diminish learned fear, anxiety-like behavior, olfaction, or nonaversive learning. These effects are associated with a tendency for parasite cysts to be more abundant in amygdalar structures than those found in other regions of the brain. By closely examining other types of behavioral patterns that were predicted to be altered we show that the behavioral effect of chronic Toxoplasma infection is highly specific. Overall, this study provides a strong argument in support of the behavioral manipulation hypothesis. Proximate mechanisms of such behavioral manipulations remain unknown, although a subtle tropism on part of the parasite remains a potent possibility.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Vyas, A (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ajaivyas@stanford.edu,"Vyas, Ajai/A-2223-2011","Vyas, Ajai/0000-0002-2592-6796; Boothroyd, John C./0000-0001-9719-745X","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI041014, AI41014] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21 MH070903, MH70903] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI041014] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH070903] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,33,365,385,8,331,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We set out to compare whether escape durations of three species of corvids differ depending on how a human observer (in the role of a predator) behaves after the escape has begun. When birds were being followed during escape, escape durations were the longest, escape trajectory was modified the most during escape, and a larger proportion of individuals changed from terrestrial to aerial escape strategy compared to observations where birds were not followed. Mean horizontal escape angle of ca 120 degrees was also a potential indication that monitoring the threat is taken into account when deciding on the escape trajectory. While there were some differences between the behaviour of these three closely related species, the general patterns supported the notion that birds dynamically assess risk during escape to find an optimal balance between getting caught and spending too much time and energy on escaping.

Current research suggests the evolution of a fear processing module in the brain to cope with these threats. Recently, humans increasingly encountered modern threats (e.g., guns or car accidents) in addition to evolutionary threats (e.g., snakes or predators) which presumably required an adaptation of perception and behavior. However, the neural processes underlying the perception of these different threats remain to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of image content (i.e., evolutionary vs. modern threats) on the activation of neural networks of emotion processing. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 41 participants watched affective pictures displaying evolutionary-threatening, modern-threatening, evolutionary-neutral and modern-neutral content. Evolutionary-threatening stimuli evoked stronger activations than modern-threatening stimuli in left inferior frontal gyrus and thalamus, right middle frontal gyrus and parietal regions as well as bilaterally in parietal regions, fusiform gyrus and bilateral amygdala. We observed the opposite effect, i.e., higher activity for modern-threatening than for evolutionary-threatening stimuli, bilaterally in the posterior cingulate and the parahippocampal gyrus. We found no differences in subjective arousal ratings between the two threatening conditions. On the valence scale though, subjects rated modern-threatening pictures significantly more negative than evolutionary-threatening pictures, indicating a higher level of perceived threat. The majority of previous studies show a positive relationship between arousal rating and amygdala activity. However, comparing fMRI results with behavioral findings we provide evidence that neural activity in fear processing areas is not only driven by arousal or valence, but presumably also by the evolutionary content of the stimulus. This has also fundamental methodological implications, in the sense to suggest a more elaborate classification of stimulus content to improve the validity of experimental designs.","[Dhum, Matthias; Herwig, Uwe; Siegrist, Michael] ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Dept Consumer Behav, Zurich, Switzerland; [Herwig, Uwe; Opialla, Sarah; Bruehl, Annette B.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Univ Hosp Psychiat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Herwig, Uwe] Univ Ulm, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy 3, Ulm, Germany",,"Herwig, U (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Environm Decis, Dept Consumer Behav, Zurich, Switzerland.; Herwig, U (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Univ Hosp Psychiat, Zurich, Switzerland.; Herwig, U (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy 3, Ulm, Germany.",uwe.herwig@puk.zh.ch,"Bruehl, Annette Beatrix/A-5272-2013; Siegrist, Michael/A-1032-2008","Bruehl, Annette Beatrix/0000-0003-4704-4986; Siegrist, Michael/0000-0002-6139-7190",,,,48,6,6,2,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,,,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

Level of risk-taking is often estimated as flight initiation distance (FID), which is assumed to reflect the trade-off between costs of escape and benefits of staying put. Despite costs and benefits of escape may change during the season, previous studies have focused mainly on breeding bird populations. Here, we focused on risk taking in migratory and resident populations of waders (Charadriiformes) at the wintering grounds in tropical Africa. Phylogenetically informed comparative analyses revealed significant correlation between starting distance, body mass and, marginally, reproductive effort and FID, but no correlation between flock size and FID in wintering waders. Interestingly, despite no differences in body mass, reproductive effort and flock size, FID significantly differed between migratory and resident wader species after controlling for the potential effect of confounding variables, with FID being shorter in resident species. This suggests that such differences in risk perception are linked to some other factors as, for instance, the level of familiarity of waders with local environments at their wintering grounds and previous experience with humans. Our results may have also implications for avian conservation of migratory species at wintering grounds.","[Mikula, Peter; Albrecht, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Diaz, Mario] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Madrid, Spain; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, Ecol Systemat Evolut, CNRS,AgroParisTech, Orsay, France; [Albrecht, Tomas] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Tryjanowski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Poznan, Poland; [Hromada, Martin] Univ Presov, Fac Humanities & Nat Sci, Lab & Museum Evolutionary Ecol, Presov, Slovakia; [Hromada, Martin] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Biol Sci, Zielona Gora, Poland",,"Mikula, P (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",petomiku1a158@gmail.com,"Mikula, Peter/I-3851-2016; Albrecht, Tomas/A-1130-2011; Díaz, Mario/C-3052-2017; Hromada, Martin/I-7409-2019","Mikula, Peter/0000-0002-2731-9105; Díaz, Mario/0000-0002-6384-6674; Hromada, Martin/0000-0002-5626-1205; Tryjanowski, Piotr/0000-0002-8358-0797",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-36098G]; ITMS [26110230119]; VEGAVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)European Commission [1/0977/16],"We are thankful to Gabriel Saffa for assistance during fieldwork in Kenya, and to Radoslav Smolak, Miroslava Klimovicova and Jozef Obona for support during a field trip.

Risk of lion attack on livestock (i.e., depredation) may vary seasonally and may be associated with variation in wild prey abundance or landscape characteristics. To test these competing hypotheses, we used a resource selection approach, and determined whether prey catchability (indicated by geo-spatial variables), or prey availability (indicated by modeled abundance recorded via camera traps) explained spatial and seasonal variation in livestock depredation risk by African lions on Manyara Ranch Conservancy, a multi-use area in northern Tanzania. Seasonal variation in vegetative productivity and proximity to surface water appeared to be strong predictors of livestock depredation risk. Correlates for depredation risk were different between wet and dry seasons. During the dry season, depredation risk was positively correlated with vegetative productivity, whereas depredation risk during the wet season was highest near livestock enclosures (bomas). During both seasons, depredation risk was high closer to surface water. Landscape-driven risk maps were created to identify low risk areas that may be compatible with livestock grazing. Our results on depredation risk by lions are similar to other studies in protected areas and suggest that both prey catchability and prey availability are instrumental in predicting kill sites of lions. To facilitate lion and livestock coexistence in multi-use areas of Africa, we recommend minimizing spatiotemporal overlap between livestock and abundant wild prey by developing alternative livestock water and feeding locations and increasing caution near surface water areas.","[Beattie, K.] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Beattie, K.; Olson, E.

Laboratory experiments examined feeding and respiration rates of the caddisfly Sericostoma vittatum as well as the growth, emergence and respiration rates of the midge Chironomus riparius, exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of imidacloprid. The effects of the two stressors on burrowing behaviour of both species were also assessed. The results show significant effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of imidacloprid on all endpoints studied. Perceived predation risk also elicited sub-lethal effects in C. riparius and S. vittatum, the latter species being less responsive to predation cues. The effects of simultaneous exposure to both types of stressors were assessed using two different approaches: analysis of variance and conceptual models [concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA)] normally used for the evaluation of contaminant mixture exposure. Both statistical approaches showed no significant interactions on responses in simultaneous exposures in the majority of parameters assessed with only a signification deviation from the reference CA and IA models being found for C. riparius respiration data contrary to the ANOVA results. Exposure to imidacloprid also compromised antipredator behavioural responses of both insect species, with potential negative consequences in terms of mortality from predation in the field. The results obtained demonstrate that natural and anthropogenic stressors can be treated within the same framework providing compatible data for modelling. For an improved interpretation of ecological effects it will be important to expand the mechanistic study of effects of combined exposure to pesticides and perceived predation risk by measuring different endpoints over a wider range of pesticide concentrations.

In predator-ungulate-plant systems, empirical research quantifying how predators affect ungulate group sizes and distribution, in the context of other influential variables, is particularly needed. The risk allocation hypothesis proposes that prey behavioral responses to predation risk depend on background frequencies of exposure to risk, and it can be used to make predictions about predator-ungulate-plant interactions. We determined non-predation variables that affect elk (Cervus elaphus) group sizes and distribution on a winter range in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) using logistic and log-linear regression on surveys of 513 1-km(2) areas conducted over two years. Employing model selection techniques, we evaluated risk allocation and other a priori hypotheses of elk group size and distributional responses to wolf (Canis lupus) predation risk while accounting for influential non-wolf-predation variables. We found little evidence that wolves affect elk group sizes, which were strongly influenced by habitat type and hunting by humans. Following predictions from the risk allocation hypothesis, wolves likely created a more dynamic elk distribution in areas that they frequently hunted, as elk tended to move following wolf encounters in those areas. This response should dilute elk foraging pressure on plant communities in areas where they are frequently hunted by wolves. We predict that this should decrease the spatial heterogeneity of elk impacts on grasslands in areas that wolves frequently hunt. We also predict that this should decrease browsing pressure on heavily browsed woody plant stands in certain areas, which is supported by recent research in the GYE.","Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; Montana Dept Fish Wildlife & Pk, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",,"Gude, JA (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Alaska Peninsula & Beacharof Natl Wildlife Refuge, POB 277, King Salmon, AK 99613 USA.",justin_gude@fws.gov,,,,,,45,76,77,8,80,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Human habitation can influence desert ecosystems directly through changes in land use and indirectly through the introduction of alien species that compete with locally adapted fauna. Native species can respond to these processes by spatial or temporal avoidance. Ruppell's fox is a desert-adapted species inhabiting flat, rocky arid areas that feeds mainly on invertebrates and rodents. We used location data and step selection functions to study the space use of a population in southern Israel. We hypothesized that Ruppell's fox movement would be influenced by topography due to preference for creeks, where insects and rodents are available, and by human infrastructure as the presence of humans, vehicles and associated animals may induce a fear effect on native species. Ruppell's fox habitat selection was seasonal. During the dry season, foxes showed preference for flatter areas and creek bottoms and avoided paved roads. During the rainy season, foxes avoided less- trafficked dirt roads. These patterns were likely a consequence of increased territoriality due to denning in the colder season and reduced availability of insects in the dry season. Avoidance of paved and dirt roads may be explained by fear of human presence and perception of risk due to the use of linear features by larger carnivores, such as wolves and red foxes. Our results suggest that current protected, remote and uninhabited areas have an elevated value for the persistence of Ruppell's fox populations. We recommend limitation of vehicle movement within current reserves and continued monitoring of population trends for this little studied carnivore.","[Barocas, Adi] San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA; [Barocas, Adi] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Hefner, Reuven; Shalmon, Benny] Israel Nat & Pk Author, IL-84215 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Ucko, Michal] Natl Ctr Mariculture, Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res, POB 1212, IL-88112 Elat, Israel; [Leader, Noam] Israel Nat & Pk Author, Sci Div, Ecol Dept, IL-95463 Jerusalem, Israel; [Geffen, Eli] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",,"Barocas, A (corresponding author), San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA.; Barocas, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",adibarocas@gmail.com,,"Barocas, Adi/0000-0001-5435-9711",Israel Nature and Parks Authority,Funding and logistic support for the research were provided by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.,,39,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Our previous work showed that habituated baboons displayed individually distinct and consistent responses to human approaches, a tolerance trait, but it is unknown if the trait is resilient to life-threatening scenarios. If it were consistent, it would imply FIDs might measure specific human threat perception only and not generalize to other threats such as predators when animals have experienced habituation processes. We used FID procedures to compare baseline responses to the visual orientation distance, FID, and individual tolerance estimates assessed after a leopard predation on an adult male baboon (group member). All variables were consistent despite the predation event, suggesting tolerance to observers was largely unaffected by the predation and FID procedures are unlikely to be generalizable to other threats when habituation has occurred.

Shrub and tree encroachment, and the expansion of forest birds and the formerly persecuted mammalian ungulates and carnivores, were highlighted as the major consequences of the rural exodus in Italy. In this report, we provide a more integrative view, and show that a rural exodus also explains other ecological phenomena that are usually treated independently. After reviewing the ecological consequences of the rural exodus that has been affecting a large part of Spain during the last six decades, we suggest that this set of ecological consequences also includes the movement of shy-selected predators and large, big game species out of their former ecological refuges, as well as increased frequencies of individuals with bolder-behaviours in recovering populations. We develop a tentative conceptual model linking the increasing approach of wildlife to anthropogenic habitats and human depopulation of rural areas. These links are created by the increasing difficulty to survive and reproduce in recovering, high-predation wild areas, due to mesopredator release and the loss of fear to humans, among other factors. We acknowledge that the recovery of formerly persecuted wildlife in depopulated landscapes has been helped by conservation policies, but we suggest that policies alone cannot explain the observed changes. Finally, we propose that the processes we analyse on a national scale could be taking place in Europe on a continental scale as well, and will most likely occur in the future in other regions of the world, with the current growth in economies.","[Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro; Galan, Pedro] Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Grp Invest Biol Evolut GIBE, Campus Zapateira S-N, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Jimenez, Juan] Generalitat Valenciana, Serv Vida Silvestre, Torre 1,C Democracia 77, Valencia 46018, Spain; [Jimenez, Ignacio] IUCN Conservat Translocat Specialist Grp, Avda Suecia 27, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Ferrer, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Biodivers Res Inst IRBIO, Av Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Llaneza, Luis] ARENA Asesores Recursos Nat S L, C Perpetuo Socorro 12,Entlo 2-B, Lugo 27003, Spain; [Ferrer, Miguel] CSIC, Appl Ecol Grp, Estn Biol Dohana, Avda Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Palomero, Guillermo; Ballesteros, Fernando] Fdn Oso Pardo, C San Luis 17,4 A, Santander 39010, Spain; [Oro, Daniel] Consejo Super Invest Cient CEAB, Blanes, Spain",,"Martinez-Abrain, A (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Grp Invest Biol Evolut GIBE, Campus Zapateira S-N, La Coruna 15071, Spain.",a.abrain@udc.es,"Llaneza, Luis/R-3597-2018; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/G-4522-2016","Llaneza, Luis/0000-0001-9529-5128; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/0000-0001-8009-4331",Xunta de Galicia (Programa de Investigacion Competitiva del Sistema Universitario Gallego) [ED431C 2018/57]; Fundacio Barcelona Zoo; Ajuntament de Barcelona; MINUARTIA Estudis Ambientals,"We are grateful to S.

There are costs to antipredator defenses and the strength of prey responses to cues of predation likely depends on both the perceived level of risk and food availability. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the costs of nonlethal trait-mediated interactions impacting larvae can have carryover effects that alter life-history traits, adult characteristics, and ultimately population dynamics. The effects of Toxorhynchites rutilus kairomones and chemical alarm cues on Aedes triseriatus were assessed in a two-level factorial design manipulating nutrient level (low or high) and chemical cues of predation (present or absent). Nonlethal chemical cues of predation significantly decreased female survivorship and significantly decreased female size. Females emerged as adults significantly earlier when exposed to predation cues when there was high nutrient availability. When raised in the low nutrient treatment and exposed to predator cues, adult females had 2.1 times the hazard of death compared to high nutrient-no predator cues. Females raised in the high nutrient and predator cue treatment blood fed sooner than did females from other combinations. Fear of predation can substantially alter prey life-history traits and behavior, which can cascade into dramatic population, community, and ecosystem effects. Exposure to predator cues significantly decreased the estimated cohort rate of increase, potentially altering the expected population density of the next generation.","[Ower, Geoffrey D.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Ower, Geoffrey D.] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL USA",,"Ower, GD (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",gdower@illinois.edu,,"Ower, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9770-2345; Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1R15AI094322-01A1],"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Grant/Award Number: 1R15AI094322-01A1",,78,5,5,5,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Some exploit resources and protection provided by close proximity to people, while others learn to avoid people all together. In this study, we sought to test whether individuals from a population of eastern grey kangaroos altered grouping and spacing behaviour in response to human presence, depending upon whether the intent and actions of those people were benign or harmful. Under harmful conditions, kangaroos failed to form larger groups when far from cover, however, this typical antipredator grouping behaviour persisted when human disturbances were benign. These differences in grouping and spacing behaviour suggest that kangaroos can exhibit bidirectional behavioural plasticity at fine scales, a trait that may confer adaptive advantages when sharing landscapes with humans. Abstract Sharing landscapes with humans is an increasingly fraught challenge for wildlife across the globe. While some species benefit from humans by exploiting novel opportunities (e.g., provision of resources or removal of competitors or predators), many wildlife experience harmful effects, either directly through persecution or indirectly through loss of habitat. Consequently, some species have been shown to be attracted to human presence while others avoid us. For any given population of a single species, though, the question of whether they can recognise and change their response to human presence depending on the type of human actions (i.e., either positive or negative) has received little attention to date. In this study, we chose to examine the behavioural plasticity within a single population of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) to both positive and negative human activity. Within a relatively small and contiguous landscape, we identified areas where kangaroos experience a combination of either low and high frequencies of benign and harmful human disturbances. From six sampling sessions over five months, we found that density and group sizes were higher where humans acted benignly towards them, and that these groups had higher representations of sub-adults and juveniles than where humans had harmful intentions. Importantly, we found that the vital antipredator strategy of increasing group size with distance from cover was not detectable at sites with low and high levels of harm. Our findings suggest that these kangaroos are recognising and adjusting their behavioural response to humans at fine spatial scales, a plasticity trait that may be key to the survival of these species in human dominated landscapes.","[Austin, Caitlin M.; Ramp, Daniel] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",,"Austin, CM (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",Caitlin.Austin@uts.edu.au; Daniel.Ramp@uts.edu.au,"Ramp, Daniel/C-3692-2008","Ramp, Daniel/0000-0003-3202-9898",Detroit Zoological Society; UTS Postgraduate Research Scholarship,This project was funded by Detroit Zoological Society and C.M.A was supported by a UTS Postgraduate Research Scholarship.,,75,5,5,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAY,2019,9,5,,,,,,,244,10.3390/ani9050244,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,IC4UY,WOS:000470963400048,31096679,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-04-19,

In the Caribbean, introduced mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) are an important diurnal predator of the nests of critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata). We asked whether daytime visitor activity could benefit hawksbills by reducing mongoose activity in nesting habitat. We used track monitoring sites to measure how mongooses alter their space use in response to fluctuating human beach use and availability of hawksbill nests, and we estimated the indirect impact of human disturbance on nest predation for 5 years of hawksbill nesting. Human activity substantially decreased mongoose use of nesting habitat. Mongoose activity increased with abundance of nests and was lower at the edge than the interior of patches of beach vegetation, but neither factor altered relative sensitivity to disturbance. We estimated that, in addition to deterring mongooses from accessing nests on the open beach, human activity has the potential to reduce predation of nests in vegetation by up to 56% at our site, with the greatest per capita impact at low (<50) visitor numbers. Many forms of human activity negatively affect sea turtles, but our study indicates that there are positive aspects of daytime use of nesting beaches. Optimizing the trade-off between positive and negative impacts of disturbance could provide a useful approach for regulating tourist activity in critical habitat for threatened species.

Gulls readily exploit anthropogenic food sources (e.g. rubbish dumps and other places of human refuse) and often 'steal' food from people eating out of doors. Their behaviour suggests that gulls perceive little risk around people and so we examined whether opportunity costs, that is access to anthropogenic food sources, influence risk monitoring and escape responses in Silver Gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) around outdoor restaurants ('food' sites), where the gulls would scavenge food from people. We recorded alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) and compared them with nearby sites where the same cohort of gulls was not interacting with people ('no-food' sites). We used two approach speeds (with the prediction that gulls would take greater efforts to avoid a potential predation threat when approached at speed). Gulls foraging at food sites had lower AD and FID than those approached at no-food sites. They were not simply ignoring the person, as they demonstrated longer AD when approached at speed but no difference in FID and therefore appeared to be responding to a small geographic scale 'behavioural footprint' of anthropogenic influences. Our study also challenges universality of the assumption that starting distance is necessarily correlated with FID, especially in sites where there are many people that animals are constantly monitoring - to determine the risk they represent as well as the likelihood of potential food opportunities.","[Fleming, Patricia A.] Murdoch Univ, Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Bateman, Philip W.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia",,"Fleming, PA (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.; Bateman, PW (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia.",t.fleming@murdoch.edu.au; Bill.bateman@curtin.edu.au,"Bateman, Bill/B-7751-2019","Bateman, Bill/0000-0002-3036-5479; Fleming, Patricia/0000-0002-0626-3851",University of Pretoria; Murdoch University; Murdoch University Animal Ethics Committee [O2549/13],We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the University of Pretoria and Murdoch University.

In general, fear is elicited when threat is proximal, while anxiety is a response to threat that is distal and uncertain. This threat gradient model suggests that fear and anxiety involve non-overlapping neural circuitry, yet few behavioral paradigms exist that elicit both states. We studied avoid-approach conflict in rats that were behaving in a predator-inhabited foraging arena task that involved tangible threat and reward incentives. In the task, rats exhibited a variety of both fearful and anxious behaviors corresponding to proximal and distal threat, respectively. We then administered ethanol or diazepam to the rats in order to study how anxiolytics affected these fear and anxiety behaviors. We discovered that both ethanol and diazepam attenuated proximal-threat fear-like behaviors. Furthermore, we found that diazepam, but not ethanol, increased distal-threat anxiety-like behavior but also made rats less risk-averse.

This recolonization has provided an opportunity to study behavioral responses of moose (Alces alces) to wolves. We used satellite telemetry locations from collared moose and wolves to determine whether moose habitat use was affected by predation risk based on wolf use distributions. Moose habitat use was influenced by reproductive status and time of day and showed a different selection pattern between winter and summer, but there was weak evidence that moose habitat use depended on predation risk. The seemingly weak response may have several underlying explanations that are not mutually exclusive from the long term absence of non-human predation pressure: intensive harvest by humans during the last century is more important than wolf predation as an influence on moose behavior; moose have not adapted to recolonizing wolves; and responses may include other behavioral adaptations or occur at finer temporal and spatial levels than investigated.","[Nicholson, Kerry L.; Milleret, Cyril; Mansson, Johan; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, S-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Milleret, Cyril] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Forestry & Wildlife Management, N-2480 Evenstad, Koppang, Norway",,"Nicholson, KL (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, S-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden.",kernicholson@yahoo.com,,"Milleret, Cyril/0000-0002-8563-981X; Mansson, Johan/0000-0002-5189-2091",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Marie-Claire Cronstedts Stiftelse; Carl Tryggers Stiftelse,"We are indebted to J.M.

In non-human species, female cues can also increase mate risk taking, reducing their responses to predator threat. As estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ER alpha and ER beta) are involved in the mediation of social and sexual responses, we investigated their roles in determining the effects of female-associated cues on mate risk taking. We examined the effects of brief pre-exposure to the odors of either a novel or familiar estrous female on the avoidance of, and aversive responses to, predator threat (cat odor) in ER alpha and ER beta wild type (alpha ERWT, beta ERWT) and gene-deleted (knockout, alpha ERKO, beta ERKO) mate mice. Exposure of alpha ERWT and alpha ERWT mates to the odors of a novel, but not a familiar, estrous female mouse resulted in enhanced risk taking with the mates displaying reduced avoidance of, and analgesic responses to, cat odor. In contrast, alpha ERKO mate mice failed to show any changes in risk taking, while beta ERKO mates, although displaying greater risk taking, did not distinguish between novel and familiar females, displaying similarly reduced avoidance responses to cat odor after exposure to either a novel or familiar female odor. These findings indicate that the gene for ER alpha is associated with the sexual mechanisms (response to estrous female) and the genes for ER beta and ER alpha with the social (recognition of novel female) mechanisms underlying the effects of female cues on mate risk taking.

Animals migrating outside of protected areas can be exposed to greater human pressure, and this effect can be stronger when humans are perceived to be a predation risk, such as during hunting seasons. Using four consecutive years of satellite telemetry data (n = 138 migration events), we compared habitat selection, movement, and behavior of a large partially migratory herbivore while migrating through a heterogeneous landscape in spring and fall. We tested the hypothesis that fall hunting exacerbates the response of a large herbivore exposed to human disturbance while migrating through a road network. All elk (Cervus elaphus) selected greater forest cover, reduced movement rates, and avoided roads during fall-day than in any other season or time of day. Avoidance of roads was reduced during spring at night, for example, the time period of no hunting with fewest people on roads. Elk using stopovers in fall displayed different seasonal and diurnal behaviors between sexes in response to the disturbance. Females used steeper terrain during fall-day and males did not use this strategy in fall. Male avoidance of roads was much stronger than females during fall-day and males were less likely to cross a road during fall. Such responses are probably linked to higher hunting pressure on males vs. females. Finally, we found that elk spent more time feeding during spring migration compared to the fall migration and elk vigilance was > 3 times higher in the fall hunting season. Our results provide insights into the effect of fear of humans on the ecology of both sexes of a migrating large herbivore when using stopovers. Such changes in behavior and stopover use might affect animal fitness by decreasing foraging, cause displacement from high-quality habitats, or affect the permeability of migration route stopovers.","[Paton, Dale G.] Anatum Ecol Ltd, Crowsnest Pass, AB T0K 0E0, Canada; [Ciuti, Simone] Univ Freiburg, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Quinn, Michael] Mt Royal Univ, Res Scholarship & Community Engagement, Calgary, AB T3E 6K6, Canada; [Boyce, Mark S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada",,"Ciuti, S (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",simone.ciuti@biom.uni-freiburg.de,"Boyce, Mark S/A-2620-2014; Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013","Boyce, Mark S/0000-0001-5811-325X; Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC-CRD)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Shell Canada Limited; Alberta Conservation Association (Grant Eligible Conservation Fund); Alberta Sustainable Resource Development; Safari Club International; Alberta Parks; Canada Parks (Waterton Lakes National Park),"We thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC-CRD), Shell Canada Limited, Alberta Conservation Association (Grant Eligible Conservation Fund), Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, Safari Club International, Alberta Parks, and Canada Parks (Waterton Lakes National Park) for funding and support.

Although NCEs are recognized as being important across disparate ecosystems, the factors influencing their strength and importance remain poorly understood. Ecological context, such as time of day, predator identity, and prey condition, may modify how prey species perceive and respond to risk, thereby altering NCEs. To investigate how predator identity affects foraging of herbivorous coral reef fishes, we simulated predation risk using fiberglass models of two predator species (grouper Mycteroperca bonaci and barracuda Sphyraena barracuda) with different hunting modes. We quantified how predation risk alters herbivory rates across space (distance from predator) and time (dawn, mid-day, and dusk) to examine how prey reconciles the conflicting demands of avoiding predation vs. foraging. When we averaged the effect of both predators across space and time, they suppressed herbivory similarly. Yet, they altered feeding differently depending on time of day and distance from the model. Although feeding increased strongly with increasing distance from the predators particularly during dawn, we found that the barracuda model suppressed herbivory more strongly than the grouper model during mid-day. We suggest that prey hunger level and differences in predator hunting modes could influence these patterns. Understanding how context mediates NCEs provides insight into the emergent effects of predator-prey interactions on food webs. These insights have broad implications for understanding how anthropogenic alterations to predator abundances can affect the spatial and temporal dynamics of important ecosystem processes.","[Catano, Laura B.; Barton, Mark B.; Boswell, Kevin M.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Catano, Laura B.] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Burkepile, Deron E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Catano, LB (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.; Catano, LB (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",catanol@umsl.edu,"Boswell, Kevin M./B-6380-2016; Barton, Mark/V-7772-2019","Boswell, Kevin M./0000-0002-2037-1541; ",NOAA Coral Reef Conservation ProgramNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Florida International University; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA10OAR4320143],"Funding for this work was provided by an NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program grant to D.E.B and B.I.

We conducted two experiments to study the foraging decisions of white-browed sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser mahali). The first experiment manipulated both direct and indirect cues in a feeding array by simultaneously placing feeding stations at different distances from humans (to manipulate direct risk) and from protective cover (to manipulate indirect risk). Weaver foraging was influenced more by indirect risk than by direct risk. The second experiment aimed to determine if weaver's indirect risk assessment was sensitive to variation in benefits. We set two feeding stations at different distances from cover but the same distance from the human observers and systematically increased the amount of food at the station farther from cover. Weavers far from cover initially foraged at higher rates than those close to cover, but the addition of food reduced the foraging rate. Together, our results illustrate that weaver foraging decisions are sensitive to variation in risk and that indirect cues are relatively more important than direct cues.","[Fong, Tracy E.; DeLong, Travis W.; Hogan, Sarah B.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244",UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; UCLA Office of Instructional Development; Lida Scott Brown Endowment,"We are extremely thankful to Director Margaret Kinnaird, Christopher Odhiambo, and the staff of Mpala who welcomed us and facilitated our work, and Mathew Namoni and Lucretia Olson for help in the field and laboratory.

To test the hypothesis that risk of predation plays a key role in the development of sexual segregation (habitat segregation) in this species, compositions and locations of groups of ibex were recorded from February 2003 to October 2004. Individual fixes of marked adult males and females in the Gran Paradiso National Park in Italy were collected monthly over a 4-year period (January 2000-December 2003). Distances were measured between each location and the nearest refuge area (rocky slopes), and between each location and the nearest source of disturbance (roads and hiking trails). Group size was not related to distances from refuge areas or from sources of disturbance, but sex, a e, and weaning played a key role in spatial segregation. During the period of rut, females 1 9 C, kept nearer to rocky slopes and further from hiking trails than males. The presence of young also influenced the spatial behavior of females: mothers made use of refuge areas more frequently and of areas near hiking trails less frequently than other females. In contrast, no difference between the spatial behaviors of pregnant and nonpregnant females was recorded in spring. Age played an important role in space use by males, but not by females. Young males (2-5 years) stayed closer to rocks than did middle-aged males (6-11 years), and both stayed closer to rocks than did adult males (> I I years). Adult males stayed closer to hiking trails than middle-aged males; likewise, the latter stayed closer to hiking trails than young males. Males stayed near areas with human presence, like]v because of good foraging opportunities. Although our findings do not exclude other explanations, they support the reproductive strategy-predation risk hypothesis. Moreover, predation risk was shown as an important factor leading to both sexual and age segregation in males.","[Grignolio, Stefano; Rossi, Iva; Apollonio, Marco] Univ Sassari, Dept Zool & Evolut Genet, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Bassano, Bruno] Gran Paradiso Natl Park, Alpine Wildlife Res Ctr, I-10123 Turin, Italy",,"Apollonio, M (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dept Zool & Evolut Genet, Via Muroni 25, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",marcoapo@uniss.it,"Grignolio, Stefano/AAS-2988-2020","Grignolio, Stefano/0000-0002-0786-2004",,,,59,49,52,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

Here we experimentally assessed the role of social and ecological traits on the expression of mobbing behavior in a bird community in SE Brazil (n = 157 species). We exposed birds to models of two morphologically similar diurnal owls that pose different risks, and assessed which species engaged in mobbing. Among those that mobbed, we evaluated how they adjusted their mobbing behavior depending on the predator type. We tested the hypothesis that only species that are at risk and can afford to mob engage in this antipredator behavior. We found that species that engaged in mobbing are in the body mass range of potential prey, forage in the understory or in the canopy, and form flocks. A species' social system did not influence its mobbing behavior. Furthermore, species that engaged in mobbing formed larger mobbing assemblages when facing a high-risk predator, but mobbed more intensely when facing a low-risk predator. Our findings support our predictions, namely that the expression of mobbing is limited by its costs.","[Ribeiro da Cunha, Filipe Cristovao; Griesser, Michael] Univ Zurich, Dept Anthropol, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ribeiro da Cunha, Filipe Cristovao] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Inst Ciencias Exatas & Biol, Campus Ouro Preto,R Diogo Vasconcelos 122, BR-35400000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil; [Rodrigues Fontenelle, Julio Cesar] Inst Fed Minas Gerais, Lab Pesquisas Ambientais, Campus Ouro Preto,Rua Pandia Calogeras, BR-35400000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil; [Griesser, Michael] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland",,"da Cunha, FCR (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Anthropol, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.; da Cunha, FCR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Inst Ciencias Exatas & Biol, Campus Ouro Preto,R Diogo Vasconcelos 122, BR-35400000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil.",filipe.cunha@uzh.ch,"Griesser, Michael/J-4542-2012","Griesser, Michael/0000-0002-2220-2637","Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Science Without Boarders/Capes [BEX 8920133]; Arbeitsgemeinschaft Eulenschutz im Landkreis Ludwigsburg; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PPOOP3_123520, PP00P3_150752)]; National Science Centre, Poland, through the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Marie Sklodowska-Curie) [665778]","F.C.R.C. received funding from Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Science Without Boarders/Capes (BEX 8920133), and Arbeitsgemeinschaft Eulenschutz im Landkreis Ludwigsburg.

The goals of this study were to investigate the short-term toxicity of cadmium (Cd) to wild Pomatochistus microps juveniles, the potential modulation of acute Cd toxicity by 1-5 mu m polyethylene MPs in this species, and possible differences of sensitivity to Cd and MPs-Cd mixtures between juveniles from two distinct wild populations. Juveniles were collected in the estuaries of Minho (M-est) and Lima (L-est) Rivers (NW Portugal). One 96 h bioassay with M-est juveniles and another one with L-est juveniles were carried out in laboratory conditions. Each bioassay had 12 treatments: control, 5 Cd concentrations, 1 MPs concentration, and 5 MPs-Cd mixtures. No significant differences in Cd-induced mortality between juveniles from distinct estuaries or between juveniles exposed to Cd alone and those exposed to MPs-Cd mixtures were found. The total 96h LC10 and LC50 of Cd alone were 2 mg/L (95% CI: 0-4 mg/L) and 8 mg/L (95% CI: 2-17 mg/L), respectively. Cd alone significantly decreased the post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP) of M-est (>= 6 mg/L) and L-est juveniles (>= 3 mg/L), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of M-est juveniles (13 mg/L). MPs alone (0.14 mg/L) significantly reduced the PEPP and AChE activity of L-est juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. MPs-Cd mixtures (3-13 mg/L of Cd + 0.14 mg/L of MPs) significantly inhibited the PEPP of juveniles from both estuaries and AChE of L-est estuary juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. Evidences of toxicological interactions, namely antagonism, between MPs and Cd were found. Overall, the results indicate that MPs modulated the sub-lethal toxic effects of Cd in wild P. microps juveniles, especially neurotoxicity. Moreover, the environmental conditions of the natural habitats to which juveniles were exposed during pre-developmental phases influence the sub-lethal toxicity of Cd, MPs, and their mixtures. The implications to environmental and human risk assessment are discussed and further research is needed.","[Miranda, Tiago; Vieira, Luis R.; Guilhermino, Lucia] Univ Porto, ICBAS Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Populat Study, Lab Ecotoxicol ECOTOX, P-4050313 Porto, Portugal; [Miranda, Tiago; Vieira, Luis R.; Guilhermino, Lucia] Univ Porto, CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, Res Team Ecotoxicol Stress Ecol & Environm Hlth E, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal",,"Guilhermino, L (corresponding author), Univ Porto, ICBAS Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Populat Study, Lab Ecotoxicol ECOTOX, P-4050313 Porto, Portugal.; Guilhermino, L (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, Res Team Ecotoxicol Stress Ecol & Environm Hlth E, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal.",lguilher@icbas.up.pt,"Vieira, Luis R./J-4605-2013; Vieira, Luis R/H-1957-2012; Miranda, Tiago/ABE-2391-2020","Vieira, Luis R./0000-0002-8218-619X; Vieira, Luis R/0000-0002-8218-619X; Guilhermino, Lucia/0000-0002-1009-8967","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P., Portugal (FCT) [JPIOCEANS/0004/2015, PTDC/MAR-PRO/1851/2014]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the COMPETE 2020 programme through the project PLASTICGLOBAL [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016885]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [UID/Multi/04423/2019]; ERDFEuropean Commission [UID/Multi/04423/2019]","This study was funded by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P., Portugal (FCT) with national funds (FCT/MCTES, orcamento de Estado) through the project EPHEMARE (JPIOCEANS/0004/2015) and the project PLASTICGLOBAL (PTDC/MAR-PRO/1851/2014), and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the COMPETE 2020 programme (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016885) through the project PLASTICGLOBAL.

Thus, elucidating the effects of disturbance on animal behavior, and how this varies among taxonomically similar species with inherently different behaviors and life histories is of value for management and conservation. We evaluated the risk response of three anuran species-southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus), Blanchard's cricket frog (Acris blanchardi), and green tree frog (Hyla cinerea)-to determine how differences in microhabitat use (arboreal vs ground-dwelling) and body size (small vs medium) may play a role in response to a potential threat within a human-altered subtropical forest. Each species responded to risk with both flight and freeze behaviors, however, behaviors were species- and context-specific. As distance to cover increased, southern leopard frogs increased freezing behavior, green tree frogs decreased freezing behavior, and Blanchard's cricket frogs increased flight response. The propensity of green tree frogs to use the canopy of vegetation as refugia, and the small body size of Blanchard's cricket frogs likely led to greater flight response as distance to cover increased, whereas innate reliance on camouflage among southern leopard frogs may place them at greater risk to landscaping, agricultural, and transportation practices in open terrain. As such, arboreal and small-bodied species may inherently be better suited in human altered-landscapes compared to larger, ground-dwelling species. As land-use change continues to modify habitats, understanding how species respond to changes in their environment continues to be of importance, particularly in ecosystems where human-wildlife interactions are expected to increase in frequency.","[Matich, Philip] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Matich, Philip] Sam Houston State Univ, Texas Res Inst Environm Studies, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA; [Schalk, Christopher M.] Stephen F Austin State Univ, Arthur Temple Coll Forestry & Agr, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA",,"Matich, P (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.; Matich, P (corresponding author), Sam Houston State Univ, Texas Res Inst Environm Studies, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA.",pmatich@tamug.edu,"Matich, Philip/AAF-3881-2021",,Office of Research; Office of Research and Sponsored Programs at Stephen F.

However, relevant information is often absent, or difficult to access or contextualise for specific management purposes. We describe 'AvianBuffer', an interactive online tool enabling the estimation of distances at which Australian birds respond fearfully to humans. Users can input species assemblages and determine a 'separation distance' above which the assemblage is predicted to not flee humans. They can also nominate the diversity they wish to minimise disturbance to, or a specific separation distance to obtain an estimate of the diversity that will remain undisturbed. The dataset is based upon flight-initiation distances (FIDs) from 251 Australian bird species (n = 9190 FIDs) and a range of human-associated stimuli. The tool will be of interest to a wide audience including conservation managers, pest managers, policy makers, land-use planners, education and public outreach officers, animal welfare proponents and wildlife ecologists. We discuss possible applications of the data, including the construction of buffers, development of codes of conduct, environmental impact assessments and public outreach. This tool will help balance the growing need for biodiversity conservation in areas where humans can experience nature. The online resource will be expanded in future iterations to include an international database of FIDs of both avian and non-avian species.","[Guay, Patrick-Jean; van Dongen, Wouter F.

Hunters have filled this predatory role, but also can indirectly influence prey species. Indirect behavioral responses can include altered resource selection, space use, or movement. Herein, we developed a controlled study that contained both temporal and spatial risk levels to assess how deer behavior changes relative to temporal periods of risk. Total distance travelled and microrange area over 2-day periods were used to determine the general effects of hunting season on deer spatial behavior. Generally, distance travelled, microrange area, and exploratory behavior decreased during the course of the study, with the greatest decrease occurring during the active 16-day hunting period. Despite potential risk and disturbance from hunters, deer maintained site fidelity to previously established ranges and did not expand microrange areas. These data indicate that deer recognize threats from humans on the landscape and adapt behavioral strategies by minimizing movement and exhibiting high residency times in well-established ranges, factors known to influence harvest susceptibility. This information can be used to assess potential impacts from hunting for management purposes, but also to test the adaptive ability of animals to risk.","[Marantz, Sierra A.; Long, Jed A.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Long, Jed A.; Gee, Kenneth L.] Samuel Roberts Noble Fdn Inc, 2510 Sam Noble Pkwy, Ardmore, OK 73401 USA; [Little, Andrew R.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 East Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Demarais, Stephen] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Gee, Kenneth L.] Oaks & Prairies Joint Venture, 6438 Gene Autry Rd, Gene Autry, OK 73401 USA",,"Long, JA (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",jed.long@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Long, Jed/AAF-2403-2019","Long, Jed/0000-0003-3961-3085; Webb, Stephen/0000-0001-6034-5164","Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc.; Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture at Mississippi State University","This study was funded by The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc., and the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture at Mississippi State University.

Recent studies have revealed that brown bears (Ursus arctos) may kill substantial numbers of reindeer calves (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in forest areas in Sweden. Several authors have suggested that predation risk is an important driver of habitat selection in wild Rangifer populations where predation is a limiting factor, but little is known about these mechanisms in semi-domesticated populations. We examined the habitat selection of female reindeer in relation to spatial and temporal variations in brown bear predation risk on the reindeer calving grounds and evaluated the simultaneous responses of brown bears and reindeer to landscape characteristics. We used GPS data from 110 reindeer years (97 individuals) and 29 brown bear years (19 individuals), from two reindeer herding districts in the forest area of northern Sweden. Our results did not indicate that reindeer alter their behavior in response to spatiotemporal variation in brown bear predation risk, on the scale of the calving range. Instead, we suggest that spatiotemporal behavioral adjustments by brown bears were the main driver of prey-predator interactions in our study system. Contrasting responses by brown bears and reindeer to clear-cuts and young forest indicate that forestry can influence species interactions and possibly yield negative consequences for the reindeer herd. Even if clear-cuts may be beneficial in terms of calf survival, logging activity will eventually cause greater abundance of young regenerating forest, reducing available reindeer habitats and increasing habitat preferred by brown bears. Domestication may have made semi-domesticated reindeer in Fennoscandia less adapted to cope with predators. Areal restrictions, limiting the opportunity for dispersion and escape, possibly make the calves more susceptible to predation. Also, a generally higher population density in semi-domesticated herds compared to wild populations can make dispersion a less efficient strategy and the reindeer calves easier prey. Overall, the lack of ability of the reindeer females to reduce brown bear encounter risk on the scale of the calving range is probably an important reason for the high brown bear predation rates on reindeer calves documented in our study areas.","[Sivertsen, Therese R.; Ahman, Birgitta; Skarin, Anna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Nutr & Management, POB 7024, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Steyaert, Sam M.

This applies particularly to large-bodied, long-lived species with a long evolutionary history of human persecution, such as wild boars (Sus scrofa). Wild boar populations are rapidly expanding throughout natural, agricultural, and urban areas worldwide, thus escalating human-wild boar conflicts. Most of these conflicts are associated with crop and garden damages by foraging wild boars. To study the foraging behavior of wild boars across a gradient of human risk, we evaluated the combined effects of hunting, land use type, and wild boar group size and structure on boar use of feeding devices. We installed corn-supplemented feeding devices in four land-use types and hunting combinations: urban areas with and without hunting, rural areas (namely, agricultural areas with hunting), and nature reserves without hunting. Our results show that rural areas and urban areas were the most important predictors of the wild boars' decision to eat or not and the time it took them to start eating from the moment they arrived at the feeding device (TBE-Time Before Eating). In addition, our study suggests that the TBEs of urban boars were significantly lower compared to boars from nature reserves. We further found that TBEs of urban boars were significantly lower than TBEs of boars in nature reserves. Our results suggest that the foraging behavior of wild boars varies spatially, corresponding to the different land-use types. We propose that the readiness of boars to forage in urban areas results from their habituation to human presence and lower perception of risk.","[Davidson, Achiad; Shanas, Uri] Univ Haifa, Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Haifa, Israel; [Malkinson, Dan] Univ Haifa, Geog & Environm Studies, Haifa, Israel; [Malkinson, Dan] Univ Haifa, Shamir Res Inst, Life & Environm Sci, Qatzrin, Israel; [Shanas, Uri] Univ Haifa, Oranim Biol & Environm, Tivon, Israel",,"Davidson, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Evolutionary & Environm Biol, Haifa, Israel.",achiadd@gmail.com,,,Ramat Hanadiv Project of the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation,"We thank Burt Kotler for his invaluable advices, Mika Volov for her valuable contributions to the fieldwork, Yossi Volov for building the feeding devices, and Ben Rosenberg, Yonatan Harael, Liron Tal, Barak Barchiel, and Lishay Ben Yanai, from the INPA for their priceless advice.

The increasing urbanization of the landscape is a major component of global change worldwide. However, it is puzzling that wildlife is selecting anthropogenic habitats despite the availability of apparently high-quality semi-natural (i.e. less intensively modified) habitats. Definitive explanations for this process are still lacking. We have previously suggested that colonization of the urban habitat is initially triggered by ecological processes that take place outside urban areas as a consequence of past rural exodus. Here we present a diverse array of examples of selection of several types of anthropogenic habitat by wildlife in Spain (including transportation infrastructure, human-exclusion areas, urban areas under construction, cities, reservoirs, quarries and landfills) in support of this idea. Wildlife is moving out of its historical ecological refuges and losing fear of harmless urban humans. Mesopredators are rebounding by mesopredator release, due to ceased human persecution, and shrubs and trees are claiming former agricultural habitats. Together, these factors force many species to move to urbanized areas where they find open habitats, food associated with these habitats, and protection against predation. Hence, the classical balance of costs and benefits that takes place once inside urban areas, would actually be a second step of the process of colonization of urban areas. A better understanding of the initial triggers of urban colonization could help us increase the biological value of human-made habitats for wildlife in the future.","[Martinez-Abrain, A.] Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Campus Zapateira S-N, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Ferrer, X.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, Fac Biol, Barcelona, Spain; [Ferrer, X.] Univ Barcelona, Biodivers Res Inst IRBIO, Av Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Jimenez, J.] Generalitat Valenciana, Serv Vida Silvestre, Ciutat Adm 9 Octubre,Torre 1,C Democracia 77, Valencia 46018, Spain; [Fernandez-Calvo, I.

Differential predation risk of mate searching between the sexes is hypothesised to determine which sex invests more effort in mate searching. Although searching by males is prevalent in most animals, in orthopteran insects and some other taxa females physically move to localise signalling males who are predominantly sedentary. Although the two sexes thus share mate searching effort in orthopterans, their behavioural strategies are different and sexual selection theory predicts that signalling males may be following the riskier strategy and incurring higher costs. However, relative levels of risk posed by the two mate searching strategies remain largely unexplored. Hence, we estimated the relative predation risk experienced in natural populations by signalling males and responding females. We did this by quantifying predation risk as a probability of mortality in the context of acoustic communication in a tree cricket, Oecanthus henryi from its ecologically relevant predator, a lynx spider, Peucetia viridans. Spiders may perceive calling in males and movement in females by their ability to detect both airborne acoustic cues and substrate-borne vibratory cues. Probability of mortality was quantified by partitioning it into three spatial components at which crickets and spiders interact, using a combination of extensive field observations and manipulative experiments in a semi-natural setup. We found no differences in predation risk faced by calling males and responding females, supporting the prediction that similar sex-specific costs can explain shared mate searching responsibilities. Our findings therefore suggest that direct benefits offered by males to females upon pair formation may better explain shared mate searching effort between the sexes in orthopterans.","[Torsekar, Viraj R.; Isvaran, Kavita; Balakrishnan, Rohini] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",,"Torsekar, VR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",virajt@iisc.ac.in,"Balakrishnan, Rohini/Z-5881-2019","Torsekar, Viraj/0000-0001-6096-6454","DBT-IISc partnership programme of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of IndiaMinistry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India","We thank the DBT-IISc partnership programme (2012-2017) of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for funding the fieldwork and Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India for funding the research fellowship of VRT.

Here, we recorded the behavioral responses of Antarctic penguins when a stuffed skua and a human approached their nests. We investigated (1) how sympatrically breeding chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins responded to the approaching skua (a real nest predator) and human (a newly introduced intruder) and (2) how the penguin responses varied based on the degree of previous exposure to humans. Our results showed that chinstrap penguins mostly displayed strongly threatening behavior, with physical attacks on both the skua and human. However, gentoo penguins displayed a weaker threatening behavior toward the skua and responded differently to the presence of a human. Many gentoo individuals avoided the human rather than displaying threatening behavior. Furthermore, gentoo penguins near the pathway used by humans exhibited weak responses after 4 weeks of exposures to passers-by, whereas other individuals far from the pathway responded with threatening behavior. These results indicate that chinstrap and gentoo penguins may have different strategies for defending their offspring; gentoo penguins might discriminate between intruder types depending on the degree of danger, whereas chinstrap penguins consistently reacted to any intruders approaching to their nest sites. Our findings suggest that gentoo penguins may become habituated with humans following prior to short-term exposure.","[Lee, Won Young; Jung, Jin-Woo; Choi, Han-Gu; Chung, Hosung; Kim, Jeong-Hoon] Korea Polar Res Inst, Div Polar Life Sci, Incheon 406840, South Korea; [Jung, Jin-Woo; Han, Yeong-Deok; Cho, Sam-Rae] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Gongju, South Korea",,"Kim, JH (corresponding author), Korea Polar Res Inst, Div Polar Life Sci, Incheon 406840, South Korea.",jhkim94@kopri.re.kr,,,"Long-Term Ecological Researches on King George Island to Predict Ecosystem Responses to Climate Change - Korea Polar Research Institute [PE14020]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2014R1A6A3A01008495]","We thank Sungjun Choi, Juntae Kim, Hangyu Kim, Hwayun Kang and Minsoo Jung for sharing field work and Dr. Erik Potvin for the English help.

This study aimed at investigating the relative influence of three types of disturbances (mammalian herbivores, terrestrial threats from ground predators and aerial threats) on the responses by waterbirds at waterpans in Hwange National Park (HNP, Zimbabwe) and adjacent land uses. Thirteen waterpans were monitored during daylight hours between years 2015 and 2017 and responses of waterbirds to the three forms of disturbances were recorded. Logistic regressions revealed that the likelihood of responding was highest after terrestrial threats; with individuals/groups that were initially engaged in non-feeding activities that allowed vigilance, responding the most. Wildfowl species spent significantly longer time flying (compared to waders and generalists), more so in communal areas (CAs) than HNP, and after terrestrial threats compared to aerial threats and herbivore disturbances. We did not find any differences in probability of responding across land uses probably because there is less human disturbance in HNP, but predation risk is high. Further, even though there are less terrestrial predators in CAs, domestic dogs may be maintaining the stimuli. We conclude that terrestrial threats are least tolerated, with species most susceptible to human predation (i.e. wildfowl) losing more time avoiding them. Interestingly, only acute aerial threats induced departure from waterpans. Our findings have a direct implication for waterbird conservation as herbivore and human density in this area are currently increasing.","[Tarakini, Tawanda; Mabika, Innocent] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Sch Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe; [Tarakini, Tawanda; Dakwa, Farisayi; Mundy, Peter] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forest Resources & Wildlife Management, Ascot, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; [Tarakini, Tawanda; Mabika, Innocent; Dakwa, Farisayi; Fritz, Herve] Hwange Natl Pk, CNRS HERD Hwange Environm Res Dev Program Hwange, Dete, Zimbabwe; [Fritz, Herve] Nelson Mandela Univ, George Campus, George, South Africa; [Fritz, Herve] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5558, Villeurbanne, France",,"Tarakini, T (corresponding author), Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Sch Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe.; Tarakini, T (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forest Resources & Wildlife Management, Ascot, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.",ttarakini@cut.ac.zw,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661",Ministere Francais des Affaires Etrangeres through the FSP-RenCaRe project,"We thank the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority for granting us the permission to conduct this study (under permit number 23 (I) (C) (II) 04/2017).

This small vertebrate may be utilized in modeling human brain disorders. One of the major neuropsychiatric conditions still not well understood is abnormally increased fear and anxiety. Zebrafish may be an appropriate organism with which these human diseases can be modeled and their biological mechanisms investigated. Predator induced anxiety paradigms have been suggested as useful methods in translational research. Shoaling fish, such as zebrafish, are known to respond to alarm substances with antipredatory or alarm reactions. However, these responses are not well characterized in zebrafish. In the current paper, we investigate the behavioral responses of zebrafish elicited by its alarm substance. Using observation-based as well as video-tracking aided behavior quantification methods we demonstrate significant alarm substance-induced behavioral changes that are independent of the presence of a predatory fish stimulus. The results suggest that, once refined, the use of alarm substance with zebrafish will allow the development of high throughput behavioral paradigms for drug and mutation screening aimed at the analysis of the biological mechanisms of fear in vertebrates.

The 'predator' stimulus caused a significant fear-induced avoidance of the maze sections closest to where it was presented, indicating an anxiogenic effect. However, WAY 100635 treatment reversed, significantly and dose-dependently, this fear-induced avoidance behavior, while increasing maze exploration. Sedation was not observed.

For terrestrial mammals, one of the principal problems is the risk associated with moving through the environment while foraging. We examined nocturnal patterns of movement of urban-dwelling hedgehogs in relation to (1) the risks posed by predators and motor vehicles and (2) nightly weather patterns. Hedgehogs preferentially utilized the gardens of semidetached and terraced houses. However, females, but not males, avoided the larger back gardens of detached houses, which contain more of the habitat features selected by badgers. This difference in the avoidance of predation risk is probably associated with sex differences in breeding behaviour. Differences in nightly movement patterns were consistent with strategies associated with mating behaviour and the accumulation of fat reserves for hibernation. Hedgehogs also differed in behaviour associated with the risks posed by humans; they avoided actively foraging near roads and road verges, but did not avoid crossing roads per se. They were, however, significantly more active after midnight when there was a marked reduction in vehicle and foot traffic. In particular, responses to increased temperature, which is associated with increased abundance of invertebrate prey, were only observed after midnight. This variation in the timing of bouts of activity would reduce the risks associated with human activities. There were also profound differences in both area ranged and activity between years which warrant further investigation. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Even nuanced aspects of human activity like clothing color affect animal behavior, but we lack an understanding of when and where such effects will occur. The species confidence hypothesis posits that birds are attracted to colors found on their bodies and repelled by non-body colors. Here, we extend this hypothesis taxonomically and conceptually to test whether this pattern is applicable in a non-avian reptile and to suggest that species should respond less fearfully to their sexually-selected signaling color. Responses to clothing color could also be impacted by habituation to humans, so we examine whether behavior varied between areas with low and high human activity. We quantified the effects of four T-shirt colors on flight initiation distances (FID) and on the ease of capture in western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), and we accounted for detectability against the background environment. We found no differences in lizard behavior between sites. However, lizards tolerated the closest approaches and were most likely to be captured when approached with the T-shirt that resembled their sexually-selected signaling color. Because changes in individual behavior affect fitness, choice of clothing color by people, including tourists, hikers, and researchers, could impact wildlife populations and research outcomes.","[Putman, Breanna J.; Drury, Jonathan P.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Putman, Breanna J.; Pauly, Gregory B.] Nat Hist Museum Angeles Cty, Sect Herpetol, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Putman, Breanna J.; Pauly, Gregory B.] Nat Hist Museum Angeles Cty, Urban Nat Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",,"Putman, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Putman, BJ (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Angeles Cty, Sect Herpetol, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.; Putman, BJ (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Angeles Cty, Urban Nat Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",putman.bree@gmail.com,,"Pauly, Gregory/0000-0002-2381-2576; Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1611562],"Support was provided by a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology from the National Science Foundation (DBI-1611562 to BJP; https://www.nsf.gov/).

However, the amygdala, a brain area repeatedly implicated in fear and anxiety processes, is known to contain large numbers of SP-containing neurons and SP receptors. Several studies have implicated SP neurotransmission within the amygdala in anxiety processes. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of site-specific infusions of an SP receptor antagonist, GR 82334, on conditioned fear responses using the fear-potentiated startle paradigm. GR 82334 infusion into the basolateral (BLA) or the medial (MeA) nuclei of the amygdala, but not into the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), dose dependently reduced fear-potentiated startle. Similar effects were obtained with GR 82334 infusion into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), to which the MeA projects, and into the rostral dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG), to which the VMH projects, but not into the deep layers of the superior colliculus/deep mesencephalic nucleus (dSC/DpMe), an output of the CeA previously shown to be important for fear-potentiated startle. Consistent with previous findings, infusion of the AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX, into the dSC/DpMe, but not into the PAG, did disrupt fear-potentiated startle. These findings suggest that multiple outputs from the amygdala play a critical role in fear-potentiated startle and that SP plays a critical, probably modulatory role, in the MeA to VMH to PAG to the startle pathway based on these and data from others.","[Zhao, Zuowei; Yang, Yong; Walker, David L.; Davis, Michael] Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Walker, David L.; Davis, Michael] Emory Univ, Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Davis, M (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Sch Med, 954 Gatewood Rd, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",mdavis4@emory.edu,,,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH47840, MH57250, MH59906]; Science and Technology CenterScience and Technology Development Fund (STDF) [IBN-9876754]; Yerkes Base; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH047840, R01MH057250, R01MH059906, R01MH047840] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grants MH47840, MH57250, and MH59906; the Science and Technology Center (the Center for Behavioral Neuroscience of the National Science Foundation under Agreement no.

However, the act of trapping provides two types of conditional benefits (food from the bait when hungry, and refuge from a predator when threatened) against one type of drawback (confinement). Our understanding of how animals assess the two benefits against the lone risk determines how we interpret classic field studies in chemical ecology and wildlife management. Here, we studied wood mice responses to these risks and rewards of field trapping by examining experience through recapture and faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) as a physiological response indicator. Wood mice were live-trapped in two different plots subjected to two distinct phases: phase 1, absence of predator cues, and phase 2, in which traps were treated with red fox faeces. During phase 1, the recapture percentage was lower indicating that mice avoided traps while FCM levels in recaptured mice were higher. On the contrary, during phase 2, despite the total number of captures was lower we found an increase in the recapture percentage and FCM levels did not increase in recaptured mice. Our results suggest that under increased risk perception traps could be likely considered as a suitable shelter and thus, for some individuals the benefits of traps may outweigh their risks. In addition, we discovered that the effects of combining two stressors do not result in the addition of the response originated by each factor separately.","[Hernandez, M.

Novel changes to the foodscape, such as human disturbance, can alter behavioral decisions that favor avoidance of perceived risk over food acquisition. Although behavioral changes and population declines often coincide with the introduction of human disturbance, the link(s) between behavior and population trajectory are difficult to elucidate. To identify a pathway by which human disturbance may affect ungulate populations, we tested the Behaviorally Mediated Forage-Loss Hypothesis, wherein behavioral avoidance is predicted to reduce use of available forage adjacent to disturbance. We used GPS collar data collected from migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to evaluate habitat selection, movement patterns, and time-budgeting behavior in response to varying levels of forage availability and human disturbance in three different populations exposed to a gradient of energy development. Subsequently, we linked animal behavior with measured use of forage relative to human disturbance, forage availability, and quality. Mule deer avoided human disturbance at both home range and winter range scales, but showed negligible differences in vigilance rates at the site level. Use of the primary winter forage, sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), increased as production of new annual growth increased but use decreased with proximity to disturbance. Consequently, avoidance of human disturbance prompted loss of otherwise available forage, resulting in indirect habitat loss that was 4.6-times greater than direct habitat loss from roads, well pads, and other infrastructure. The multiplicative effects of indirect habitat loss, as mediated by behavior, impaired use of the foodscape by reducing the amount of available forage for mule deer, a consequence of which may be winter ranges that support fewer animals than they did before development.","[Dwinnell, Samantha P.

Changes to their populations reverberate through ecological communities; consequently their widespread decline in numbers and shrinking distribution due to human persecution has brought about a loss and reconfiguration of biological diversity in many systems. Although many large carnivore populations are now under conservation-minded management, political and economic constraints make compromises necessary. A common compromise is to permit limited harvests, with the premise of sustainability and the objective to increase tolerance and funding for carnivore recovery and conservation. Here we question whether a large carnivore that has to look over its shoulder for human hunters can still fully perform its ecological role at the apex of a trophic system. We use information about carnivore behavior, ecology, trophic interactions, and the effects of human exploitation to argue that exploitation of large carnivores, even if sustainable numerically, undermines the commonly expressed rationale for their conservation, namely the restoration and preservation of ecosystem functionality. Our argument centers around (i) the necessity of behavioral adjustments in large carnivores to anthropomorphic risk, which may limit their contribution to the landscape of fear, and (ii) the observation that many of the same features that put large carnivores at the apex of trophic systems also make them vulnerable to human exploitation and persecution, with implicit consequences for their ecological functionality and evolution. Although hunting large carnivores can improve public acceptance, managers must be aware of the trade-offs. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Predation theory, as applied to herbivores, was used to describe alternative functional responses predicted by each hypothesis. Further, we postulated that elk behavioral patterns resulting from predation risk could also influence aspen herbivory. We tested predictions by sampling aspen density and browsing conditions in spatially separate watersheds in the Canadian Rockies, with three areas in each of three elk density levels (<2, 2-4, >4 elk/km(2)), and in each of four tree cover classes: recently disturbed (<25 years ago), and low, moderate, and high. Plot elk use was indexed with pellet group counts classed by habitat patch type, aspen condition (open or thicket), and different distances from trails or park boundaries used by predators, hunters, or park visitors. The herbivory rate on aspen saplings (>1 m height and <1 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) fitted the predictions of a Type 2 functional response (e.g. increased rate of herbivory with decreased sapling density). The Type 2 response appeared to result from low elk use in dense aspen thickets when predation risk is high. An interaction effect in the tree cover x elk density factorial analysis indicated that recent disturbances (<25 years) have incrementally increased the number of aspen saplings, but did not cause a major shift to an abundant sapling state in areas of high and moderate elk density. These results best supported the predictions of the low elk herbivory hypothesis. Anthropogenic burning combined with human and carnivore predation effects on elk (behavioral and numeric) appeared to be important in aspen's long-term persistence, and its recent decline.

The nature and strength of these non-consumptive effects at the population level can be equivalent, or even greater, than consumptive effects. Many prey species have evolved defence mechanisms that are induced by predation risk. These inducible defences can be morphological or behavioural in nature. Extensive research has detected these defences in predator-prey communities across freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Among this vast research however, an influential portion of these systems has not been widely considered. Humans inhabit a level in trophic systems above apex predators. In that position, humans have been referred to as ahyperkeystoneorsuper predatorspecies as they have shown a capacity to consume animals at rates many times higher than any other non-human species. However, the extent to which humans induce adaptive defences in animals is not as clear. Systems involving large mammals may be particularly well-suited for the study of human-induced defences given that these species have been disproportionately exploited (for food and competition) over evolutionary time by humans. To begin this process we first had to examine the context in which large mammals could adaptively evolve inducible defences in relation to human lethality. With the plausibility of these conditions satisfied, we then conducted an extensive review to document the inducible defences that have been detected in large mammals. All of the 187 studies reviewed documented the behavioural plasticity of large mammals to human lethality. No morphological adaptive defences were detected. However, the extent to which the observed behavioural plasticity of large mammals is representative of adaptive inducible defences remains unclear because the fitness trade-offs (i.e. costs), an integral condition for inducible defences to evolve, were implied rather than quantified among close to 92% of this research. We make recommendations for renewed ingenuity in the development of field experiments that can quantify these costs and discuss the implications of human lethality on the ecology, conservation and management of large mammals.

Human globalisation has further expanded its range, so that today they are found on most continents. Despite their abundance, knowledge of fox behaviour remains limited. Most studies have observed foxes either in captivity or in their native range where both they and their predators are killed by humans. We conducted a behavioural study on foxes outside of their native range in Australia, at a unique location where all wildlife are protected. We developed an ethogram to explore fox behaviour at resource points shared with a potentially deadly apex predator, the dingo. We were surprised to find that foxes were in a confident state more often than in a cautious state, even leaving territorial markings over those of dingoes. One possible explanation for the confidence of foxes is that the social stability of both foxes and dingoes makes their world more predictable. Abstract: The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a widespread and ecologically significant terrestrial mesopredator, that has expanded its range with human globalisation. Despite this, we know relatively little about their behaviour under the wide range of ecological conditions they experience, particularly how they navigate the risk of encounters with apex predators. We conducted the first ethological study of foxes outside their historic native range, in Australia, where both the foxes and their main predator were protected from human hunting. Using remote camera traps, we recorded foxes visiting key resource points regularly utilised by territorial dingoes (Canis dingo), their local apex predator, in the Painted Desert, South Australia. We constructed an ethogram sensitive to a range of behaviours and attitudes. Since foxes are suppressed by dingoes, we expected that the foxes would primarily be in a cautious state. In contrast, we found that foxes were in a confident state most of the time. Where human hunting is absent, social stability of predators may increase predictability and therefore decrease fear.","[Wooster, Eamonn; Wallach, Arian D.; Ramp, Daniel] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, POB 123, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia",,"Wooster, E (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, POB 123, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",Eamonn.Wooster@uts.edu.au; Arian.Wallach@uts.edu.au; Daniel.Ramp@uts.edu.au,"Wallach, Arian D./ABC-9215-2020; Ramp, Daniel/C-3692-2008","Wallach, Arian D./0000-0002-6640-3887; Ramp, Daniel/0000-0003-3202-9898; Wooster, Eamonn/0000-0002-2907-4076",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP180100272],This study was funded by Australian Research Council grant number DP180100272.,,60,3,3,0,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,NOV,2019,9,11,,,,,,,907,10.3390/ani9110907,,,14,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,JV3XT,WOS:000502299900053,31683979,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-19,

Most previous studies have shown enhanced boldness manifested as changes in responses to humans approaching, such as reductions in flight initiation distance (FID). However, this includes two confounding factors related to boldness, that is, reduction of vigilance and habituation to humans. Confounding these totally different processes could lead to our misunderstanding of urban adaptation and how to properly manage urban wildlife. Here, we propose a simple framework to separate the two processes using two flight distance measures toward different approaching threats. We considered that the distance at which targeted individuals noticed an approaching object (i.e., alert distance, AD) was related to vigilance, whereas FID represented risk assessment, which is related to habituation. We applied a predictive framework using AD and FID to Eurasian red squirrels' responses to multiple threats of different risk levels (i.e., humans, model predators, and novel objects). AD was shorter in urban individuals compared with rural ones but not different among the approaching objects. FID was shorter in urban individuals and also varied among the objects with the shortest FID toward humans, whereas rural individuals showed similar FID to the different objects. These results suggest that, although urban individuals showed reduced vigilance, they could still assess different risk levels. Our framework can easily be applied to many animals and could significantly improve our understanding of wild animals' adaptations to urban environments.","[Uchida, Kenta; Koizumi, Itsuro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Suzuki, Kei K.; Shimamoto, Tatsuki; Yanagawa, Hisashi] Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Lab Wildlife Ecol, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan; [Suzuki, Kei K.] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyushu Res Ctr, Chuo Ku, 4-11-16 Kurokami, Kumamoto, Kumamoto 8600862, Japan; [Shimamoto, Tatsuki] Nippon Vet & Life Sci Univ, Sch Vet Nursing & Technol, Fac Vet Sci, Musashino, Tokyo 1808602, Japan; [Koizumi, Itsuro] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan",,"Uchida, K; Koizumi, I (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.; Koizumi, I (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",k.uchida@ees.hokudai.ac.jp; itsuro@ees.hokudai.ac.jp,"Uchida, Kenta/AAJ-5940-2021","Suzuki, Kei/0000-0003-0709-6706; Uchida, Kenta/0000-0001-7998-1363","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP17J04255]",This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowship (JP17J04255 to KU).,,49,22,23,12,92,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Whether perceived risk corresponds with actual fitness outcomes, however, remains an important open question. We simultaneously measured how habitat changes due to a common invasive grass (cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum) affected the perceived risk, habitat selection, and apparent survival of a small mammal, enabling us to assess how well perceived risk influenced important behaviors and reflected actual risk. We measured perceived risk by nocturnal rodents using a giving-up density foraging experiment with paired shrub (safe) and open (risky) foraging trays in cheatgrass and native habitats. We also evaluated microhabitat selection across a cheatgrass gradient as an additional assay of perceived risk and behavioral responses for deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) at two spatial scales of habitat availability. Finally, we used mark-recapture analysis to quantify deer mouse apparent survival across a cheatgrass gradient while accounting for detection probability and other habitat features. In the foraging experiment, shrubs were more important as protective cover in cheatgrass-dominated habitats, suggesting that cheatgrass increased perceived predation risk. Additionally, deer mice avoided cheatgrass and selected shrubs, and marginally avoided native grass, at two spatial scales. Deer mouse apparent survival varied with a cheatgrass-shrub interaction, corresponding with our foraging experiment results, and providing a rare example of a native plant mediating the effects of an invasive plant on wildlife. By synthesizing the results of three individual lines of evidence (foraging behavior, habitat selection, and apparent survival), we provide a rare example of linkage between behavioral responses of animals indicative of perceived predation risk and actual fitness outcomes. Moreover, our results suggest that exotic grass invasions can influence wildlife populations by altering risk landscapes and survival.","[Ceradini, Joseph P.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Chalfoun, Anna D.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, US Geol Survey, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",,"Ceradini, JP (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",JoeCeradini@gmail.com,,,State Wildlife Grant through Wyoming Game and Fish Department; Wyoming Governor's Big Game License Coalition,State Wildlife Grant through the Wyoming Game and Fish Department; Wyoming Governor's Big Game License Coalition.,,89,19,19,3,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, there has been little attempt to predict the likelihood or magnitude of such biases. Behavioural ecology provides a rich source of theory to develop a general framework for doing so. For example, if animals perceive observers as predators, then the extensive body of research on responses of prey to their predators may be applied to this issue. Here we survey the literature on flight initiation distance (the distance from a predator or disturbance stimulus at which prey flee) for a variety of taxa to suggest which characteristics of the animal, the observer, and the environment may create negatively biased counts. We also consider factors that might cause prey to approach observers, creating positive bias, and discuss when and why motivation for both approach and avoidance might occur simultaneously and how animals may resolve such trade-offs. Finally, we discuss the potential for predicting the extent of the behaviourally mediated biases that may be expected in transect counts and consider ways of dealing with them.","[Dill, Lawrence M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Frid, Alejandro] Cent Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, 2790 Vargo Rd, Campbell River, BC V9W 4X1, Canada; [Frid, Alejandro] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Stn CSC, POB 1700, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",,"Dill, LM (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",ldill@sfu.ca,,,,,,126,1,1,4,10,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

However, the neural integration of spatial and risk information essential for guiding goal-directed behavior remains poorly understood. Thus, we investigated simultaneous activities of fear-responsive basal amygdala (BA) and place-responsive dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) neurons as rats left the safe nest to search for food in an exposed space and encountered a simulated 'predator.' In this realistic situation, BA cells increased their firing rates and dHPC place cells decreased their spatial stability near the threat. Importantly, only those dHPC cells synchronized with the predator-responsive BA cells remapped significantly as a function of escalating risk location. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of BA neurons was sufficient to cause spatial avoidance behavior and disrupt place fields. These results suggest a dynamic interaction of BA's fear signalling cells and dHPC's spatial coding cells as animals traverse safe-danger areas of their environment.","[Kong, Mi-Seon; Kim, Eun Joo; Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA USA; [Kong, Mi-Seon; Zweifel, Larry S.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Park, Sanggeon; Cho, Jeiwon] Ewha Womans Univ, Scranton Coll, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Sanggeon; Huh, Yeowool] Catholic Kwandong Univ, Int St Marys Hosp, Inst Biomed Convergence, Incheon, South Korea; [Zweifel, Larry S.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA USA; [Huh, Yeowool] Catholic Kwandong Univ, Coll Med, Dept Med Sci, Kangnung, South Korea",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA USA.; Cho, J (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Scranton Coll, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",jelectro21@ewha.ac.kr; jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,"Kim, Jeansok/0000-0001-7964-106X; Cho, Jeiwon/0000-0001-6903-3562","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH088073]; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015M3C7A1028392, NRF-2019R1A2C2088377, NRF-2018M3C7A1024736, NRF-2020R1A6A1A03043528]","National Institute of Mental Health MH088073 Jeansok John Kim; National Research Foundation of Korea NRF-2015M3C7A1028392 Jeiwon Cho; National Research Foundation of Korea NRF-2019R1A2C2088377 Jeiwon Cho; National Research Foundation of Korea NRF-2018M3C7A1024736 Yeowool Huh; National Research Foundation of Korea NRF-2020R1A6A1A03043528 Jeiwon Cho; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,46,0,0,4,4,eLIFE SCIENCES PUBL LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,SEP 17,2021,10,,,,,,,,e72040,10.7554/eLife.72040; 10.7554/eLife.72040.sa1; 10.7554/eLife.72040.sa2,,,23,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,WF4KZ,WOS:000706276600001,34533133,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-19,

Increased prevalence and spread of human schistosomiasis to non-endemic areas has been consistently linked with water resource management related to agricultural expansion. However, the role of agrochemical pollution in human schistosome transmission remains unexplored, despite strong evidence of agrochemicals increasing snail-borne diseases of wildlife and a projected 2-to 5-fold increase in global agrochemical use by 2050. Using a field mesocosm experiment, we show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fertilizer, a herbicide, and an insecticide, individually and as mixtures, increase densities of schistosome-infected snails by increasing the algae snails eat and decreasing densities of snail predators. Epidemiological models indicate that these agrochemical effects can increase transmission of schistosomes. Identifying agricultural practices or agrochemicals that minimize disease risk will be critical to meeting growing food demands while improving human wellbeing.","[Halstead, Neal T.; Loerns, Kristin A.; Nguyen, Karena; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Hoover, Christopher M.; Remais, Justin V.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Div Environm Hlth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Arakala, Arathi; Gambhir, Manoj] Monash Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Arakala, Arathi] RMIT Univ, Dept Math Sci, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Civitello, David J.] Emory Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [De Leo, Giulio A.; Sokolow, Susanne H.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [De Leo, Giulio A.; Sokolow, Susanne H.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gambhir, Manoj] Global Serv Australia Pvt Ltd, IBM Res Australia, 60 City Rd, Southbank 3006, Australia; [Johnson, Steve A.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jouanard, Nicolas; Ndione, Raphael A.; Riveau, Gilles] Ctr Rech Biomed Espoir Sante, BP 226, St Louis, Senegal; [McMahon, Taegan A.] Univ Tampa, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33606 USA; [Raffel, Thomas R.] Oakland Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Rochester, MI 48309 USA; [Riveau, Gilles] CIIL Inst Pasteur Lille, 1 Rue Prof Calmette, F-59019 Lille, France; [Halstead, Neal T.] Wildlands Conservat Inc, 15310 Amberly Dr,Suite 250, Tampa, FL 33647 USA",,"Halstead, NT (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.; Halstead, NT (corresponding author), Wildlands Conservat Inc, 15310 Amberly Dr,Suite 250, Tampa, FL 33647 USA.",neal.halstead@gmail.com,"Johnson, Steve/AAF-2038-2020; Nguyen, Karena/AAA-7926-2021; Remais, Justin/V-3207-2019; De Leo, Giulio/AAC-5098-2019; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Nguyen, Karena/0000-0002-1916-1002; Remais, Justin/0000-0002-0223-4615; De Leo, Giulio/0000-0002-4186-3369; Sokolow, Susanne/0000-0002-5111-9322; Gambhir, Manoj/0000-0002-4831-6261; Hoover, Christopher/0000-0003-1976-8493","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1241889, EAR-1646708, EAR-1360330]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01TW010286, K01AI091864, R01GM109499, R01TW010286-01]; US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2006-01370, 2009-35102-0543]; US Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [CAREER 83518801]; University of Florida Research Innovation Award; Oakland University Research Excellence Fund award; Dana and Delo Faculty Development Grants from the University of Tampa; National Science Foundation (CNH grant) [1414102]; Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Stanford GDP SEED [1183573-100-GDPAO]; SNAP-NCEAS working group Ecological levers for health: Advancing a priority agenda for Disease Ecology and Planetary Health in the 21st century; NIMBioS-working group on the Optimal Control of Environmentally Transmitted Disease; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW010286] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic ScieNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1414102] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank G.

Although species level predator recognition is well documented, there is emerging evidence that some birds, including corvids, can differentiate between individual humans that pose different levels of threat. Other predator cues such as gaze direction may offer additional important information regarding the likelihood of an attack, but it is unknown whether wild animals can integrate information about the individual identity and gaze direction of a predator when perceiving threat levels. Here we measured wild jackdaws' responses to human head orientation, directed towards or away from their nestbox containing chicks. To test whether aversive responses to gaze direction were integrated with information about human identity, the human presenting gaze cues wore one of two masks: a 'threatening' mask that had previously been worn when handling the jackdaws' chicks and a 'neutral mask' that had previously been worn when walking by, but not disturbing the nest. Latency to return to the nestbox was significantly higher when the threatening mask rather than the neutral mask was worn, but it was not influenced by head direction. However, once a jackdaw landed outside the nestbox, there was a nonsignificant trend for it to be quicker to enter the box when the human was gazing towards, rather than away from the box. These results indicate that wild jackdaws can recognize different individual humans and thus differentiate between those wearing a threatening and a neutral mask, and respond defensively by guarding their chicks from potential threat. Jackdaws may integrate both predator identity and gaze cues; however, predation risk is primarily perceived through individual human recognition.

Birds can modify their reproductive behaviors in response to predation cues. Similar to predation risk, human disturbance may cause birds to exhibit parental antipredator behavior. Effects of human disturbance on nest site selection of Black Redstarts (Phoenicurus ochruros) were investigated from 2006 to 2009. Black redstarts altered their manner of concealing nests following human disturbance. The Black Redstarts were found to shift their nests to deeper locations in the cavities in the subsequent breeding season after human disturbance. In an undisturbed study plot, nests were not well hidden in the first year but shifted to deeper positions in the nest cavities following disturbance from researchers. The depth in the nest cavity at which banded individual Black Redstarts nested was deeper than its previous nest location depth after human disturbance. The results obtained in this study suggest that the Black Redstarts cognize human disturbance as a predation risk and exhibit adaptive behavioral plasticity in nest site selection associated with concealment.","[Chen, Jia-Ni; Liu, Nai-Fa; Yan, Chuan; An, Bei] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Lanzhou 73000, Peoples R China",,"Liu, NF (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Lanzhou 73000, Peoples R China.",naifaliu@sohu.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30530130],We are grateful to Hong-Yan Mu and Kai-Ji Fan for their help with data collection.

This paper (1) reviews studies in which human-scent contamination was suspected to have biased the survival of real and artificial nests by influencing the behaviour of predatory mammals, (2) summarizes the procedures used in attempts to mitigate human-scent contamination in nest-survival studies, and (3) describes procedures to enhance the design and interpretation of nest-survival experiments. The behaviour of various non-domesticated mammals is confirmed or suspected to be affected by human scent, so similar effects on nest predators are plausible. However, suggestions that human scent affects nest survival by influencing the behaviour of predatory mammals are poorly supported, due to a dearth of appropriately designed experiments. Some studies failed to include measures to reduce human-scent contamination, and the effectiveness of scent-mitigation methods used in other studies has seldom been verified. In addition, volatile compounds arising from soil and vegetation disturbed underfoot by field researchers may have confounded many nest-survival studies. Investigators have routinely inferred human-scent effects from post hoc predation patterns or have simply acknowledged possible human-scent effects among other potential influences of nest fate. Studies are needed of the effects of human scent using uniform methods of scent application and verified methods of scent mitigation, where the fates of different types of nests are examined under a range of field conditions. More fundamentally, studies of naive and experienced mammals are needed to assess their responses to human scent and clarify its salience in wildlife disturbance.","[Weldon, Paul J.] Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, 1500 Remount Rd, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA",,"Weldon, PJ (corresponding author), Natl Zool Pk, Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, 1500 Remount Rd, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA.",weldonp@si.edu,,,,,,100,0,0,6,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,JAN,2022,164,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1111/ibi.12966,,MAY 2021,12,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,XM9FX,WOS:000653281100001,,,,,2022-04-19,

For the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos), the hunting season coincides with the period of hyperphagia. Hunting mortality risk is not uniformly distributed throughout the day, but peaks in the early morning hours. As bears must increase mass for winter survival, they should be sensitive to temporal allocation of antipredator responses to periods of highest risk. We expected bears to reduce foraging activity at the expense of food intake in the morning hours when risk was high, but not in the afternoon, when risk was low. We used fine-scale GPS-derived activity patterns during the 2 weeks before and after the onset of the annual bear hunting season. At locations of probable foraging, we assessed abundance and sugar content, of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), the most important autumn food resource for bears in this area. Bears decreased their foraging activity in the morning hours of the hunting season. Likewise, they foraged less efficiently and on poorer quality berries in the morning. Neither of our foraging measures were affected by hunting in the afternoon foraging bout, indicating that bears did not allocate antipredator behavior to times of comparably lower risk. Bears effectively responded to variation in risk on the scale of hours. This entailed a measurable foraging cost. The additive effect of reduced foraging activity, reduced forage intake, and lower quality food may result in poorer body condition upon den entry and may ultimately reduce reproductive success.","[Hertel, Anne G.; Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Steyaert, Sam M.

Mecp2 functions as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes. Identification of the role of Mecp2 in specific neurodevelopmental symptoms remains an important research aim. We previously demonstrated that male mice possessing a truncation mutation in Mecp2 are hyper-social. We predicted that reduced fear or anxiety might underlie this enhanced affiliation. In order to probe risk assessment and anxiety-like behavior, we compared Mecp2 truncation mutants to their wild-type littermates in the elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze. Additionally, subjects were administered the mouse defense test battery to evaluate unconditioned fear- and panic-like behavior to a graded set of threat scenarios and a predator stimulus. Mutant mice showed no significant changes in anxiety-like behavior. Yet, they displayed hyper-reactive escape and defensive behaviors to an animate predatory threat stimulus. Notably, mutant mice engaged in exaggerated active defense responding to threat stimuli at nearly all phases of the fear battery. These results reveal abnormalities in emotion regulation in Mecp2 mutants particularly in response to ecologically relevant threats. This hyper-responsivity suggests that transcriptional targets of Mecp2 are critical to emotion regulation. Moreover, we suggest that detailed analysis of defensive behavior and aggression with ethologically relevant tasks provides an avenue to interrogate gene-behavior mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and other psychiatric conditions.

Based on the predation relations of 43 species that were representatives of the main trophic levels (TLs), a simplified food web was constructed using stomach content analysis and stable nitrogen isotope ratio (delta N-15) analysis. Using copepods as the baseline species (TL = 2.00), the TLs of the organisms ranged from 1.96 (Polychaeta) to 447 (Japanese flounder) and showed the following ranking order: predatory pelagic or demersal fish > medium demersal fish > crustacean, cephalopod, small pelagic or demersal fish > zooplankton and Polychaeta The metals showed different trophic transfer behaviors in the food web. Hg and Cr tended to be efficiently biomagnified between TLs, along the main food chains and in the food web. Cu biodiluted significantly with increasing TLs, while Cd showed no biomagnification or biodilution trends in the food web. At low or moderate levels of Cd and Hg, potential ecological risks were detected in the water and sediments at only a few sites, indicating their overall low ecological risks in the environment. The metals in the important fishery species (four top predatory fish, two cephalopods and eight crustaceans) were below the permissible limits, except for Cd in octopus and paddle crab, which reached or exceeded the most restrictive criteria. Based on the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) criteria, the safe weekly human consumption levels by humans of the predatory fish, cephalopods and crustaceans were species-specific (0.20-4.44 kg) and should be cautiously assessed.

This small and prolific species may be an excellent tool with which the biological mechanisms of vertebrate brain function and behavior are investigated Zebrafish has been proposed as a model organism in the analysis of fear responses and human anxiety disorders. Species-specific cues signaling the presence of predators have been successfully utilized in such research. Zebrafish has been shown to respond to its natural alarm substance with species-typical fear reactions. However, the extraction of this alarm substance and ascertaining its consistent dosing has been problematic. A synthetic substance with a known chemical identity and molecular weight would allow precise dosing and experimental control. Previously, the chemical component, hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide, common to several fish alarm substances has been identified and has been shown to elicit alarm reactions in fish species belonging to the Osteriophysan superorder. In the current study we investigate the effect of hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide by exposing zebrafish to three different concentrations of this synthetic substance. Our results show that the substance efficaciously induces species-typical fear reactions increasing the number of erratic movement episodes and jumps in zebrafish We discuss the translational relevance of our findings and conclude that hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide will have utility to elicit fear responses in the laboratory in a precisely controlled manner in zebrafish.

Habituation to nonlethal human disturbance in wild animals depends on their risk perception and is therefore hard to separate from effects of predation and hunting pressure. Having evolved under strong isolation with negligible predation and only recent (and local) hunting, the high-Arctic wild Svalbard reindeer represent an adequate model system for studies of habituation to humans. Here, we test for habituation by repeatedly provoking 739 flight responses in 29 radio-collared females throughout two summers in a nonhunted population where human activity level decreases with the distance to a small settlement (Ny-lesund). Following provocation by an approaching human on foot, reindeer escape distance (ED) before resuming normal activity ranged from 5 to 500 m and was highly variable among individuals (individual median ED = 23-100 m). Controlling for the effects of individual, observer, terrain ruggedness (positive effect) and having a calf (positive effect), ED increased with distance to Ny-lesund [from 32 to 57 m (w/o calf) and 38 to 70 m (with calf) across similar to 1 to 24 km distance to Ny-lesund]. ED also decreased with approach number during the two-month-long summer [average 44-34 m (w/o calf) and 55-43 m (with calf)]. The present study has demonstrated that the na < ve Svalbard reindeer habituates to human presence at small spatiotemporal scales through individual learning, suggesting that wild predator-free ungulates may adapt rapidly to increased human activity.","[Hansen, Brage Bremset; Aanes, Ronny] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, CBD, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Aanes, Ronny] NPI, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway",,"Hansen, BB (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, CBD, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",brage.b.hansen@ntnu.no; ronny.aanes@miljodir.no,"Hansen, Brage Bremset/B-9942-2008","Hansen, Brage Bremset/0000-0001-8763-4361",Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [216051]; Norwegian Polar Institute; Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics - Norwegian University of Science and Technology,"The study was funded by the Norwegian Research Council (Arctic Field Grant and POLARPROG Grant Nr 216051 to BBH), the Norwegian Polar Institute and Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (co-funded through the Norwegian University of Science and Technology).

Roads have facilitated the economic and social development of human populations. Nevertheless their presence and human use cause environmental changes, such as clearing, which increase perception of predation risk. Among the responses to this are changes in animal behaviours. In the present study, we sought to assess whether roads in an Argentine reserve affect perception of predation risk by guanacos, Lama guanicoe, through behaviour changes. We analysed the effects of two types of roads (unpaved track and paved route) and their surrounding environment (e.g. vegetation structure) on group size variation and on three behaviours: vigilance, foraging and movement. We also used the group structure of guanacos, such as the number of calves, to explain these behaviours. Roads in the protected area had no impact on the size of guanaco groups. However, individuals in larger groups were less vigilant and foraged more closely to roads, indicating that closeness to roads is less risky for these animals. Although guanacos' time spent moving was not affected by roads, nearness to the unpaved track and high plant cover showed the highest proportions of animals moving in the area, and individuals moved more when in small groups and in areas with medium-height vegetation. The number of individuals displaying vigilance or foraging behaviours was not affected by any of the explanatory variables. Based on these findings, we conclude that guanacos perceive the roadside environment as safer, possibly because open areas adjacent to roads facilitate detection of predators. Knowing the effects of roads on wildlife in protected areas is necessary to find ways to reach a balance between the economic development of a region and conservation of its biodiversity.

Prior studies showed that the brain concentration of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) is modulated by stress, and that changes in cerebral KYNA levels impact cognition. However, the link between these phenomena has not been tested directly so far. Objectives To investigate a possible causal relationship between acute stress, KYNA, and fear discrimination. Methods Adult rats were exposed to one of three acute stressors-predator odor, restraint, or inescapable foot shocks (ISS)-and KYNA in the prefrontal cortex was measured using microdialysis. Corticosterone was analyzed in a subset of rats. Another cohort underwent a fear discrimination procedure immediately after experiencing stress. Different auditory conditioned stimuli (CSs) were either paired with foot shock (CS+) or were non-reinforced (CS-). One week later, fear was assessed by re-exposing rats to each CS. Finally, to test whether stress-induced changes in KYNA causally impacted fear discrimination, a group of rats that received ISS were pre-treated with the selective KYNA synthesis inhibitor PF-04859989. Results ISS caused the greatest increase in circulating corticosterone levels and raised extracellular KYNA levels by similar to 85%. The two other stressors affected KYNA much less (< 25% increase). Moreover, only rats that received ISS were unable to discriminate between CS+ and CS-. PF-04859989 abolished the stress-induced KYNA increase and also prevented the impairment in fear discrimination in animals that experienced ISS. Conclusions These findings demonstrate a causal connection between stress-induced KYNA increases and cognitive deficits. Pharmacological manipulation of KYNA synthesis therefore offers a novel approach to modulate cognitive processes in stress-related disorders.","[Klausing, Alex D.; Fukuwatari, Tsutomu; Schwarcz, Robert] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Maryland Psychiat Res Ctr, Dept Psychiat, 55 Wade Ave, Catonsville, MD 21228 USA; [Fukuwatari, Tsutomu] Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Human Cultures, Dept Nutr, 2500 Hassaka, Hikone, Shiga 5228533, Japan; [Bucci, David J.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",,"Schwarcz, R (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Maryland Psychiat Res Ctr, Dept Psychiat, 55 Wade Ave, Catonsville, MD 21228 USA.",rschwarcz@som.umaryland.edu,"Schwarcz, Robert/P-3134-2018","Klausing, Alex/0000-0001-6863-7786",NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH103222]; Dartmouth College Scholarly Innovation Award,"This work was supported by NIMH grant MH103222 (R.

This study investigated the effects of unilateral phthalic acid (PA) lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) on fear-motivated behavior in response to a natural predator-stimulus. Such lesions preferentially disrupt the cholinergic projection to the BLA. Rats were placed in a chamber containing either real or fake cat hair, and the amount of time spent freezing and the number of contacts made with the stimulus were measured. Compared with Sham control rats, the PA NBM-lesioned rats displayed significantly less freezing in the presence of the cat hair. Both the Sham and lesioned rats made fewer contacts with the real than the fake cat hair. Pretesting intra-BLA infusion of the direct muscarinic cholinergic agonist oxotremorine ipsilateral to the PA NBM-lesion attenuated the freezing deficit. The indirect non-specific cholinergic agonist physostigmine increased the time spent freezing in Sham rats, but did not attenuate the freezing deficit in the NBM-lesioned rats. Sham and NBM-lesioned rats given oxotremorine infusions made fewer contacts with either the real or the fake cat hair. The PA NBM-lesion did not affect open field activity, These findings indicate that muscarinic cholinergic activation in the BLA from the NBM influences fear-motivated freezing behavior.

An alternative view is that psychopathy involves an attention-related deficit that undermines the processing of peripheral information, including fear stimuli. Methods: We evaluated these alternative hypotheses by measuring fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in a group of 125 prisoners under experimental conditions that 1) focused attention directly on fear-relevant information or 2) established an alternative attentional focus. Psychopathy was assessed using Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Results: Psychopathic individuals displayed normal FPS under threat-focused conditions but manifested a significant deficit in FPS under alternative-focus conditions. Moreover, these findings were essentially unchanged when analyses employed the interpersonal/affective factor of the PCL-R instead of PCL-R total scores. Conclusions: The results provide unprecedented evidence that higher-order cognitive processes moderate the fear deficits of psychopathic individuals. These findings suggest that psychopaths' diminished reactivity to fear stimuli, and emotion-related cues more generally, reflect idiosyncrasies in attention that limit their processing of peripheral information. Although psychopathic individuals are commonly described as cold-blooded predators who are unmotivated to change, the attentional dysfunction identified in this study supports an alternative interpretation of their chronic disinhibition and insensitive interpersonal style.","[Newman, Joseph P.; Curtin, John J.; Bertsch, Jeremy D.; Baskin-Sommers, Arielle R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Curtin, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jjcurtin@wisc.edu,,"Baskin-Sommers, Arielle/0000-0001-6773-0508","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH278980, T32MH018931]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH078980, T32MH018931] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Funding was provided by Grants from The National Institute of Mental Health (MH278980 and T32MH018931).,,31,180,183,2,52,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Alternatively, disturbance induced by hikers creates a relatively predator-free space that may serve as a refuge. We measured the behavioral responses of female caribou to disturbance associated with the presence of hikers during summer in the Gaspesie National Park. We used those data to determine whether caribou responded negatively to human activity (i.e., the predation risk hypothesis) or whether human activity resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of perceived risk (i.e., the refuge hypothesis). Female caribou with a calf spent nearly half of their time feeding, regardless of the presence of a trail or the number of hikers. They also decreased their vigilance near trails when the number of hikers increased. Conversely, lone females fed less frequently and almost doubled the time invested in vigilance under the same circumstances. However, both groups of females moved away from trails during the day, especially in the presence of hikers. We demonstrated that risk avoidance was specific to the maternal state of the individual. Lactating females accommodated the presence of hikers to increase time spent foraging and nutritional intake, providing support for the refuge hypothesis. Alternatively, lone females with lower energetic requirements and no maternal investment in a vulnerable calf appeared less tolerant to risk, consistent with the predation risk hypothesis. Synthesis and applications: Hikers influenced the vigilance-feeding trade-off in caribou, underlining the importance of appropriate management of linear structures and human activities, especially across the critical habitat of endangered species. Even if some individuals seemed to benefit from human presence, this behavioral adaptation was not sufficient to reduce annual calf mortality associated with predation.","[Lesmerises, Frederic; St-Laurent, Martin-Hugues] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Ctr Northern Studies, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Johnson, Chris J.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada",,"St-Laurent, MH (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Ctr Northern Studies, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.; St-Laurent, MH (corresponding author), Ctr Forest Res, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.",martin-hugues_st-laurent@uqar.ca,,,"Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Nature et Technologies; Ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Parcs du Quebec; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; John R.

Alternatively, bright birds may be aposematic or unprofitable prey, which leads to decreased predation. During four autumns, I examined whether the black-and-white plumage of (stuffed) magpies Pica pica increases or reduces the risk of attack by migrating goshawks Accipiter gentilis. Attack risk was higher for normal magpies than for cryptic, brown magpies whether the mounts were placed near one another or far apart. However, the brown magpie may have been avoided because of its novelty. For magpies and cryptic jays Garrulus glandarius exposed together, the attack risk was similar. In 2 years, magpie and jay mounts were also exposed far apart. In 1994, with an invasion of migrating jays, attack risk was much higher for jays than for magpies. In 1995, with a normal density of jays, hawks attacked the magpies more often. The results demonstrate frequency-dependent prey selection by goshawks, which would influence any predation cost of bright plumage. The attacks on normally colored magpie mounts suggest that magpies are not aposematic. Trials with photographs and human observers indicated that normal magpies were somewhat easier to detect than jays. The plumage of the magpie possibly increases the risk of predation, but may be favoured by sexual or social selection.",,,"Gotmark, F (corresponding author), UNIV GOTHENBURG, DEPT ZOOL, MEDICINAREGATAN 18, S-41390 GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.",,,,,,,68,31,32,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Here, we report an apparent exception to this general pattern. Courting male fiddler crabs Uca beebei sometimes build pillars of mud at the openings to their burrows in which crabs mate. Females visit several males before they choose a mate by staying and breeding in their burrows, and they preferentially visit males with pillars. Previous studies suggested that this preference is based on a visual orientation behaviour that may reduce females' risk of predation while searching for a mate. We tested this idea by determining whether the female preference for males with pillars increases with perceived predation risk. We attracted avian predators to where crabs were courting and measured the rates that sexually receptive females visited courting males with and without mud pillars. Under elevated risk, females continued to search for mates and they showed a stronger relative preference for males with pillars. Thus, when predation risk is high, females may continue to express preferences that are under natural selection because they help females avoid predation, strengthening sexual selection for use of the preferred signal.","[Kim, Tae Won; Choe, Jae C.] Ewha Womans Univ, Div EcoSci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Kim, Tae Won] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 151747, South Korea; [Kim, Tae Won; Christy, John H.; Dennenmoser, Stefan] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Naos Lab, Panama City, Panama",,"Choe, JC (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Div EcoSci, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",jaechoe@ewha.ac.kr,,,"Korea Research FoundationKorea Research Foundation; Korean Government (MOEHRD)Ministry of Education & Human Resources Development (MOEHRD), Republic of KoreaKorean Government [KRF2005-213-D00043, KRF-2006-351-C00044]; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Ewha Womans University Research Grant",Support was provided by Korea Research Foundation Grants funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD) (KRF2005-213-D00043 and KRF-2006-351-C00044) and a Special Research Grant from Amore-Pacific Cooperation.

Abilities to discriminate and recognise individuals form the basis of these relationships, and they are crucial skills for domestic animals, since individual humans can differ in their behaviour towards them. At the same time, with experience, animals may develop a general memory of humans and generalise their behaviour towards strangers. This study aimed to determine the extent to which weaned piglets can discriminate familiar humans and generalise their past experience when faced with unfamiliar humans. Forty-eight groups of three piglets were submitted to two consecutive 5-day conditioning periods of the same or opposite valence (positive and/or negative) given by one (A) or two (A then B) handlers. The reactivity of piglets to a motionless human and to an approaching human was measured before and after conditioning periods with unfamiliar and familiar handlers. Thereafter, piglets which received treatments with the two handlers A and B were subjected to a choice test between both handlers. The reactivity to an approaching human appeared to better reflect the past experience with familiar handlers since piglets clearly recognised them and adapted their behaviour accordingly. In contrast, reaction of piglets to a motionless human reflected their natural propensity to seek interaction, even after a negative experience. Although piglets were able to extend their memory of humans to an unfamiliar human through generalisation, many factors seemed to interact in this process, especially the complexity of the previous experience (inconsistent vs consistent) and the context in which piglets met the unfamiliar human (motionless vs approaching). We conclude that discrimination and generalisation processes of reactivity to humans do not simply rely on past interactions, but also depend on the context according to the degree of similitude with their past experience.","[Brajon, Sophie; Devillers, Nicolas] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Dairy & Swine Res & Dev Ctr, Sherbrooke, PQ J1M 0C8, Canada; [Brajon, Sophie; Laforest, Jean-Paul] Univ Laval, Dept Anim Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Bergeron, Renee] Univ Guelph, Alfred, ON, Canada; [Tallet, Celine] INRA, PEGASE UMR1348, St Gilles, France; [Tallet, Celine] Agrocampus Ouest, PEGASE UMR1348, Rennes, France",,"Devillers, N (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, Dairy & Swine Res & Dev Ctr, 2000 Coll St, Sherbrooke, PQ J1M 0C8, Canada.",Nicolas.Devillers@agr.gc.ca,,"brajon, sophie/0000-0003-2951-9888; tallet, celine/0000-0002-1899-9233; Devillers, Nicolas/0000-0002-5866-9394",Agriculture and Agri-Food CanadaAgriculture & Agri Food Canada,"The work would not have been the same without the valuable assistance of Sabine Conte and Marjolaine St-Louis.

This occurs because migration is considered a costly behavioral strategy that presumably confers explicit benefits to migrants in the form of either decreased predation risk (predation risk avoidance hypothesis) or increased nutrition (forage maturation hypothesis). To test these hypotheses, we studied a partially migratory moose (Alces alces) population and contrasted explicit measures of predation risk (i.e., offspring survival) and nutrition (i.e., accumulation of endogenous energy reserves) between resident and migratory subpopulations. We relied on data collected from migratory and nonmigratory radio-marked moose (n = 67) that inhabited a novel study system located in coastal Alaska between 2004 and 2010. In this area, 30% of the population resides year-round on a coastal foreland area, while 48% migrate to either a small island archipelago or a subalpine ridge system (the remainder exhibited one of six different low-occurrence strategies). Overall, we determined that accumulation of body fat during the growing season did not differ between migratory or resident modalities. However, calf survival was 2.6-2.9 times higher for individuals that migrated (survival, islands = 0.49 +/- 0.16 [mean +/- SE], n = 35; ridge = 0.52 +/- 0.16, n = 33) than those that did not (survival, resident = 0.19 +/- 0.08, n = 57). Our results support the predation risk avoidance hypotheses, and suggest that migration is a behavioral strategy that principally operates to reduce the risk of calf predation and does not confer explicit nutritional benefits. We did not directly detect trade-offs between predation risk and nutrition for migratory individuals. Yet we identify an indirect life history mechanism that may mildly dampen the apparent fitness benefits of migration. The proximate factors accounting for differences in migration-specific neonate survival are likely linked to accessibility of refugial habitats for moose at local and landscape scales, landscape factors that affect hunting efficacy of large carnivores, and interactions with rural human communities. Conservation of ungulate populations can be aided by integrating knowledge about migratory behavior, life history strategies, and factors that alter ungulate vulnerability, particularly those induced by human activity.","[White, Kevin S.; Barten, Neil L.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Wildlife Conservat, Juneau, AK 99811 USA; [Crouse, Stacy; Crouse, John] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Moose Res Ctr, Div Wildlife Conservat, Soldotna, AK 99669 USA",,"White, KS (corresponding author), Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Wildlife Conservat, POB 110024, Juneau, AK 99811 USA.",kevin.white@alaska.gov,,,Alaska Department of Fish and Game through the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program,"We thank G.

Prey is, therefore, forced to balance predation risk with resource reward. A growing list of anthropogenic stressors such as rising temperatures and ocean acidification has been shown to influence prey risk behaviors and subsequently alter important ecosystem processes. Yet, limited attention has been paid to the effects of chronic pharmaceutical exposure on risk behavior or as an ecological stressor, despite widespread detection and persistence of these contaminants in aquatic environments. In the laboratory, we simulated estuarine conditions of the shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, and investigated whether chronic exposure (60 days) to field-detected concentrations (0, 3, and 30 ng/L) of the antidepressant fluoxetine affected diurnal and nocturnal risk behaviors in the presence of a predator, Cancer productus. We found that exposure to fluoxetine influenced both diurnal and nocturnal prey risk behaviors by increasing foraging and locomotor activity in the presence of predators, particularly during the day when these crabs normally stay hidden. Crabs exposed to fluoxetine were also more aggressive, with a higher frequency of agonistic interactions and increased mortality due to conflicts with conspecifics. These results suggest that exposure to field-detected concentrations of fluoxetine may alter the trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk among crabs in estuaries. This fills an important data gap, highlighting how intra- and interspecific behaviors are altered by exposure to field concentrations of pharmaceuticals; such data more explicitly identify potential ecological impacts of emerging contaminants on aquatic ecosystems and can aid water quality management.","[Peters, Joseph R.; Granek, Elise F.; de Rivera, Catherine E.; Rollins, Matthew] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Peters, Joseph R.] Portland State Univ, Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97207 USA",,"Peters, JR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",jpeters@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,,Robert E.

We used a population of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in the Akasaka Imperial Grounds in central Tokyo, Japan to investigate how latrine-using carnivores can maintain their socio-spatial organization with human disturbance. Between 2012 and 2014, we selected 4-11 latrines per year (from a max. of 18 latrines recorded in the area) using 1 camera per latrine. We focused on latrines that included varying levels of human disturbance. We analyzed the temporal patterns of 3,257 latrine visits, of which 878 included defecation events. Overall, latrine use (i.e., visits with and without defecation events) increased as winter approached, coinciding with dispersal, and showed a seasonal shift from diurnal to nocturnal use patterns as days got shorter. Generalized linear mixed model results confirmed that temporal visiting and defecation patterns were affected by human disturbance and shifted from diurnal to nocturnal, although overall frequency of visits and defecation events did not decrease at disturbed latrines and raccoon dogs continued to use disturbed latrine sites. Raccoon dogs likely perceive human disturbance as predation risk and avoided this by shifting their temporal, but not spatial, activity pattern to minimize disturbance. Minimizing the amount of disturbance around raccoon-dog latrines at sensitive sites and times of day would allow them to co-exist with people with the minimal compromise to their latrine-centered socio-spatial organization.

Therefore, understanding the dynamics of reestablished predator-prey systems is crucial to predict their potential ecosystem effects. We decomposed the spatial structure of predation by recolonizing wolves (Canis lupus) on two sympatric ungulates, moose (Alces alces) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), in Scandinavia during a 10-year study. We monitored 18 wolves with GPS collars, distributed over 12 territories, and collected records from predation events. By using conditional logistic regression, we assessed the contributions of three main factors, the utilization patterns of each wolf territory, the spatial distribution of both prey species, and fine-scale landscape structure, in determining the spatial structure of moose and roe deer predation risk. The reestablished predator-prey system showed a remarkable spatial variation in kill occurrence at the intra-territorial level, with kill probabilities varying by several orders of magnitude inside the same territory. Variation in predation risk was evident also when a spatially homogeneous probability for a wolf to encounter a prey was simulated. Even inside the same territory, with the same landscape structure, and when exposed to predation by the same wolves, the two prey species experienced an opposite spatial distribution of predation risk. In particular, increased predation risk for moose was associated with open areas, especially clearcuts and young forest stands, whereas risk was lowered for roe deer in the same habitat types. Thus, fine-scale landscape structure can generate contrasting predation risk patterns in sympatric ungulates, so that they can experience large differences in the spatial distribution of risk and refuge areas when exposed to predation by a recolonizing predator. Territories with an earlier recolonization were not associated with a lower hunting success for wolves. Such constant efficiency in wolf predation during the recolonization process is in line with previous findings about the naive nature of Scandinavian moose to wolf predation. This, together with the human-dominated nature of the Scandinavian ecosystem, seems to limit the possibility for wolves to have large ecosystem effects and to establish a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade in Scandinavia.","[Gervasi, Vincenzo; Mattisson, Jenny; Linnell, John D.

This response could be genetically based and maintained as long as the population is exposed to predation. We tested whether predator scent in the form of hair would enhance perceived risk and serve as a foraging repellent to free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). During the winters of 2013 and 2014, we quantified alert behaviors and consumption of whole-kernel corn in response to current (coyote [Canis latrans]) and extirpated (bobcat [Lynx rufus]; black bear [Ursus americanus]) predator species alone and in combination with a partial visual barrier. Due to changes in herd dynamics and weather conditions, we did not compare results between years. We found enhanced alert behavior in all experiments except the 2014 exposure to coyote hair. Alert behaviors were heightened for about 4 days after hair placement. However, corn consumption was reduced only in the 2013 coyote-hair experiment. Our results suggest predator hair, when used alone and in conjunction with a form of visual barrier, can provide an element of protection from deer damage, but energetic needs will override the enhanced perceived risk caused by predator hair. Further work integrating complete visual barriers with predator hair is warranted.","[Seamans, Thomas W.; Blackwell, Bradley F.; Linnell, Kimberly E.] US Wildlife Serv, USDA, APHIS, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 6100 Columbus Ave, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA; [Linnell, Kimberly E.] Montana Fish Wildlife & Pk, 4600 Giant Springs Rd, Great Falls, MT 59405 USA",,"Seamans, TW (corresponding author), US Wildlife Serv, USDA, APHIS, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 6100 Columbus Ave, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA.",thomas.w.seamans@APHIS.USDA.gov,,,,,,48,3,3,1,26,JACK H BERRYMAN INST,LOGAN,"UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT WILDLAND RESOURCES, LOGAN, UTAH 84322-5230 USA",1934-4392,1936-8046,,HUM-WILDL INTERACT,Hum.-Wildl.

In the milder and more prevalent forms of the disease, behavioral abnormalities may include impaired social behavior, for example, difficulty interpreting social cues. Patients with FASD remain often undiagnosed due to lack of biomarkers, and treatment is unavailable because the mechanisms of the disease are not yet understood. Animal models have been proposed to facilitate addressing these problems. More recently, short exposure of the zebrafish embryo to low concentrations of alcohol was shown to lead to significant and lasting impairment of behavior in response to social stimuli. The impairment may be the result of abnormal social behavior or altered fear/anxiety. The goal of the current study was to investigate the latter. MethodsHere, we employed the alcohol exposure regimen used previously (exposure of 24th hour postfertilization embryos to 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.00% vol/vol alcohol for 2hours), allowed the fish to reach adulthood, and measured the behavioral responses of these adults to a novel tank (anxiety-related behaviors) as well as to an animated image of a sympatric predator of zebrafish (fear-related behaviors). ResultsWe found behavioral responses of embryonic alcohol-exposed adult fish to remain statistically indistinguishable from those of controls, suggesting unaltered anxiety and fear in the embryonic alcohol-treated fish. ConclusionsGiven that motor and perceptual function was previously shown to be also unaltered in the adults after embryonic alcohol exposure, our current results suggest that the impaired response of these fish to social stimuli may be the result of abnormal social behavior.","[Seguin, Diane; Gerlai, Robert] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Psychol, 3559 Mississauga Rd North, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Shams, Soaleha; Gerlai, Robert] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Cell & Syst Biol, Mississauga, ON, Canada",,"Gerlai, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Psychol, 3559 Mississauga Rd North, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",robert_gerlai@yahoo.com,"Shams, Soaleha/Q-8375-2018","Shams, Soaleha/0000-0003-4033-2539","NSERC (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [31163]; NIH/NIAAAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01 AA14357-01A2]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA014357, R01AA015325] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","NSERC (Canada) Discovery Grant 31163, NIH/NIAAA R01 AA14357-01A2.",,51,19,19,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0145-6008,1530-0277,,ALCOHOL CLIN EXP RES,Alcoholism (NY),DEC,2016,40,12,,,,,2667,2675,,10.1111/acer.13249,,,9,Substance Abuse,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Substance Abuse,EE0XY,WOS:000389304600022,27790739,Green Accepted,,,2022-04-19,

This is especially true for large carnivores as these species are not always tolerated by the public and can pose a risk to human safety. Unfortunately, information on wildlife species within the wildland-urban interface is sparse, and knowledge from wildland ecosystems does not always translate well to human-dominated systems. Across western North America, cougars (Puma concolor) are routinely utilizing wildland-urban habitats while human use of these areas for homes and recreation is increasing. From 2007 to 2015, we studied cougar resource selection, human-cougar interaction, and cougar conflict management within the wildland-urban landscape of the northern Front Range in Colorado, USA. Resource selection of cougars within this landscape was typical of cougars in more remote settings but cougar interactions with humans tended to occur in locations cougars typically selected against, especially those in proximity to human structures. Within higher housing density areas, 83% of cougar use occurred at night, suggesting cougars generally avoided human activity by partitioning time. Only 24% of monitored cougars were reported for some type of conflict behavior but 39% of cougars sampled during feeding site investigations of GPS collar data were found to consume domestic prey items. Aversive conditioning was difficult to implement and generally ineffective for altering cougar behaviors but was thought to potentially have long-term benefits of reinforcing fear of humans in cougars within human-dominated areas experiencing little cougar hunting pressure. Cougars are able to exploit wildland-urban landscapes effectively, and conflict is relatively uncommon compared with the proportion of cougar use. Individual characteristics and behaviors of cougars within these areas are highly varied; therefore, conflict management is unique to each situation and should target individual behaviors. The ability of individual cougars to learn to exploit these environments with minimal human-cougar interactions suggests that maintaining older age structures, especially females, and providing a matrix of habitats, including large connected open-space areas, would be beneficial to cougars and effectively reduce the potential for conflict.","[Alldredge, Mathew W.] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, 317 W Prospect Rd, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Buderman, Frances E.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Blecha, Kevin A.] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, Gunnison, CO USA",,"Alldredge, MW (corresponding author), Colorado Pk & Wildlife, 317 W Prospect Rd, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",mat.alldredge@state.co.us,"Buderman, Frances/AAT-2114-2020","Buderman, Frances/0000-0001-9778-9906",Colorado Division of Wildlife Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Project [W-153-R]; Colorado Division of Wildlife game cash funds,"This project was funded by Colorado Division of Wildlife Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Project W-153-R and Colorado Division of Wildlife game cash funds.

Flight initiation distance (FID) is the distance a human can approach an animal at a steady pace until it flushes. Recently, several studies showed differences in within-species FID according to human presence by comparing urban and rural habitats, with urban birds showing reduced FIDs. However, urban and rural habitats also differ in structure, which might affect FID. Therefore, in order to understand the real effect of human presence, we investigated whether differences in FID are also present in natural habitats (forests), differing only in the intensity of human use for recreation. We found that human frequentation had a distinct effect on bird escape responses, with shorter FIDs in forests more-heavily frequented by humans than in forests rarely visited by humans. Whether this finding is driven by non-random spatial distribution of personalities (shy vs. bold) or phenotypic plasticity (habituation to humans) cannot be assessed with our data.

When predator risk increases, the builder may change the location of a structure or remain on the structure but modify its behaviour. The main purpose of this study was to examine whether builders leave their current structure locations and relocate to a new location upon predator attacks. To assess this, we used orb-web spiders that regularly renew their webs and occasionally relocates their web site upon web-rebuilding. Specifically, adult females of Cyclosa argenteoalba were exposed to the air-borne vibrations from a tuning fork. These vibrations simulate the vibrations from insect predators' wings and trigger immediate anti-predator responses (jumping off the web to avoid attacks from predators and shaking webs). Spiders that received these simulated predator stimuli relocated more often on the day after treatment than did spiders that were not exposed to predator stimuli. This indicated that spiders estimated future predation risk from their predator-encounter experience and responded to perceived increase in predation risk at current site by abandoning their web site upon web-rebuilding. In addition, we examined whether the frequency of jumping behaviour and web relocation were correlated, but no significant relationship was detected.

Nevertheless, recent evidence indicates that in certain situations ungulate species may actually utilize areas associated with higher levels of human presence as a potential refuge from disturbance-sensitive predators. We now use four-years of behavioral activity budget data collected from pronghorn 9Antilocapra americana) and elk (Cervus elephus) in Grand Teton National Park, USA to test whether predictable patterns of human presence can provide a shelter from predatory risk. Daily behavioral scans were conducted along two parallel sections of road that differed in traffic volume - with the main Teton Park Road experiencing vehicle use that was approximately thirty-fold greater than the River Road. At the busier Teton Park Road, both species of ungulate engaged in higher levels of feeding 927% increase in the proportion of pronghorn feeding and 21% increase for elk), lower levels of alert behavior 918% decrease for pronghorn and 9% decrease for elk) and formed smaller groups. These responses are commonly associated with reduced predatory threat. Pronghorn also exhibited a 30% increase in the proportion of individuals moving at the River Road as would be expected under greater exposure to predation risk. Our findings concur with the 'predator shelter hypothesis', suggesting that ungulates in GTNP use human presence as a potential refuge from predation risk, adjusting their behavior accordingly. Human activity has the potential to alter predator-prey interactions and drive trophic-mediated effects that could ultimately impact ecosystem function and biodiversity.","[Shannon, Graeme; Cordes, Line S.; Crooks, Kevin R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hardy, Amanda R.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Angeloni, Lisa M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Shannon, G (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",graeme.shannon@colostate.edu,"Shannon, Graeme/A-5790-2011","Shannon, Graeme/0000-0002-5039-4904",Federal Highway Administration,"The National Park Service funded this study through a grant from the Federal Highway Administration, administered by the Cooperative Ecosystems Study Unit.

Coordinated vigilance, including unique sentinel behavior, is rare in nature, since it is time-consuming and limited in terms of benefits. No evidence showed animals adopt alternative vigilance strategies during antipredation scanning yet. Considering the nonindependent nature of both synchronization and coordination, we assessed whether group members could keep alert synchronously or in a coordinated fashion under different circumstance. We studied how human behavior and species-specific variables impacted individual and collective vigilance of globally threatened black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) and explored behavior-based wildlife management. We tested both predation risk (number of juveniles in group) and human disturbance (level and distance) effects on individual and collective antipredation vigilance of black-necked crane families. Adults spent significantly more time (proportion and duration) on scanning than juveniles, and parents with juveniles behaved more vigilant. Both adults and juveniles increased time allocation and duration on vigilance with observer proximity. Deviation between observed and expected collective vigilance varied with disturbance and predation risk from zero, but not significantly so, indicating that an independent vigilance strategy was adopted by black-necked crane couples. The birds showed synchronized vigilance in low disturbance areas, with fewer juveniles and far from observers; otherwise, they scanned in coordinated fashion. The collective vigilance, from synchronized to coordinated pattern, varied as a function of observer distance that helped us determine a safe distance of 403.75 m for the most vulnerable family groups with two juveniles. We argue that vigilance could constitute a prime indicator in behavior-based species conservation, and we suggesting a safe distance of at least 400 m should be considered in future tourist management.","[Kong, Dejun] Kunming Univ, Coll Agron & Life Sci, Key Lab Special Biol Resource Dev & Utilizat Univ, 2 Puxin Rd, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Kong, Dejun; Moller, Anders Pape; Zhang, Yanyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Ecol Systemat & Evolut, AgroParisTech, Orsay, France",,"Kong, DJ (corresponding author), Kunming Univ, Coll Agron & Life Sci, Key Lab Special Biol Resource Dev & Utilizat Univ, 2 Puxin Rd, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",kongdj05@hotmail.com,,"Kong, Dejun/0000-0001-9229-6440","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31201725, 31760624]; Talent Funds of Yunnan Province and Kunming University [YJL13002]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 31201725, 31760624) and Talent Funds of Yunnan Province and Kunming University (YJL13002).

Inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), the enzyme that deactivates the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG), exert anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models via 2-AG-dependent activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In the present study, we examined whether the MGL inhibitor JZL184 might modulate persistent predator-induced fear in rats, a model that captures features of human post-traumatic stress disorder. Exposure to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a volatile chemical that is innately aversive to some rodent species, produced in male rats a long-lasting anxiety-like state that was measured 7 days later in the elevated plus maze test. Systemic administration of JZL184 [4, 8 and 16 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (IP)] 4 h before testing caused dose-dependent inhibition of MGL activity and elevation of 2-AG content in brain tissue. Concomitantly, the inhibitor suppressed TMT-induced fear behaviors with a median effective dose (ED50) of 4 mg/kg. A similar behavioral response was observed with another MGL inhibitor, KML29 (4 and 16 mg/kg, IP). Surprisingly, the effect of JZL184 was prevented by co-administration of the CB2 inverse agonist AM630 (5 mg/kg, IP), but not the CB1 inverse agonist rimonabant (1 mg/kg, IP). Supporting mediation of the response by CB2 receptors, the CB2 agonist JWH133 (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, IP) also produced anxiolytic-like effects in TMT-stressed rats, which were suppressed by AM630. Notably, (i) JWH133 was behaviorally ineffective in animals that had no prior experience with TMT; and (ii) CB2 mRNA levels in rat prefrontal cortex were elevated 7 days after exposure to the aversive odorant. The results suggest that JZL184 attenuates the behavioral consequences of predator stress through a mechanism that requires 2-AG-mediated activation of CB2 receptors, whose transcription may be induced by the stress itself.","[Ivy, Devon; Palese, Francesca; Vozella, Valentina; Fotio, Yannick; Yalcin, Aylin; Ramirez, Gina; Piomelli, Daniele] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 3103 Gillespie Neurosci Res Facil, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Mears, David] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Anat Physiol & Genet, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Mears, David; Wynn, Gary] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Study Traumat Stress, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Piomelli, Daniele] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Piomelli, Daniele] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biol Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"Piomelli, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 3103 Gillespie Neurosci Res Facil, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Piomelli, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Piomelli, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Biol Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",piomelli@uci.edu,"Fotio, Yannick/AAE-4675-2022","Fotio, Yannick/0000-0001-5193-2009; Palese, Francesca/0000-0002-8426-8228; Ivy, Devon/0000-0003-0263-7235",Department of Defense through the Jackson Foundation [HU0001-15-2-0067],"This work was funded by the Department of Defense through the Jackson Foundation (grant number HU0001-15-2-0067).

Humans are often perceived as predators by prey and therefore respond fearfully to humans. Thus, fish responses to humans inside and outside of an MPA can provide insights into their perception of humans as a predatory threat. Previous studies have found differences in the distance that harvested species of fish initiate flight (flight initiation distance-FID) from humans inside and outside an MPA, but less is known about unharvested species. We focused on whether the lined bristletooth Ctenochaetus striatus, an unharvested surgeonfish, can discriminate between a snorkeler and a snorkeler with a spear gun inside and outside of a no-take MPA in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Additionally, we incorporated starting distance (the distance between the person and prey at the start of an experimental approach), a variable that has been found to be important in assessing prey escape decisions in terrestrial species, but that has not been extensively studied in aquatic systems. Lined bristletooth FID was significantly greater in the presence of a spear gun and varied depending on if the spear gun encounter was inside or outside of the MPA. These results imply a degree of sophistication of fish antipredator behavior, generate questions as to how a nontargeted species of fish could acquire fear of humans, and demonstrate that behavioral surveys can provide insights about antipredator behavior.","[Tran, Diem Samantha C.; Langel, Katharine A.; Thomas, Madison J.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,"Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244",UCLA Office of Instructional Development; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,"We thank the UCLA Office of Instructional Development, and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology for partial support.

Like ASIC1, ASIC2 subunits are expressed in the brain and multimerize with ASIC1 to influence acid-evoked currents and facilitate ASIC1 localization to dendritic spines. To better understand how ASIC2 contributes to brain function, we localized the protein and tested the behavioral consequences of ASIC2 gene disruption. For comparison, we also localized ASIC1 and studied ASIC1(-/-) mice. ASIC2 was prominently expressed in areas of high synaptic density, and with a few exceptions, ASIC1 and ASIC2 localization exhibited substantial overlap. Loss of ASIC1 or ASIC2 decreased freezing behavior in contextual and auditory cue fear conditioning assays, in response to predator odor and in response to CO2 inhalation. In addition, loss of ASIC1 or ASIC2 increased activity in a forced swim assay. These data suggest that ASIC2, like ASIC1, plays a key role in determining the defensive response to aversive stimuli. They also raise the question of whether gene variations in both ASIC1 and ASIC2 might affect fear and panic in humans.","[Price, M. P.; Gong, H.; Parsons, M. G.; Kundert, J. R.; Reznikov, L.

Arguments are passionate on both sides and debate has remained subjective and unresolved because experimental evidence of the ecological impacts of dog walking has been lacking. Here we show that dog walking in woodland leads to a 35% reduction in bird diversity and 41% reduction in abundance, both in areas where dog walking is common and where dogs are prohibited.

Open habitats with low cover facilitate predator detection, movement and escape, while closed habitats reduce the ability to detect predators and hinder movement. We performed a field experiment using nonlethal predators to study the reactive movement responses of medium-sized prey in patches with different vegetation characteristics related to elevated predation risk. Ten GPS-collared, free-ranging European hares, Lepus europaeus, were repeatedly subjected to a leashed dog and two humans in an experimental cross-over design. Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of the treatment and its interaction with vegetation parameters on the movement behaviour of the European hare. The reactive movement response was best explained by the model that included the interaction between elevated predation risk and vegetation structure. A strong immediate response was found in short vegetation up to 1 h after the treatment ended. The effect extended beyond the duration of the treatment and was synchronized with the resting and foraging period over the next 24 h. The distance covered between resting and foraging grounds was negatively affected, while use of less risky, low-quality vegetation during resting and foraging was favoured. Medium-sized prey species exhibit strong behavioural responses to the perceived predation risk, which we demonstrate here for the European hare. An elevated predation risk, for example by dogs, can trigger costly behavioural responses in these medium-sized prey species. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We designed a playback experiment to test the effect of noise on predation risk assessment. We found that in response to boat motor playback, Caribbean hermit crabs (Coenobita clypeatus) allowed a simulated predator to approach closer before they hid. Two hypotheses may explain how boat noise affected risk assessment: it masked an approaching predator's sound; and/or it reallocated some of the crabs' finite attention, effectively distracting them, and thus preventing them from responding to an approaching threat. We found no support for the first hypothesis: a silent looming object still got closer during boat motor playbacks than during silence. However, we found support for the attentional hypothesis: when we added flashing lights to the boat motor noise to further distract the hermit crabs, we were able to approach the crabs more closely than with the noise alone. Anthropogenic sounds may thus distract prey and make them more vulnerable to predation.","[Chan, Alvin Aaden Yim-Hol; Giraldo-Perez, Paulina; Smith, Sonja; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244; Giraldo-Perez, Paulina/0000-0001-8707-9919",Office of Instructional Development; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,"We thank the UCLA Office of Instructional Development, and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology for partial support, Rafe Boulon for facilitating our field research permits (no.

In many studies of antipredator behavior in prey animals, simulated threats, such as human activities (movements, approaching prey), have been used as experimental threat factors, often in controlled circumstances, while prey responses to other animals in natural environments have been less investigated. This paper discusses the responses of goitered gazelles in the wild during encounters with various animals in their natural habitat to evaluate their cues used to assess the magnitude of potential threats. This study found that the goitered gazelles' behavioral responses to perceived risk differed across the various species sharing their habitat, with kulan recognized as a minimal threat and Siberian ibex the most threatening among ungulates. Among predators, the fox caused the least fear, while a horseman with a dog was identified as the greatest threat, with a wolf falling in between. Goitered gazelles adjusted their responses depending on the traits of the species encountered, while the features and conditions in their local environment played a less significant role. During encounters with other species, the gazelles ranked them according to their potential risk level based on the animal's appearance and behavior. The gazelles did distinguish between predators and other species and reacted to them differently: from pursuing and harassing the smallest (fox), to a panicky, running escape from their most dangerous natural predator (wolf), and especially from their most lethal, non-natural predator (herdsmen-mainly local poachers). Thus, this study suggested that goitered gazelles differentiate between predator species, assess their traits and intentions in each particular setting, and respond in the most advantageous way to each threat challenge.","[Blank, D.

Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on human-carnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes. The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes-creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O'Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km(2) of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into human-carnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.","[Ramirez-alvarez, Diego; Salgado, Ivan] Serv Agr Ganadero SAG, Unidad Vida Silvestre, Rancagua 2820000, Chile; [Napolitano, Constanza] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Ciencias Biol & Biodiversidad, Osorno 5312435, Chile; [Napolitano, Constanza] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad IEB, Santiago 7800003, Chile",,"Ramirez-alvarez, D (corresponding author), Serv Agr Ganadero SAG, Unidad Vida Silvestre, Rancagua 2820000, Chile.; Napolitano, C (corresponding author), Univ Los Lagos, Dept Ciencias Biol & Biodiversidad, Osorno 5312435, Chile.; Napolitano, C (corresponding author), Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad IEB, Santiago 7800003, Chile.",diego.ramirez@sag.gob.cl; constanza.napolitano@ulagos.cl; ivan.salgado@sag.gob.cl,,"Ramirez-Alvarez, Diego/0000-0003-1775-3853; Napolitano, Constanza/0000-0002-7081-6975","Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG, Servicio Agricola y Ganadero) of the O'Higgins region of Chile; ANID [PAI 77190064]","This research was funded by Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG, Servicio Agricola y Ganadero) of the O'Higgins region of Chile (D.R.-A., I.S.) and ANID PAI 77190064 (C.N.).",,88,0,0,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,APR,2021,11,4,,,,,,,965,10.3390/ani11040965,,,17,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,RQ8ZL,WOS:000642701700001,33807134,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-19,

Despite this, experimental tests of the healthy herds hypothesis, wherein predators influence pathogen transmission, are rare. Moreover, no studies have separated effects mediated by density vs. traits. Using a semi-natural mesocosm experiment, we investigated the interactive effects of predatory dragonfly larvae (caged or lethal [free-ranging]) and a viral pathogen, ranavirus, on larval amphibians (grey treefrogs and northern leopard frogs). We determined the influence of predators on ranavirus transmission and the relative importance of density- and trait-mediated effects on observed patterns. Lethal predators reduced ranavirus infection prevalence by 57%-83% compared to no-predator and caged-predator treatments. The healthy herds effect was more strongly associated with reductions in tadpole density than behavioural responses to predators. We also assessed whether ranavirus altered the responses of tadpoles to predators. In the absence of virus, tadpoles reduced activity levels and developed deeper tails in the presence of predators. However, there was no evidence that virus presence or infection altered responses to predators. Finally, we compared the magnitude of trophic cascades initiated by individual and combined natural enemies. Lethal predators initiated a trophic cascade by reducing tadpole density, but caged predators and ranavirus did not. The absence of a virus-induced trophic cascade is ostensibly the consequence of limited virus-induced mortality and the ability of infected individuals to continue interacting within the community. Our results provide support for the healthy herds hypothesis in amphibian communities. We uniquely demonstrate that density-mediated effects of predators outweigh trait-mediated effects in driving this pattern. Moreover, this study was one of the first to directly compare trophic cascades caused by predators and pathogens. Our results underscore the importance of examining the interactions between predators and pathogens in ecology.","[Gallaghe, Samantha J.; Tornabene, Brian J.; DeBlieux, Turner S.; Pochini, Katherine M.; Chislock, Michael F.; Compton, Zachary A.; Eiler, Lexington K.; Verble, Kelton M.; Hoverman, Jason T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tornabene, Brian J.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Chislock, Michael F.] SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol, Brockport, NY 14420 USA; [Verble, Kelton M.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA",,"Hoverman, JT (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jhoverm@purdue.edu,"Hoverman, Jason T/D-1756-2013","Hoverman, Jason T/0000-0002-4002-2728; Tornabene, Brian/0000-0002-2348-3119",NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM109499] Funding Source: Medline,,,63,3,3,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We tested the hypothesis that fear-induced cascade effects are more pronounced in organic turbid water through an experiment in which we manipulated turbidity (clear water and organic/inorganic turbid water) and predation risk (presence/absence of a top predator) in a 3 x 2 factorial design. We assessed prey consumption, prey selection (benthic and planktonic invertebrates) and food partitioning among individuals within shoals of an invertivorous fish,Moenkhausia forestii. The overall prey consumption by mesopredators was similar with and without top predator in clear water, but the presence of a top predator resulted in decreased invertebrate consumption in turbid waters, with no difference between organic and inorganic turbidity. Also, fear-induced cascade effects caused a strong preference of planktonic prey over benthic in inorganic turbidity and decreased evenness in prey consumption among individuals. Our findings suggest that the interactive effects of turbidity and top predator presence on mesopredator foraging depend on prey type and highlight individual differences in foraging behaviours among shoal members. Increased anthropogenic impacts on aquatic environments could have lasting long-term population impacts for fishes in terms of foraging and predator avoidance behaviour.","[Figueiredo, Bruno R.

At the daily scale, diurnal or nocturnal activity can be a response to variations in food availability and/or human avoidance. At the seasonal scale, variation in prey vulnerability underlies the influence of predators on prey population dynamics, which is of management concern when predation affects domestic species. We analyzed the movement patterns of 133 GPS-collared brown bears in three study areas in Sweden in spring, when bears prey on the calves of domestic reindeer and moose, and in summer-early fall, when bears rely mostly on berries, in three areas with a gradient of human disturbance. In spring, the bears' daily movement patterns and time of predation on ungulates overlapped. In summer-early fall, when bears are hyperphagic to store fat for hibernation and reproduction, variation in the degree of nocturnal behavior among study areas likely reflected behavioral adjustments to reduce the risk of encountering people. Flexibility in daily movement patterns by large carnivores may help them survive in human-dominated landscapes, but behavioral changes may also reflect environmental degradation, for example human disturbance influencing foraging opportunities. Diurnal human activity disturbs the carnivores, but that does not hinder depredation on reindeer, because it occurs mostly at night. Thus, ideally carnivores and reindeer should be separated spatially to reduce depredations. A zoning system prioritizing carnivore conservation and reindeer herding in different areas might help reduce a long-lasting conflict.","[Ordiz, A.; Swenson, J.

Understanding this variation may allow us to understand how 'fear' structures communities, as well as to predict which species are likely to coexist with humans. I used flight initiation distance (FID) as a comparative metric of wariness and examined the relative importance of life history and natural history traits in explaining variation in FID in 150 species of birds. In a series of comparative analyses, I used independent contrasts to control for phylogenetic similarity and regressed continuous life history traits against flight initiation distance. Body size had a large and significant effect in explaining variation in flightiness: larger species initiated flight at greater distances than smaller species. After controlling for variation explained by body size, there was a nonsignificant positive relation between the age of first reproduction and FID. There were no relations between FID and clutch size, number of days spent feeding young, longevity, or habitat density. I used concentrated changes tests to look for evidence of coevolution between flightiness and dichotomous traits. Flightiness evolved multiple times and some clades were flightier than others. Flightiness was more likely to evolve in omnivorous/carnivorous species and in cooperatively breeding species. These results suggest that body size and age of first reproduction are important in explaining variation in disturbance tolerance in birds, and that species that capture live prey and those that are highly social are relatively wary. The results suggest a novel mechanism of how anthropogenic disturbance may contribute to extinction. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, because of their proximity to urban centers, the level of human visitation associated with state parks may be highly variable. Little information has been published regarding the effect of human visitation levels on wildlife escape behavior in state parks. We evaluated flight initiation distances (FIDs) and buffer distances (i.e., the difference between alert and flight distances) for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) from September 2013 to August 2014 at 3 state parks in east-central Illinois with different human visitation rates. Deer FIDs were lower in a high-visitation park and higher in a low-visitation park. The buffer distances were higher in a high-visitation park and lower in a low-visitation park.

Stimuli were positioned outside the home-cage and the ensuing reaction recorded. Baseline tympanic membrane temperature (TMT) was subtracted from the post-trial measure to determine changes in blood flow induced by ipsilateral brain activity. Cortisol was assayed immediately after the post-trial TMT assessments. Both genders reacted fearfully/anxiously towards the stimuli - each condition inducing a distinct pattern. Cortisol increased only when females were confronted with the wildcat, with higher levels of alarm calls predicting lower cortisol release. When either stimulus was present, changes in TMT were detected, albeit only in the right ear. The specific directional shift in temperature was gender- and stimulus-dependent, requiring further investigation. The control trial did not alter any of the parameters. Marmosets thus exhibit flexible multileveled coping strategies towards different aversive events, yet in general these seem to be asymmetrically processed by the right cerebral hemisphere.","[Pereira, Lucas C.; Duarte, Renata B.; Maior, Rafael S.; Barros, Marilia] Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Primate Ctr, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Maior, Rafael S.] Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Dept Physiol Sci, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Barros, Marilia] Univ Brasilia, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Pharm, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,"Barros, M (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Inst Biol, Primate Ctr, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mbarros@unb.br,"Barros, Marilia/G-1169-2012; Maior, Rafael S./F-3994-2012","Barros, Marilia/0000-0002-5010-8509; Maior, Rafael S./0000-0001-7219-8675","CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [409297/2016-0, 310719/2017-8, 304041/2015-7]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [304041/2015-7]","This study was supported by CNPq (409297/2016-0).

Human disturbance has been associated with declines in breeding success in numerous species and is of general concern to conservationists. However, the current framework for predicting and minimizing disturbance effects is weak and there is considerable uncertainty about why animals are disturbed by people in the first place. 2. We developed a behavioural model of perceived predation risk as a framework for understanding the effects of disturbance on cliff-nesting birds. This encompassed the concept that the effects of disturbance should increase with increasing numbers of visitors, and decrease with distance from the nest, an insight ignored in current conservation practice. 3. The predictions of this model were tested using field data on nesting success in two species of seabird, kittiwake Rissa tridactyla and guillemot Uria aalge. Statistical models of nesting success in both species suggested that perceived predation risk is a good predictor of the effects of disturbance. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that fixed set-back distances and buffer zones are likely to be inappropriate conservation measures in situations where the numbers of visitors to wildlife areas fluctuates spatially and temporally, as is generally the case. In managing access to wildlife areas there is a need to ensure that larger parties of visitors are kept further away from the nesting areas of vulnerable species or that set-back distances are determined for the largest party likely to visit the site.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",,"Beale, CM (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",0102627b@student.gla.ac.uk,"Monaghan, Pat/A-4271-2008; Monaghan, Pat/E-6810-2015","Beale, Colin Michael/0000-0002-2960-5666",,,,48,273,299,4,143,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

For many species, appropriate responses toward humans are likely to be critical to survival and reproductive success. Although numerous studies have investigated the impacts of human activity on biodiversity and species distributions, relatively few have examined the effects of humans on the behavioral responses of animals during human-wildlife encounters, and the cognitive processes underpinning those responses. Furthermore, while humans often present a significant threat to animals, the presence or behavior of people may be also associated with benefits, such as food rewards. In scenarios where humans vary in their behavior, wild animals would be expected to benefit from the ability to discriminate between dangerous, neutral and rewarding people. Additionally, individual differences in cognitive and behavioral phenotypes and past experiences with humans may affect animals' ability to exploit human-dominated environments and respond appropriately to human cues. In this review, we examine the cues that wild animals use to modulate their behavioral responses toward humans, such as human facial features and gaze direction. We discuss when wild animals are expected to attend to certain cues, how information is used, and the cognitive mechanisms involved. We consider how the cognitive abilities of wild animals are likely to be under selection by humans and therefore influence population and community composition. We conclude by highlighting the need for long-term studies on free-living, wild animals to fully understand the causes and ecological consequences of variation in responses to human cues. The effects of humans on wildlife behavior are likely to be substantial, and a detailed understanding of these effects is key to implementing effective conservation strategies and managing human-wildlife conflict.","[Goumas, Madeleine; Lee, Victoria E.; Boogert, Neeltje J.; Kelley, Laura A.; Thornton, Alex] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Lee, Victoria E.] Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, Anim & Vet Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",,"Goumas, M (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, Cornwall, England.",m.goumas@exeter.ac.uk,,"Lee, Victoria/0000-0003-3981-387X; Goumas, Madeleine/0000-0001-9338-2412","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002434/1]; BBSRC David Phillips FellowshipUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [B/H021817/2]; Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RG0049/2017]; Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London [DH140080, DH160082]; Royal Society Enhancement Award",VL was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (NE/L002434/1).

Through behavioural flexibility such species may trade off abundant resources with risks, both real and perceived. As highly adaptable mesocarnivores, caracals (Caracal caracal) provide an opportunity to examine development of successful foraging strategies in high-risk developed areas. Here we investigated caracal resource selection of both anthropogenic and environmental factors relative to availability at varying levels of urbanization in and around the city of Cape Town, South Africa, using GPS cluster-located feeding events (n = 326 prey remains, n = 384 scat). We also examined spatial and temporal risk mitigation strategies by assessing behaviours at feeding clusters. We find that, within home ranges, caracals living in the urban-dominated region (n = 14; 548 feeding events) select for the urban edge, while caracals in the wildland-dominated region (n = 3; 162 feeding events) avoid it. Adults selected more strongly for foraging at the urban edge than juveniles and may competitively exclude them from resources. By including back-traced scat feeding event locations, we were able to improve model resolution. We argue that caracals foraging on the edge of a large metropole mitigate risk of detection by remaining cryptic, prolonging handling time, and maintaining high feeding site fidelity where cover was available. Along with the strong functional response to the urban edge, this strategy suggests that carnivores are being drawn into, and stay longer in, areas with potentially increased prey availability despite higher risk. While behavioural plasticity clearly enables carnivore coexistence with humans in urban ecosystems, it can also be maladaptive if it reduces fitness and leads the population into an ecological trap. We provide mitigative recommendations to promote the conservation of this predator in a spatially isolated and rapidly urbanizing landscape.","[Leighton, Gabriella R.

As roads often have a negative effect on populations of birds and mammals, their effects are important for wildlife management. However, the effect of roads differ between different types of roads, and most studies of road ecology have focused on major roads with high traffic intensity, whilst effects of smaller unpaved forest roads in northern ecosystems are less known. We investigated the effects of forest roads in a mixed conifer forest in central Europe on cervid habitat use and browsing impact on forest regeneration during the winter season. We found that hunted cervid species avoided forest roads, and that browsing pressure was higher within the core of forest areas rather than close to roads. This led to an increased density of undamaged trees (by browsing) close to forest roads, whilst browsing damages were relatively high in the interior. Hunters often use these forest roads in the hunting season. We suggest that human disturbance creates corridors of fear along forest roads, and that cervids alter their habitat and browse use to avoid humans. This in turn has implications for forest and cervid management. This is the first study to document that gravel roads can affect oak trees through modifying cervid behavior. Future studies should use experiments to explore this question further and separate different effects of forest roads to understand the mechanisms; edge effects on vegetation, traffic, effects on natural predators and human disturbance.","[Mathisen, Karen Marie] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Postboks 400, N-2418 Elverum, Norway; [Wojcicki, Adam; Borowski, Zbigniew] Forest Res Inst, Dept Forest Ecol, Braci Lesnej Str 3, PL-05090 Sekocin Stary, Raszyn, Poland",,"Mathisen, KM (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, Dept Forestry & Wildlife Management, Postboks 400, N-2418 Elverum, Norway.",karen.mathisen@inn.no; WojcickA@ibles.waw.pl; Z.Borowski@ibles.waw.pl,"Borowski, Zbigniew/AAL-6483-2021; Borowski, Zbigniew/AAI-6571-2020; Borowski, Zbigniew/AAF-5230-2020; Mathisen, Karen Marie/T-8084-2019","Borowski, Zbigniew/0000-0003-4109-5205; Mathisen, Karen Marie/0000-0001-5166-8009",Forest Research Institute; State Forests National Holding of Poland,"The internship for this study was financed by the Forest Research Institute and the State Forests National Holding of Poland.

Prey responses to conspicuous indicators of risk (such as looming predators or fleeing conspecifics) are well documented, but there should also be strong selection for the detection of more subtle cues. A predator's head orientation and eye-gaze direction are good candidates for subtle but useful indicators of risk, since many predators orient their head and eyes towards their prey as they attack. We describe the first explicit demonstration of a bird responding to a live predator's eye-gaze direction. We present wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) with human 'predators' whose frontal appearance and gaze direction are manipulated independently, and show that starlings are sensitive to the predator's orientation, the presence of eyes and the direction of eye-gaze. Starlings respond in a functionally significant manner: when the predator's gaze was averted, starlings resumed feeding earlier, at a higher rate and consumed more food overall. By correctly assessing lower risk and returning to feeding activity earlier (as in this study), the animal gains a competitive advantage over conspecifics that do not respond to the subtle predator cue in this way.","[Carter, Julia; Lyons, Nicholas J.; Cole, Hannah L.; Goldsmith, Arthur R.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England",,"Carter, J (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",julia.carter@bristol.ac.uk,"Purser, Julia/C-2538-2013","Purser, Julia/0000-0003-0303-9966",,,,48,59,59,1,36,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In the case of the high Arctic, the disturbance of incubating birds may bring further complications due to egg cooling. In addition, it is assumed that birds in the high Arctic are not shy and do not respond to human presence fearfully. We tested how quickly the Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea) nesting in two colonies in Svalbard return to the nest after human disturbance. One colony was situated inside a town where the terns were regularly harassed by human presence. The second colony was on a glacial foreland where breeding terns have limited experience with humans. We found that terns without frequent experience with humans returned to the nest about 5 min after disturbance, while urban terns habituated to human presence returned within a few tens of seconds. The urban terns in this way likely solve the risk of spending too much time off the nest, which could lead under the conditions of the high Arctic to the stopping of embryogenesis. Terns from a remote colony do not show lower hatching success of their eggs than the urban ones, however, incubation and the whole population of terns could be threatened when there is more frequent disturbance by researchers or tourists.","[Syrova, Michaela; Hromadkova, Tereza; Vesely, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Branisovska 31a, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Syrova, Michaela; Hromadkova, Tereza; Pavel, Vaclav] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ctr Polar Ecol, Branigovske 31a, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",,"Syrova, M (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Branisovska 31a, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.; Syrova, M (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Ctr Polar Ecol, Branigovske 31a, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",syrova.michaela@seznam.cz; hromadkova.ter@gmail.com; vaclay.pavel@upol.cz; petr-vesely@seznam.cz,,"Syrova, Michaela/0000-0003-2755-3716; Vesely, Petr/0000-0001-9935-2150; Hromadkova, Tereza/0000-0002-6360-0754",,,,102,0,0,7,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4060,1432-2056,,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,MAY,2020,43,5,,,,,399,407,,10.1007/s00300-020-02641-2,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LK4GY,WOS:000530820100001,,,,,2022-04-19,

Previous studies have found that moose avoid areas near roads. In late winter, when moose face depleting food resources elsewhere, moose may be more prone to use areas near roads for foraging. However, this presumed trade-off between foraging and keeping away from roads has not previously been investigated. We sampled positions from global positioning system-collared moose in late winter from a high-density moose population in Southern Norway that is heavily influenced by human infrastructure. We combined data on moose positions with detailed field surveys of food abundance at sites that were, respectively, intensively used or sparsely used by moose. The probability that a site was intensively used increased with increasing abundance of high-quality browse and also with increasing distance to the nearest road. This indicates that moose trade-off foraging against keeping away from roads. We also found that spatio-temporal movements in relation to roads were influenced by variation in perceived human-derived risk; moose moved closer to smaller roads (low traffic volume) than to major roads (higher traffic volume) and closer to roads at night than at day. Males moved closer to roads than females. In conclusion, moose clearly exhibited behavioural adaptations to cope with roads and traffic in the study area. Because availability of high-quality forage substantially influenced habitat use, it may be an option to establish artificial feeding sites during winter to keep moose away from the roads.","[Eldegard, Katrine; Lyngved, Jo Trygve; Hjeljord, Olav] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway",,"Eldegard, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",katrine.eldegard@umb.no,,"Eldegard, Katrine/0000-0002-3276-8087",Norwegian Public Roads Administration,We thank V.

Recently, studies have highlighted that exposition to predation stress during aquatic development can have a profound impact on life-history traits (e.g. growth rate, fecundity and longevity) and consequently on the ability of adults to transmit human malaria parasites. In this study, we present a review aiming to contextualize the role of Anopheles larvae predators as an ecosystem factor interacting with the malaria pathogen through its vector, i.e. the female adult Anopheles. We first envisage the predator diversity that anopheline vectors are susceptible to encounter in their aquatic habitats. We then focus on mosquito-predator interactions with a special mention to anti-predator behaviors and prey adaptations developed to deal with the predation threat. Next, we address the direct and indirect effects of larval predation stress on mosquito populations and on individual life-history traits, which strongly suggest some carry-over effect of the impact of larval predation on vectorial capacity. The last part addresses the impact of human activities on larval predation. Concluding remarks highlight gaps in the knowledge of anopheline bio-ecology which may constitute avenues for researchers in the future.","[Roux, Olivier; Robert, Vincent] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, MIVEGEC Unit, Montpellier, France; [Roux, Olivier] IRSS, 01 BP 545, Bobo Dioulasso 01, Burkina Faso",,"Roux, O (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, MIVEGEC Unit, Montpellier, France.",olivier.roux@ird.fr,"; Roux, Olivier/I-5675-2016","ROBERT, Vincent/0000-0003-1738-1842; Roux, Olivier/0000-0001-5440-0219",,,,156,11,11,3,24,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,MAY 8,2019,12,,,,,,,,217,10.1186/s13071-019-3479-7,,,11,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,HX7HH,WOS:000467575100004,31068213,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-19,

Long-lasting changes in behavior have been induced in laboratory animals to model and investigate the development and neural substrate of human psychopathologies. Under natural conditions, however, changes in behavior after an aversive experience may be adaptive because behavioral modifications allow animals to adjust to a threat for extended periods of time. In the laboratory setting, properties of the aversive situation and the potential of the animal to respond to the threat may be altered and lead to extensive, prolonged changes, indicating a failure in behavioral regulation. Such long-term changes seem to be mediated by neuronal alterations in components of the fear pathway. To understand psychopathologies, determinants of exaggerated responsivity and the underlying molecular and neural processes have to be analyzed in a comparative way under conditions that produce normal and abnormal fear and anxiety.

When aggressive, physically dominant species are displaced by anthropogenic disturbance, physically weaker species exploit competitor and predator downtimes to forage in previously risky places. Birds feeding at outdoor restaurants and cafes in association with humans are exposed to fluctuating levels of perceived danger caused by frequently changing densities of human diners. Consequently, birds must make decisions about which dining tables to visit based on trade-offs between foraging gain and perceived danger from avian competitors and humans. We tested the hypothesis that interspecific differences in response to perceived danger, combined with varying densities of human diners, dynamically alter which bird species predominates at dining tables. We found that house sparrows (Passer domesticus) tolerated higher human diner-densities than larger-sized, more physically dominant Eurasian jackdaws (Coloeus monedula). Sparrows were usually the first birds to visit diner-occupied tables and spent more time there than jackdaws. However, at diner-abandoned tables, this pattern changed: During low diner-densities at surrounding tables, jackdaws were usually the predominant species in first visits and minutes spent visiting, while at high diner-densities sparrows usually predominated. Moreover, along a gradient of increasing human diner-density, sparrows gradually replaced jackdaws as the predominant species in first visits and time at abandoned tables. However, at diner-occupied tables, once a sparrow chose which table to visit, factors other than diner-density influenced its choice of where to forage there (table-top or ground). To our knowledge, our research is the first scientific study of table-visiting behavior by birds at outdoor restaurants and cafes, and the first to reveal interspecific differences in table-visiting behavior by birds there.","[Haemig, Paul D.; Blank, Henrick] Govt Jonkoping Prov, Nat Div, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Haemig, Paul D.] Linneaus Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Kalmar, Sweden; [Sjostedt de Luna, Sara] Umea Univ, Dept Math & Math Stat, Umea, Sweden",,"de Luna, SS (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Math & Math Stat, Umea, Sweden.",sara.sjostedt.de.luna@umu.se,,,,,,47,2,2,2,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JUL,2021,127,7,,,,,505,516,,10.1111/eth.13145,,MAY 2021,12,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,SO8LT,WOS:000645937300001,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022-04-19,

The lethal effect of apex predators on mesopredators is well documented, but they also could affect mesopredators in non-lethal ways. We investigated foraging decisions and perceived risk in the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), a small canid that is often killed by larger terrestrial carnivores and birds of prey. We used giving-updensity (GUD) experiments and observations of vigilance behavior to assess the influence of temporal, spatial, and anthropogenic factors on perceived risk in a population of bat-eared foxes at the Kuruman River Reserve, Northern Cape, South Africa. GUDs were higher during periods around the new moon and lower in the presence of researchers, suggesting that foxes are warier in darker conditions, but perceive an increase in relative safety in the presence of humans. Vigilance, however, did not vary with these same factors. Observational data revealed foraging success outside the experimental context did not differ with lunar period, implying that higher GUDs associated with new moons were not due to higher missed opportunity costs associated with foraging at patches. These results suggest that GUDs may be capable of detecting more subtle differences in perceived risk when compared to vigilance rates. We highlight the important considerations of using GUDs to examine perceived risk for a predatory species and emphasize that future studies using GUDs should quantify predators' risk-related decisions by documenting missed opportunity costs to determine the implications behind patch-use behavior.","[Welch, Rebecca J.; Periquet, Stephanie; Petelle, Matthew B.; le Roux, Aliza] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-9866 Qwaqwa, Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa",,"Welch, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-9866 Qwaqwa, Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa.",welchrebecca83@gmail.com,"le Roux, Aliza/Y-3541-2019; Périquet, Stéphanie/J-9979-2019; Petelle, Matthew/AAF-2698-2019","Périquet, Stéphanie/0000-0001-8901-3729; Petelle, Matthew/0000-0002-1027-1838; le Roux, Aliza/0000-0002-9869-2580",National Research Foundation (NRF) Thuthuka Grant [TTK1206041007]; NRF [90491]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [294494],"The Bat-eared Fox Research Project was funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) Thuthuka Grant (TTK1206041007) awarded to ALR and a NRF Grant No. 90491 awarded to F.Dalerum.

However, predator-induced risk effects probably act at different spatial scales, which have often been ignored in trophic cascade studies. We studied how a fine-scale risk factor (distance from tree logs) affects ungulate browsing intensity and how this is modified over a landscape-scale risk gradient (distance from human settlements to wolf core) in the Biaowiea forest, Poland. We found that landscape-and fine-scale risk factors strongly interacted in determining the strength and magnitude of carnivore-induced risk effects on lower trophic levels. In low-risk areas, tree logs reduced browsing intensity in small patches (approx. 4-6m from logs), whereas in high-risk areas browsing intensity was reduced up to at least 16m from tree logs. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects changed, with the strongest reduction in browsing intensity around tree logs in high-risk areas (up to 37%) and the smallest in low-risk areas (<20%). Overall, the results of this study indicate that perceived risk factors act at different spatial scales, where impediments (objects blocking view and escape routes) act as a risk factor at a fine scale and carnivore distribution shapes perceived risk at the landscape scale. Moreover, these risk factors strongly interact, thereby determining the functional role of large carnivores in affecting ecosystem processes. These interactive effects should be incorporated in predator-induced trophic cascade studies to understand patterns of tree regeneration in ecosystems where large carnivores and herbivores live together.","[van Ginkel, Hermine Annette Lisa; Schotanus, Jildou; Smit, Christian] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Conservat Ecol Grp, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [van Ginkel, Hermine Annette Lisa; Kuijper, Dries Pieter Jan] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Ulica Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland",,"van Ginkel, HAL (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Conservat Ecol Grp, POB 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands.; van Ginkel, HAL (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Ulica Stoczek 1, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.",h.a.l.van.ginkel@rug.nl,"van Ginkel, Annelies/F-9305-2015; smit, christian/B-9817-2008","smit, christian/0000-0002-4044-9473; van Ginkel, Annelies/0000-0003-1224-0995; Kuijper, Dries/0000-0002-0324-5893","Ubbo Emmius Fund of the University of Groningen; Academy Ecology Fund; National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2015/17/B/NZ8/02403]","We would like to thank Ryan Leroux for help with data collection and the managers of the Bialowieza National Park for access to the study site.

Pragmatic approaches, such as independent assessments for soil and 'above soil' organisms, are unrealistic. This communication presents a workable alternative, extending the role of the hazard identification. For each chemical, a set of selected ecological receptors and exposure routes is considered. Terrestrial vertebrates, soil-ground-foliar dwelling invertebrates, plants, and soil micro-organisms, are potential receptors subjected to direct and indirect exposures. Direct exposures cover those related to the emissions during the Life Cycle of the chemical. Indirect exposures focus on those occurring after the emission, related to the fate and behaviour of the molecule in the environment. Direct exposures are regulated by the production-use-disposal patterns. Indirect exposures are regulated by intrinsic (physicochemical, biological) properties. Hazard identification considers the toxicological profile and the exposure potential for each receptor, and selects the key receptors for the assessment. Risk analysis includes, for each receptor, all potential exposure routes and the corresponding timings. Food chain biomagnification is quantified on the basis of toxicokinetic data and a three vertebrate species model, suitable for top-predators and humans. A higher tier approach, considering the lack of homogeneity of the exposure and probabilistic assumptions, can also be conducted. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Predation is an important context where this interaction occurs. Sampling wild fish populations revealed that boldness is size dependent in habitats with low predation risk but not in high predation habitats. This is predicted to occur due to a trade-off between a prey's metabolic demand, as per the metabolic hypothesis (smaller fish have higher metabolic requirements and thus need to be bolder) and their risk of predation, as per the predation risk hypothesis (smaller fish are subject to higher predation risk and should thus be shyer). However, since selective predation on specific individuals, age effects or the extent of direct experience with predators were not controlled for in these studies, the role of body size in modulating boldness remains unclear. Here, we tested the relationship between body size, boldness and predation risk in a widespread North American prey fish, the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas. From hatching onwards, we manipulated perceived risk by exposing minnows to either conspecific alarm cues (indicative of predation risk) or distilled water in a split-clutch design. When fish were 4 months old, we measured body size and determined boldness using an emergence assay. Different levels of perceived predation risk did not directly affect body size or general boldness in fathead minnows. However, as predicted by the metabolic and predation risk hypotheses, high perceived predation risk cancelled out the negative correlation between boldness and body size present in controls through phenotypic plasticity. This effect was independent of selective predation, direct experience with predators and age. By adjusting personality through phenotypic plasticity, perceived predation risk alone may thus be sufficient for individuals to maximize their fitness in high-risk habitats.

This is thought to reflect an adaptive behavioral manipulation, because toxoplasma can reproduce only in cat intestines. While it will be adaptive for the parasite to cause an absolute behavioral change, fitness costs associated with the manipulation itself suggest that the change is optimized and not maximized. We investigate these conflicting suggestions in the present report. Furthermore, exposure to cat odor causes long-lasting acquisition of learnt fear in the rodents. If toxoplasma manipulates emotional valence of cat odor rather than just sensory response, infection should affect learning driven by the aversive properties of the odor. As a second aim of the present study, we investigate this assertion. We demonstrate that behavioral changes in rodents induced by toxoplasma infection do not represent absolute all-or-none effects. Rather, these effects follow a non-monotonous function dependent on strength of stimulus, roughly resembling an inverted-U curve. Furthermore, infection affects conditioning to cat odor in a manner dependent upon strength of unconditioned stimulus employed. Non-monotonous relationship between behavioral manipulation and strength of cat odor agrees with the suggestion that a dynamic balance exists between benefit obtained and costs incurred by the parasite during the manipulation. This report also demonstrates that toxoplasma affects emotional valence of the cat odor as indicated by altered learned fear induced by cat odor. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These vocalizations induce a variety of anti-predator behaviors in conspecific receivers ranging from moving away from predators (alarm calls) to rallying conspecifics to fend them off (mobbing calls). While much is known about the immediate response to alarm calls, less is known about how mobbing calls influence subsequent antipredator decisions. Mobbing calls stimulate harassment of a potential predator. Therefore we predicted that hearing a mobbing call would make animals less likely to immediately flee an approaching threat. To study the potential effect of mobbing vocalizations on risk assessment, we primed common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) with a series of different stimuli and studied the variation in their subsequent decisions to flee an approaching human by quantifying flight initiation distance (FID). We found that although mynas increased their rate of locomotion after hearing mobbing calls, their subsequent decision to flee was not influenced. We also found that an individual's propensity to move and look explained some variation in FID. This suggests that while mobbing calls do not influence subsequent decisions to flee, they do affect subsequent behavior.","[Condon, Tom; Hakim, Abbas; Moran, Antonio B.

We measured salmon consumption by brown bears in British Columbia under different risk scenarios (the presence and absence of large male bears and people). Declines occurred despite superabundant food where consumption was never limited by salmon abundance. While there were significant changes in the proportion of time spent foraging and in the consumption of captured fish between periods with and without ecotourists present, there was no change in foraging effectiveness, catch per unit effort. Selection of sub-optimal habitats to reduce predation risk incurs energy costs. Risk avoidance reduced daily salmon consumption by females with cubs by more than one third. By associating with people, females with cubs were able to avoid encounters with large, potentially aggressive males, which avoided people in both time and space. Controlled human activity at feeding sites can provide a temporal feeding refuge for vulnerable age/sex classes. This is the first study to quantify the energetic cost of intra-specific risk-avoidance for a large carnivore. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, other drivers, such as climate, landscape structure and the level of human activity, have a strong influence on deer pressure. The direct, density-related impacts of ungulates on forest regeneration have been well studied, but there is limited empirical evidence related to the indirect factors mentioned above. We conducted a field experiment in three forest divisions in Poland to evaluate the role of a common element of human infrastructure, i.e. small, unpaved forestry roads. Additionally, we assessed the modifying effect of visibility driven by vegetation cover and forage availability. RESULTS The proximity of unpaved roads affected deer habitat use and foraging behaviour, and limited browsing pressure on regenerating forests. Low visibility and higher winter forage availability increased the probability of tree browsing. We observed different responses to roads in two deer species: red deer avoided roads, while roe deer browsed in the vicinity of roads. CONCLUSIONS A typical forest network of unpaved roads creates a landscape of fear for red and roe deer, and limits browsing pressure on regenerating forests due to the changes in deer habitat use, activity patterns and foraging behaviour. Knowledge of the factors influencing browsing pressure can help to spatially optimise the application of protective measures for tree seedlings.","[Borowski, Zbigniew; Gil, Wojciech; Wojcicki, Adam; Pawlak, Bogdan] Forest Res Inst, Braci Lesnej 3, PL-05090 Raszyn, Poland; [Barton, Kamil] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Krakow, Poland",,"Borowski, Z (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst, Braci Lesnej 3, PL-05090 Raszyn, Poland.",z.borowski@ibles.waw.pl,"Borowski, Zbigniew/AAL-6483-2021","Borowski, Zbigniew/0000-0003-4109-5205; Barton, Kamil/0000-0001-5562-8274",State Forests National Forest Holding [500-430],"The study was financially supported by The State Forests National Forest Holding (grant no 500-430 to ZB).

Mothers exposed to TMT displayed more crouching and nursing behavior than those exposed to BTA, and TMT exposed pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations than BTA exposed pups. At PN30, rats were tested for freezing to TMT, water, or BTA. Rats exposed to TMT during the postnatal period displayed less freezing to TMT than rats exposed postnatally to water or BTA.

Whether such elevated risk-taking can spill over to uninfected group members is, however, unknown. To investigate this, we confronted groups of 6 three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, containing 0, 2, 4 or 6 experimentally infected individuals with a simulated bird attack and studied their risk-taking behaviour. As a parasite, we used the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus, which increases the risk-taking of infected sticklebacks, to facilitate transmission to its final host, most often piscivorous birds. Before the attack, infected and uninfected individuals did not differ in their risk-taking. However, after the attack, individuals in groups with only infected members showed lower escape responses and higher risk-taking than individuals from groups with only uninfected members. Importantly, uninfected individuals adjusted their risk-taking behaviour to the number of infected group members, taking more risk with an increasing number of infected group members. Infected individuals, however, did not adjust their risk-taking to the number of uninfected group members. Our results show that behavioural manipulation by parasites does not only affect the infected host, but also uninfected group members, shedding new light on the social dynamics involved in host-parasite interactions.","[Demandt, Nicolle; Saus, Benedikt; Kurtz, Joachim; Scharsack, Joern Peter] Univ Munster, Inst Evolut & Biodivers, Hufferstr 1, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Kurvers, Ralf H.

This comprises three paradigms designed to study the effects of cat exposure on general activity and location with respect to the cat (proxemic avoidance), the effects of cat exposure on non-defensive consummatory behavior, and the behavioral response to cat odor. In the present study subjects were exposed to 21 days pretreatment with imipramine (0, 5, and 15 mg/kg), before being assessed in the three experimental paradigms (carried out over a total period of 7 days). Imipramine treatment was maintained on a daily basis during the 7 days taken to complete the series of tests. The data indicated a behaviorally specific profile consistent with anxiety/fear reduction, but not with sedation, in three different paradigms, following treatment with 15 mg/kg imipramine. These behavioral changes included a reduction in freezing, proxemic avoidance and a disinhibition of suppressed feeding in response to cat presentation. Similarly, imipramine treatment (15 mg/kg) significantly reduced behaviors associated with risk assessment (e.g. flat back approach, stretch attend) during presentation of a cat odor stimulus. This behavioral profile suggests that chronic pretreatment with imipramine produces an attenuation of antipredator defensive behavior.","UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,BEKESY LAB NEUROBIOL,1993 EW RD,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & REPROD BIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,DEPT PSYCHOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV LEEDS,DEPT PSYCHOL,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND",,,,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH042803] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR01825, RR03061] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH42803] Funding Source: Medline",,,38,54,55,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JAN,1993,110,1-2,,,,,245,253,,10.1007/BF02246981,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,KG315,WOS:A1993KG31500039,7870893,,,,2022-04-19,

Flight initiation distance (FID) is often studied in the context of island tameness; however, little is known about the factors that influence and maintain FID variation in predation-free populations. Here, we studied FID in foals of an isolated predator-free population of feral horses (Equus caballus L., 1758) on Sable Island, Canada, to determine if FID could be used for research on consistent individual differences in risk aversion and island tameness. In addition to testing for temporal, spatial, and sex effects on FID, we compared repeatability estimates at two temporal scales (within and among days). Similar FID for measurements obtained on the same day and for males and females indicated an absence of short-term desensitization and sex effects. In contrast, FID decreased for measurements made on subsequent days and from east to west, which could reflect habituation to human presence and (or) other temporal and spatial processes. Repeatability was high (0.42 +/- 0.06), but tended to decrease with increasing time intervals. This study highlights the potential of FID for individual-based research on the ecology and evolutionary dynamics of risk aversion in predation-free populations.","[Cabrera, Doreen; Wilson, Alastair J.; Poissant, Jocelyn] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Cornwall Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, England; [Andres, Daniel; McLoughlin, Philip D.; Debeffe, Lucie; Medill, Sarah A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Poissant, Jocelyn] Univ Calgary, Dept Ecosyst & Publ Hlth, Fac Vet Med, 3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada",,"Poissant, J (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Cornwall Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, England.; McLoughlin, PD (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.; Poissant, J (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Ecosyst & Publ Hlth, Fac Vet Med, 3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.",philip.mcloughlin@usask.ca; jocelyn.poissant@ucalgary.ca,"Debeffe, Lucie/AAF-9976-2020","Debeffe, Lucie/0000-0003-0019-125X; Wilson, Alastair/0000-0002-5045-2051; Poissant, Jocelyn/0000-0003-1546-3609",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [371535-2009]; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR [25046]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of Exeter; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust,"We thank the numerous students, research assistants, and volunteers who have contributed to the Sable Island horse project over the years.

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that alterations to the acoustic environment can negatively affect birds as well as humans in a variety of ways, and altered acoustics from noise pollution has the potential to influence human interactions with wild birds. Birds respond to approaching humans in amanner analogous to approaching predators, but the context of the interaction can also greatly influence the distance at which a bird initiates flight or escape behavior (i.e., flight initiation distance or FID). Here, we hypothesized that reliance on different sensory modalities to balance foraging and threat detection can influence how birds respond to approaching threats in the presence of background noise. We surveyed 12 songbird species in California and Wyoming and categorized each species into one of three foraging guilds: ground foragers, canopy gleaners, and hawking flycatchers and predicted FIDs to decrease, remain the same and increase with noise exposure, respectively. Contrary to expectations, the canopy gleaning and flycatching guilds exhibited mixed responses, with some species exhibiting unchanged FIDs with noise while others exhibited increased FIDs with noise. However, FIDs of all ground foraging species and one canopy gleaner decreased with noise levels. Additionally, we found no evidence of phylogenetic structure among species' mean FID responses and only weak phylogenetic structure for the relationship between FIDs and noise levels. Although our results provide mixed support for foraging strategy as a predictor of bird response to noise, our finding that most of the species we surveyed have shorter FIDs with increases in noise levels suggest that human observers may be able to approach ground foraging species more closely under noisy conditions. From an ecological perspective, however, it remains unclear whether these mixed responses translate into lost foraging opportunity for hypervigilant birds that flee a threat too soon or greater predation risk due to impaired surveillance for those that only respond once approaching threats are near.","[Petrelli, Alissa R.; Wardle, Ryan; Francis, Clinton D.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Levenhagen, Mitchell J.; Barber, Jesse R.] Boise State Univ, Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA",,"Petrelli, AR; Francis, CD (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",arpetrel@calpoly.edu; cdfranci@calpoly.edu,,,"National Science Foundation GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNH-1414171]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic ScieNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1414171] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank Gita Kolluru, Crow White and two reviewers for constructive feedback on earlier versions of this paper.

Retaliatory persecution such as poisoning threatens predators, but also non-target biota. Several factors influence conflict severity, including livestock husbandry, overlap in seasonal habitat use, and the degree to which livestock perceive and are able to respond to a landscape of fear. We investigated these factors by GPS-tracking 42 Tswana beef cattle (Bos taunts) from 29 herds in 2017 and six lions (Panthera leo) from different prides (May 2016-Dec. 2017) in the northern Okavango Delta, Botswana, where cattle depredation significantly impacts the livelihoods of rural agro-pastoralists. Cattle exhibited seasonal habitat selection patterns similar to wild ungulates in the region. They preferred woodland habitats, with more digestible grasses, during the wet season. During the dry season, they preferred wetland habitats with reliable forage and water availability. Cattle also preferred areas close to human settlements, but the necessity to forage in wetlands during the dry season exposed them to significant depredation risk, especially > 4 km from settlements. Lions killed most cattle in wetlands during the late dry season but the intensity of recent lion presence (previous 14 days) only had a weak negative effect on cattle habitat selection patterns. Cattle used rangelands according to nutritional requirements, irrelevant of the associated predation risk, suggesting that socio-ecologically acceptable conflict solutions cannot rely on the exclusion of livestock from seasonal wetlands. Curbing depredation by lions will best be achieved by a combination of resource- and predation-cognisant seasonal herding strategies with adequate livestock protection. Understanding the ecological constraints that intensify conflict is pertinent to any livestock production landscape with predator presence. It is also a central prerequisite for future land use planning and devolution of legal, controlled resource access rights through policy. Coexistence strategies must account for the strong reliance of people, their livestock, and wildlife on shared key resources. This is particularly important In large trans-frontier conservation areas where the successful merging of biodiversity conservation and rural development is a strategic goal. Omission will foster resentment and resistance to coexistence with apex predators, particularly if livestock productivity and human livelihoods are negatively affected.","[Weise, Florian J.; Somers, Michael J.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Weise, Florian J.; Stein, Andrew B.; Tomeletso, Mathata; Periquet, Stephanie] CLAWS Conservancy, 32 Pine Tree Dr, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [Fynn, Richard W.

How these systems are affected is not clear as a direct experimental link between noise and behavior underlying these patterns is missing. Here we provide the first empirical evidence of the effects of long-term exposure to simulated traffic noise on social and risk-taking behavior of Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) and tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor). In testing for these effects we compare two hypotheses regarding the effects of noise on behavior. We found that noise increases sociality by reducing nearest neighbor distances and increasing the number of close-perches within study flocks. These behavioral responses mimic those of species in high-risk situations, such as birds in the presence of a predator. These results provide support for the 'Increased Threat Hypothesis,' which argues that chronic traffic noise affects behavior by increasing the perceived level of threat. Although the adaptive value or function of these responses to noise is unknown, they may serve to mitigate any negative effects of traffic noise. If true, species lacking behavioral plasticity may be more susceptible to effects of traffic noise and other similar acoustic disturbances. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Some mammals exhibit behavioral plasticity in activity patterns, which allows them to adapt to environmental changes. A good example of this can be found in the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This species is adapted to living in highly humanized environments, where it is often culled because it may affect human interests (e.g. through the consumption of game species or livestock). We assessed the potential main drivers of the daily activity patterns of the red fox in 12 Iberian Mediterranean areas through the use of camera traps. Among drivers, we considered main prey availability (European wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), degree of human disturbance (e.g. distance to human settlements, and intensity of predator control) and habitat structure. Our results revealed a predominantly crepuscular and nocturnal activity of foxes with local variations. Although overall fox activity increased with rabbit availability, the temporal overlap with prey activity was on average low, because foxes increased activity when rabbits decreased theirs (twilight-night). Red fox activity rhythms seemed to be determined by human presence where human disturbance is high. In addition, diurnal activity decreased in areas with higher levels of human disturbance (closer to human settlements and high predator control intensity) and increased in dense habitats. Our study shows that daily activity patterns of highly adaptable species are determined by several interacting drivers, resulting in complex behavioral patterns. This suggests that further ecological studies should consider different factors simultaneously for a better understanding of daily activity patterns of wildlife in different landscapes.","[Diaz-Ruiz, F.; Caro, J.; Delibes-Mateos, M.; Arroyo, B.; Ferreras, P.] IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Diaz-Ruiz, F.; Delibes-Mateos, M.] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO, Vairao, Portugal; [Delibes-Mateos, M.] Inst Estudios Soci Avanzados IESA CSIC, Cordoba, Spain",,"Diaz-Ruiz, F (corresponding author), IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",pacodi1480@hotmail.com,"Díaz-Ruiz, Francisco/A-7741-2015; Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009; Arroyo, Beatriz/A-3504-2013; Delibes-Mateos, Miguel/F-8733-2014","Díaz-Ruiz, Francisco/0000-0001-6024-7310; Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Arroyo, Beatriz/0000-0002-4657-6609; Delibes-Mateos, Miguel/0000-0002-3823-5935","Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2009-10741]; EU-FEDEREuropean Commission [CGL2009-10741]; HUNTing for Sustainability [212160]; Organismo Autonomo de Parques Nacionales, Spain [OAPN352/2011]; European Social Fund (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La ManchaJunta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha; Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion, Ciencia y Empleo of Junta de Andalucia; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [267226]","We thank landowners and hunters who allowed us to work in their hunting estates, and the staff of Cabaneros and Monfrague National Parks and Ruidera Natural Park.

Noise has been identified as a disturbance that has the potential to induce behavioral responses in animals similar to those associated with predation risk. This study investigated potential impacts of a variety of human activities and their associated noise on the behavior of elk (Cervus elaphus) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) along a transportation corridor in Grand Teton National Park. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted roadside scan surveys and focal observations of ungulate behavior while concurrently recording human activity and anthropogenic noise. Although we expected ungulates to be more responsive with greater human activity and noise, as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis, they were actually less responsive (less likely to perform vigilant, flight, traveling and defensive behaviors) with increasing levels of vehicle traffic, the human activity most closely associated with noise. Noise levels themselves had relatively little effect on ungulate behavior, although there was a weak negative relationship between noise and responsiveness in our scan samples. In contrast, ungulates did increase their responsiveness with other forms of anthropogenic disturbance; they reacted to the presence of pedestrians (in our scan samples) and to passing motorcycles (in our focal observations). Conclusions: These findings suggest that ungulates did not consistently associate noise and human activity with an increase in predation risk or that they could not afford to maintain responsiveness to the most frequent human stimuli. Although reduced responsiveness to certain disturbances may allow for greater investment in fitness-enhancing activities, it may also decrease detections of predators and other environmental cues and increase conflict with humans.","[Brown, Casey L.; Hardy, Amanda R.; Crooks, Kevin R.; Angeloni, Lisa M.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Barber, Jesse R.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Fristrup, Kurt M.] Natl Pk Serv, Nat Sounds & Night Skies Div, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Crooks, Kevin R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Angeloni, Lisa M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Brown, CL (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",caseylynnbrown@gmail.com,,,National Park Service; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0649876]; Colorado State University; Rocky Mountain Goats Foundation; United States National Park Service (RM-CESU Cooperative) [H1200040001],"We would like to thank Grand Teton National Park, including S.

As humans may be a threat, a neutral presence or a source of food, animals will benefit from continuously assessing the potential risk they pose in order to respond appropriately. Herring gulls, Larus argentatus, are increasingly breeding and foraging in urban areas, and thus have many opportunities to interact with humans. We recently found that herring gulls take longer to approach food when being watched by a human. However, it is not known whether aversion to human gaze arises from experience with humans, and whether individual differences in responsiveness are a result of differential exposure. Here, we tested whether herring gulls' responses to human gaze differ according to their age class and urbanization of their habitat. We measured the gulls' flight initiation distance when an experimenter approached with either a direct or an averted gaze. Neither gull age class nor urbanization significantly influenced the effect of human gaze on flight initiation distance. However, as recently fledged juveniles responded strongly to the experimenter's gaze, aversion to human gaze may not require extensive exposure to humans to develop. Gulls in urban areas could be approached more closely than those in rural areas, consistent with findings in other species. These results indicate that gaze aversion is present early in development and that exposure to humans may influence gulls' responses to perceived risk from humans. Investigating the processes generating individual differences in responses to humans will provide further insights into human-wildlife interactions and the effects of urbanization.

Here, we propose various ways in which knowledge of antipredator tactics, behavioral risk effects, and primate-predator interactions could assist in identifying human-caused disruption to natural systems. Using behavior to evaluate primate responses to the ongoing environmental change should be a potentially effective way to make species conservation more predictive by identifying issues before a more dramatic population declines. A key challenge here is that studies of predation on primates often use data collected via direct observations of habituated animals and human presence can deter carnivores and influence subjects' perception of risk. Hence, we also review various indirect data collection methods to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying where environmental change threatens wild species, while also minimizing observer bias.","[LaBarge, Laura R.; Berman, Carol M.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Environm & Sustainabil, Program Evolut Ecol & Behav, Amherst, NY USA; [LaBarge, Laura R.; Hill, Russell A.; Allan, Andrew T.

Many factors can contribute to this but, for moving groups, an increased difficulty in tracking and targeting one individual amongst many has received particular attention. This confusion effect has been proposed to result from a bottleneck in information processing, a hypothesis supported by both modelling and experiment. If the competition for limited attention is localised to the particular part of the visual field where the target is located, prey density is likely to be the key factor rather than group numbers per se. Furthermore, unpredictability of prey movement may enhance confusion, but both factors have received insufficient attention from empiricists: undoubtedly because of the difficulty of experimental manipulation in natural systems. We used a computer-based target tracking task with human subjects to manipulate effects of number and density independently, in factorial combination with motion path predictability. Density, rather than number, drove the confusion effect in our experiment and acted synergistically with the unpredictability of the direction of motion. The experimental paradigm we present offers the potential for isolating other factors affecting predation success on group-living prey, and forging links with the psychological literature on object tracking and visual search.","[Scott-Samuel, Nicholas E.; Baddeley, Roland] Univ Bristol, Sch Expt Psychol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Holmes, Gavin] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Cuthill, Innes C.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Scott-Samuel, NE (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Expt Psychol, Bristol, Avon, England.",n.e.scott-samuel@bris.ac.uk,,"Scott-Samuel, Nicholas/0000-0002-8270-8437",BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC),This research was supported by the BBSRC.

We found the highest and most variable FGM concentrations in both ungulates in areas without large carnivores, and the lowest and least variable FGM levels in areas with wolf and lynx. Anthropogenic factors (hunting harvest, roads, and built-up area) positively correlated with the gradient of FGM levels in both species. Both the mean and the variance of the FGM concentrations measured within populations of both red deer and roe deer were affected positively by variation in hunting harvest and negatively by the minimum temperature. The variance in the roe deer FGM was also positively influenced by the percentage of built-up areas. The results indicate that stress in wild ungulate populations is lower and less variable in areas utilized by large carnivores than in carnivore-free areas where human-related factors predominate. This may be explained by evolutionary adaptations of prey animals constantly exposed to the risk of natural predation and their inability of adapting to the risk from humans probably due to its high intensity and erratic occurrence.","[Zbyryt, Adam] Polish Soc Bird Protect PTOP, Ciepla 17, PL-15471 Bialystok, Poland; [Bubnicki, Jakub W.; Kuijper, Dries P.

This hypothesis has been supported in the context of recreational activity in natural environments but it is unknown whether it also applies to urban animals. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the sentinel (territorial vigilance), foraging and vocal behaviours of an urban-dwelling bird, the Rufous Hornero Furnarius rufus, between weekdays and weekends (and holidays) within a university campus in central Brazil. The level of human activity (noise, traffic and pedestrian flow) increases greatly on weekdays on this campus. We predicted that the birds would perceive a greater predation risk and would need to adjust their acoustic signals in response to anthropogenic noise on weekdays. Thus, we expected that the birds would spend more time as sentinels and less time foraging, and would sing for longer periods and at a higher pitch on weekdays than on weekends. We also expected weaker duet responsiveness (answering partner-initiated song) on noisier weekdays than on weekends, assuming that noise would disrupt signal transmission between partners. We found that birds spent slightly more time (similar to 4%) in sentinel behaviour and less time (similar to 2-5%) foraging on weekdays than on weekends, but these effects were small and not statistically significant. Birds were equally likely to sing solos, start duets and answer partner-initiated duets on weekends and weekdays. Finally, phrase duration and acoustic parameters of duets were similar on weekends and weekdays. Our results provide little support for the weekend effect hypothesis, suggesting that these urban-dwelling birds may be habituated or indifferent to periodic variation in human activity levels.","[Diniz, Pedro; Silva-Jr, Edvaldo F.] Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Diniz, Pedro; Silva-Jr, Edvaldo F.; Macedo, Regina H.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Zool, Lab Comportamento Anim, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,"Diniz, P (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.; Diniz, P (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Dept Zool, Lab Comportamento Anim, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",pdadiniz@gmail.com; edjuninhof@gmail.com; rhfmacedo@unb.br,"Diniz, Pedro/C-6994-2019; Macedo, Regina/C-1411-2013","Diniz, Pedro/0000-0002-3193-6376; Silva-Jr, Edvaldo/0000-0003-2685-738X; Macedo, Regina/0000-0003-3510-9172",,,,96,0,0,3,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,OCT,2021,163,4,,,,,1394,1408,,10.1111/ibi.12956,,,15,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Zoology,UR2MC,WOS:000696587200018,,,,,2022-04-19,

Because synchronized vigilance deviates from the classical vigilance models, which assume independent scanning, it is important to understand when and why it occurs. We explored vigilance behavior of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in a population subject to spatial variation in human hunting risk and seasonal variation in food availability. Group members synchronized their vigilance behavior. We hypothesized that vigilance synchronization would be context dependent and the trade-off between energy gain and safety would shape the relationship between the degree of vigilance synchronization and group size. We predicted weaker synchronization in large groups under heavy predation risk, due to benefits of numerical dilution, and stronger synchronization in large groups when food is limiting, due to intense food competition. The degree of synchronization decreased with increasing group size in the area where human hunting added another risk factor to the natural predation, pointing at the safety benefits of vigilance synchrony for members of small groups and the role of human-induced risk in shaping vigilance synchrony. We found no relation between vigilance synchrony and group size in a food scarce, winter season. However, low levels of vigilance and its synchronization observed in winter indicated that energy gain was prioritized over safety. Thus, members of wild boar groups can adjust levels of vigilance and its synchronization depending on the forage-risk trade-off set by the ecological context.","[Podgorski, Tomasz; Bubnicki, Jakub W.; Kuijper, Dries P.

The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey is expected to adjust key anti-predator behaviours such as vigilance to temporal variation in risk. We tested the predictions of the risk allocation hypothesis in a natural environment where both a species-rich natural predator community and human hunters are abundant and where the differences in seasonal and circadian activity between natural and anthropogenic predators provided a unique opportunity to quantify the contributions of different predator classes to anti-predator behaviour. Whereas natural predators were expected to show similar levels of activity throughout the seasons, hunter activity was high during the daytime during a clearly defined hunting season. According to the risk allocation hypothesis, vigilance should then be higher during the hunting season and during daytime hours than during the non-hunting season and night-time hours. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) on the edge of Biaowiea Primeval Forest in Eastern Poland displayed vigilance behaviour consistent with these predictions. The behavioural response of roe deer to temporarily varying predation risks emphasises the behavioural plasticity of this species and suggests that future studies of anti-predator behaviour need to incorporate circadian variation in predation pressure as well as risk gradients of both natural and anthropogenic predators.","[Soennichsen, Leif; Hofer, Heribert; Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie; Ortmann, Sylvia] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Res Grp Evolutionary Ecol, D-10315 Berlin, Germany; [Soennichsen, Leif; Jedrzejewska, Bogumila] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Bokje, Matthijs; Marchal, Jessica] Van Hall Larenstein, Leeuwarden, Netherlands",,"Sonnichsen, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Res Grp Evolutionary Ecol, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.",soennichsen@izw-berlin.de,"Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/A-8778-2013; Hofer, Heribert/AAF-7854-2021; Ortmann, Sylvia/B-7088-2015","Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/0000-0002-9269-4446; Hofer, Heribert/0000-0002-2813-7442; Ortmann, Sylvia/0000-0003-2520-6251; Jedrzejewska, Bogumila/0000-0002-9652-0953","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [KBN nr 2 PO4F 028 29]; Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany","We are grateful to W.

Risk is likely perceived differently by individuals in relation to among-individual differences in correlated behavioral traits, that is, syndromes or personalities. Given that animals can avoid the risk of predation/disturbance through modification of their habitat use, we might expect individuals of differing behavioral types to adopt contrasting tactics of habitat use when faced with risky or stressful situations. We studied the relationship between habitat use and among-individual variation in behavioral profile in a population of roe deer. We hypothesized that an individual's habitat use tactics should be related to their capacity to cope with risky situations. In particular, we predicted that more reactive (risk-averse) roe deer, with relatively high behavioral response and high body temperature at capture, long flight distances and which were more vigilant during feeding, should use riskier open habitat less, particularly when risk is high. We found that although the use of open habitat during the day was negatively correlated with the indices of reactivity at capture, it was also positively correlated with indices of reactivity while foraging in open habitat. Furthermore, most of the behavioral parameters we measured were intercorrelated and moderately repeatable, potentially indexing personality traits. We conclude that there is substantial interindividual variability in how individuals manage risky situations which imposes constraints on how they are able to exploit high-risk habitats, suggesting the existence of a risk management syndrome in this large herbivore.","[Bonnot, Nadege; Verheyden, Helene; Debeffe, Lucie; Cargnelutti, Bruno; Hewison, A.

The increased human presence has modified fishes' antipredator behavioural responses, and consequently flight decisions, as a function of their changed perceptions of risk. Understanding how fish react to human presence can help identify the most vulnerable functional groups/species and estimate impacts caused by human disturbance. Shoal and body size are known to influence fish flight initiation distance (FID; the distance between the predator and prey when the prey begins to escape); however, few studies attempt to test the moderators of these relationships. Here, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating FID of fish in response to human presence. Specifically, we investigated six candidate moderators that could influence the relationship between FID with shoal and body size. Our results showed that individual fish size was strongly and positively correlated with FID and the most important moderator that explained the variance in individual body size-FID relationship was shoaling behaviour. However, and somehow surprisingly, we detected no significant relationship between shoal size and FID. We discuss how these results can inform the development of fish conservation strategies and ultimately assist in the management of marine protected areas.","[Samia, Diogo S.

Therefore, we hypothesized that disturbances from small and big game hunting may have negative effects on moose movements, diurnal activity, and activity range. Using location data from 64 moose equipped with GPS collars from three populations (Low Alpine, Inland, Coastal) with different temporal human presence and spatial accessibility, we evaluated the impact of hunting on moose activity rhythms. On average, female moose in the low human population density (Low Alpine) area (< 0.5/km(2)) had significantly lower movement rates during moose hunting season, but variation in movement rates among individuals were higher compared with female moose in regions with denser human populations (6-24/km(2)). We found no evidence that reproductive status influenced female moose sensitivity to disturbance. As expected, females used smaller activity ranges and were less active nocturnally than males. The high within-group variation suggests that current hunting disturbance levels do not alter moose population behavior in general. Our data indicate that alterations in movement were related to rutting activity, not human disturbance induced by hunting. In line with behavioral theory, our study suggests that some individuals were more sensitive to hunting disturbance than the general population. Our work suggests that individual moose may perceive human predation risk to be similar to other predation risks.","[Neumann, Wiebke; Ericsson, Goran; Dettki, Holger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",,"Neumann, W (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Wiebke.Neumann@vfm.slu.se,,"Neumann, Wiebke/0000-0002-0000-4816",,,,76,21,21,4,77,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Urbanisation and anthropogenic alteration of ecosystems has led to conflict between humans and wildlife. Such conflict is often observed in apex predators. Although human-wildlife conflict has been extensively studied, male/female differences in behaviour are rarely considered. 2. We investigated male/female differences in foraging behaviour of the predatory/scavenging brown skua Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi breeding on a New Zealand island nature reserve in proximity to farmland. These skuas are subject to culling, when perceived as a threat to livestock. 3. As part of a long-term ecological study, we used high-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to characterise the space-use of foraging brown skuas. We also analysed stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) from modern and archived blood samples to investigate possible changes in diet over the past similar to 30 years. 4. Analysis of 100 GPS tracks collected from 2014 to 2016 demonstrated that males and females consistently visited different habitats. Males spent most of their time close to their breeding territory on the island nature reserve and females frequently visited a farmed island approximately two kilometres away. Consistent with this finding, we show that male and female skuas also differed markedly in their diets: males specialised on burrow-nesting white-faced storm petrels Pelagodroma marina (80%) with only a small proportion of sheep remains Ovis aries (<6%) contributing to their diet. In contrast, female diet comprised 27% white-faced storm petrels, other seabirds (18%) and a relatively large proportion of sheep remains (47%). Further, our data (186 blood samples from 122 individuals) show that this male/female difference in diet has persisted at least since 1987. 5. Because females fed disproportionally on sheep remains, they may be more vulnerable to being culled by farmers. Importantly, our case study suggests that intersexual differences in diet and foraging patterns can have major implications for the reproduction and survival of apex predators that interact with farming. We strongly suggest that intersexual differences in behaviour should be considered when investigating human-wildlife conflicts.","[Schultz, Hendrik; Chang, Kevin; Gaskett, Anne C.; Ismar-Rebitz, Stefanie M.

Changing risk landscapes may reduce benefits associated with home range fidelity, however, and philopatric animals may alter movement in response to new pressures. Despite the importance of range changes to ecological and evolutionary processes, little tracking data have been collected over the long-term nor has range change been recorded in response to human pressures across generations. Here, we investigate the relationships between ecological, demographic and human variables and elephant ranging behaviour across generations using 16 years of tracking data from nine distinct female social groups in a population of elephants in northern Kenya that was heavily affected by ivory poaching during the latter half of the study. Nearly all groups-including those that did not experience loss of mature adults- exhibited a shift north over time, apparently in response to increased poaching in the southern extent of the study area. However, loss of mature adults appeared to be the primary indicator of range shifts and expansions, as generational turnover was a significant predictor of range size increases and range centroid shifts. Range expansions and northward shifts were associated with higher primary productivity and lower poached carcass densities, while westward shifts exhibited a trend to areas with higher values of primary productivity and higher poached carcass densities relative to former ranges. Together these results suggest a trade-off between resource access, mobility and safety. We discuss the relevance of these results to elephant conservation efforts and directions meriting further exploration in this disrupted society of a keystone species.","[Goldenberg, Shifra Z.; Wittemyer, George] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Goldenberg, Shifra Z.; Douglas-Hamilton, Iain; Wittemyer, George] Save Elephants, Nairobi 00200, Kenya; [Douglas-Hamilton, Iain] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England",,"Goldenberg, SZ (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.; Goldenberg, SZ (corresponding author), Save Elephants, Nairobi 00200, Kenya.",shifra.z.goldenberg@gmail.com,,"Goldenberg, Shifra/0000-0002-9468-8920",Save the Elephants; WorldWomenWork,We are grateful to private donors of Save the Elephants and WorldWomenWork for funding this study.,,62,14,14,1,43,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

However, despite many theoretical similarities between predator-prey and host-parasite interactions, nonconsumptive effects of parasites on their hosts remain poorly understood. Further, such effects may be of consequence to human and wildlife health, when host-parasite interactions involve hematophagous arthropods that vector infectious diseases. We used giving-up density estimation techniques to measure the response of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to the risk of parasitism by lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum), an important vector of several infectious diseases in the southeastern United States. We also deployed carnivore scent stations to estimate activity levels of potential deer predators, conducted deer dung count surveys to control for effects of deer abundance, and controlled for topographic aspect, a primary determinant of vegetative biomass and community composition. We found a significant, positive correlation between giving-up densities in deer and the densities of A. americanum, but no effect of canid predators, deer abundance, or topographic aspect. Our results are consistent with the few other empirical examples that demonstrate nonconsumptive effects of parasites on their hosts. Considering that host-parasite interactions have enormous potential to influence the prevalence of vector-borne diseases that affect human health, incorporating indirect effects of parasites on their hosts into infectious disease ecology may be necessary to effectively mitigate disease risk.","[Allan, Brian F.; Chase, Jonathan M.] Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, Eureka, MO 63025 USA; [Allan, Brian F.; Varns, Theodore S.; Chase, Jonathan M.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",,"Allan, BF (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Entomol, 320 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61853 USA.",ballan@life.illinois.edu,,,Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Tyson Research Center; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency,"We thank Rachael Katz and Nathan Varns for their assistance with field research, David Allan, Leon Blaustein, Rick Ostfeld, and the Chase lab group for helpful comments and discussion, and the staff of the Tyson Research Center for their logistical support.

Information transfer among organisms during such events is thought to confer important antipredator advantages. However, it remains unknown whether individuals in large aggregations can change the structural properties of their collective in response to higher predation risk, and if so whether such adjustments promote responsiveness and information transfer. We examined the role of risk perception on the schooling dynamics and collective evasions of a large herring, Clupea harengus, school (ca. 60 000 fish) during simulated-predator encounters in a sea cage. Using an echosounder, high-resolution imaging sonar and acoustic video analysis, we quantified swimming dynamics, collective reactions and the speed of the propagating waves of evasion induced by a mobile predator model. In the higher risk condition, fish swam faster, exhibited a stronger circular swimming pattern, and we found an increased correlation strength indicating that the school had a greater ability to collectively respond to a perturbation. When exposed to a simulated threat, collective evasions were stronger and behavioural change (evasion manoeuvres) propagated more quickly within the school under environmental conditions perceived as being more risky. Our results demonstrate that large schools make structural and behavioural adjustments in response to perceived risk in a way that improves collective information transfer, and thus responsiveness, during predator attacks.

These nonlethal costs can impact their reproductive success and survival. One strategy that prey can use to minimize these costs is to adjust their antipredator behavior based on the perceived level of risk. We tested whether humans adopt this strategy by presenting participants with photographic arrays of predators (lions) that varied in their level of risk. While their eye movements were recorded, the participants searched for a forwardfacing predator (signifying potential predator interest; high-risk target) among an array of inattentive predators that were facing away (low-risk distractors) or searched for a predator that was facing away from them among an array of forward-facing predators. As a control, participants also searched through similar arrays that displayed a potential prey species (impalas) rather than predators. Participants detected forward-facing predators more quickly than predators facing away from them. Unexpectedly, they were also quicker at detecting forward-facing prey versus prey facing away from them, but slower to detect these forward-facing prey compared with forward-facing predators. They were slower to detect predators and prey facing away from them because they spent more time looking at the forward-facing distractors and looked at more of those distractors. The results indicate that human attention is drawn toward dangerous predators with forward-facing orientations, and this could allow humans to quickly assess predator intentions.","[Yorzinski, Jessica L.; Tovar, Maria E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, 534 John Kimbrough Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Coss, Richard G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Yorzinski, JL (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, 534 John Kimbrough Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",jyorzinski@tamu.edu,,,College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Texas AM University; Texas A& M AgriLife Research; Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences at Texas AM University,Jessica L.

When exposed to potentially lethal human actions, such as hunting or fishing, fish, and wildlife are expected to behaviourally respond by becoming shyer and learning when to be cautious. Using a rich dataset collected in temperate rocky reefs, we provide evidence of spearfishing-induced behavioural changes in five coastal fish taxa, exposed to different levels of spearfishing exploitation, by using flight initiation distance (FID) as a proxy of predator avoidance. We detected a significant increase of mean and size effects of FID when the observer was equipped with a speargun. Such effects were more evident outside marine protected areas where spearfishing was allowed and was commensurate to the historically spearfishing pressure of each investigated taxon. Our results demonstrate the ability of fish to develop finetuned antipredator responses and to recognize the risks posed by spearfishers as human predators. This capacity is likely acquired by learning, but harvest-induced truncation of the behavioural diversity and fisheries-induced evolution may also play a role and help to explain the increased timidity shown by the exploited fishes in our study.","[Sbragaglia, Valerio; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Sbragaglia, Valerio; Morroni, Lorenzo; Azzurro, Ernesto] Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Via Cedro 38, I-57122 Livorno, Italy; [Morroni, Lorenzo] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [Bramanti, Lorenzo] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Lab Ecogeochim Environm Benth LECOB, Observ Oceanolog Banyuls Sur Mer, 1 Ave Pierre Fabre, F-66650 Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Weitzmann, Boris] Illes Medes & El Baix Ter Lestartit, Parc Nat Montgri, Catalunya, Spain; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Crop & Anim Sci, Div Integrat Fisheries Management, Invalidenstr 42, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Azzurro, Ernesto] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn SZN, I-80121 Naples, Italy",,"Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.; Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Inst Environm Protect & Res ISPRA, Via Cedro 38, I-57122 Livorno, Italy.",valeriosbra@gmail.com,"Arlinghaus, Robert/J-6171-2019; sbragaglia, valerio/ABA-7409-2020; Bramanti, Lorenzo/AAH-5094-2021; Arlinghaus, Robert/E-3340-2010; Bramanti, Lorenzo/M-5492-2013; sbragaglia, valerio/AAB-1507-2019","sbragaglia, valerio/0000-0002-4775-7049; Bramanti, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4872-840X; Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X; Bramanti, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4872-840X; Azzurro, Ernesto/0000-0002-9805-3164",Leibniz-DAAD postdoctoral research fellowship [91632699],"We are grateful to the management body of Bonifacio Straits Natural Reserve, and warmly acknowledge the support provided by Michel Culioli.

In many damselflies, sexual dimorphism occurs jointly with multiple female colour morphs. Typically, one morph is coloured like the male (andromorph), while the other(s) is not (gynomorph(s)). The mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of such female polymorphism in damselflies remain poorly understood, especially the role of predation. We tested the detectability of two different female colour morphs of the damselfly, Enallagma cyathigerum, using human observers as model predators; andromorphs were detected more frequently than gynomorphs. Field data on mortality of males and the two different female morphs due to predation or drowning were also collected, and these observations support morph-specific mortality. In natural populations predation risk was higher in males than females; gynomorphs, however, were more prone to predation than andromorphs.

In this study, several toxic metals: cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, and copper were quantified in different tissues (digestive tract, muscle, skeleton, skin) of nine fish species (Neogobius melanostomus, Belone belone, Solea solea, Trachurus mediterraneus ponticus, Sardina pilchardus, Engraulis encrasicolus, Pomatomus saltatrix, Sprattus sprattus, Scorpaena porcus) by using atomic absorption spectrometer with a high-resolution continuum source and graphite furnace technique (HR-CS GF-AAS), and the risk of fish meat consumption by the young human population was evaluated. These metals are used in high amounts in industries located near the coastline such as shipyard construction and industrial plants. Toxic metal accumulation depends on fish feeding behavior, abiotic conditions, metal chemistry, and animal physiology. For instance, cadmium was measured in the muscle of the investigated species and average values of 0.0008-0.0338 mg kg(-1) were obtained. The lowest average value of this metal was measured at benthic species N. melanostomus and the highest at the pelagic predator T. mediterraneus ponticus. Generally, the highest metal concentration was measured in the digestive tract that has the role of biofilter for these contaminants. The risk of contamination is significantly reduced by avoiding the consumption of certain fish tissues (digestive tract and skin for copper and skeleton for nickel). An estimation of the dietary metal intake to young consumers was realized for each of the studied species of fish from Romanian, Bulgarian, and Turkish waters, during the period 2001-2014 in order to evaluate the risks of chronic exposure in time due to metal toxicity. This estimation is important for the prevention of chronic exposure due to metal toxicity. Food exposure to studied metals showed a negative trend for Romania, Turkey, and Bulgaria based on the data provided by this study. The young consumers were highly exposed to these elements during the 2001-2006 period as proven by the results from this study.","[Plavan, Gabriel; Nicoara, Mircea] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Biol, Bd Carol 1,20A, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Jitar, Oana; Teodosiu, Carmen] Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Dept Environm Engn & Management, 73 Prof Dr D Mangeron St, Iasi 700050, Romania; [Micu, Dragos] Natl Inst Marine Res & Dev Grigore Antipa, Constanta 300 Mamaia Blvd, Constanta 900581, Romania; [Strungaru, Stefan-Adrian] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Res, Bd Carol 1,20A, Iasi 700505, Romania",,"Teodosiu, C (corresponding author), Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Dept Environm Engn & Management, 73 Prof Dr D Mangeron St, Iasi 700050, Romania.",cteo@ch.tuiasi.ro,"Plavan, Gabriel-Ionut/H-9147-2019; MICU, DRAGOS/Z-5776-2019; Mircea, Nicoara/J-3886-2019; Teodosiu, Carmen/E-2693-2012","Strungaru, Stefan-Adrian/0000-0001-7958-4923; Plavan, Gabriel Ionut/0000-0002-1194-1768",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi [GI-2015-11],"This work was partially funded by the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi, the project no.

In mothers, predator-induced stress can reduce reproductive fitness and alter offspring phenotypes. Acting via these generational, maternal stress effects, predation risk may continue to influence the demography of prey populations even when the predators are no longer present. The 10-year snowshoe hare cycle is the classic top-down predator-driven example in nature and is caused both by direct mortality and by indirect risk effects. During the decline phase, virtually, all hares die because they are killed and simultaneously hares exhibit pronounced stress effects caused by high predation risk. However, the rapidity of the decline phase varies among cycles. When the decline is extremely rapid, we expect that the risk experienced by hares is much greater than when the decline is prolonged. The enigma of these cycles is the low phase following the decline, when there is little or no population growth in spite of the absence of predators and ample food. Previously, we have shown that predator-induced maternal stress decreases reproduction and compromises the offspring stress axis. Here, we examine how the severity of predation risk during six separate population declines is related to the length of the subsequent low phase. We show that the more severe the decline, as indicated by the greater rate of loss of hares, the longer the subsequent low phase. These results support the hypothesis that the greater the degree of risk, the longer the generational impact on population demography (the longer the low phase of the hare population). Our findings have broad applicability to conservation and management efforts; even when a stressor (predator, human disturbance) is removed or when exposure may be short term (drought, fire or translocation), the signature of the stressor may be evident over several future generations.","[Sheriff, M.

We applied predation risk and life history theories to examine how parallel laser beams, which provide a scale for estimating transect width and the sizes of fish and habitat features, might bias groundfish counts during visual surveys conducted with a towed video camera. The laser beams project forward as dots onto the benthos, and species differ in their propensity to chase them. We hypothesized that fish perceive the laser dots as potential food and the camera, which lags behind the dots while moving forward, as a generalized threat. Analyses accounted for species primary diet and tested the prediction that shorter-lived species are more likely to chase the laser dots than longer-lived species, but these differences should weaken in the perceived safety of larger groups. Consistent with our predictions, the probability that fish would chase the laser dots decreased with the maximum age of species and increased with group size, although these effects were independent of each other. Also, chase probabilities were approximate to 20 to 25 times greater for species known to include benthic mobile prey in their diet than for species that feed primarily on pelagic, sessile or low-mobility prey. Our results suggest that risk-foraging trade-offs are inherent to fish behaviors that might bias surveys counts. While further insight into species differences is still needed, we illustrate how group size- and species-specific chase probabilities can generate bias correction factors to improve surveys counts.","[Frid, Alejandro; McGreer, Madeleine] Cent Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, 2790 Vargo Rd, Campbell River, BC V9W 4X1, Canada; [Frid, Alejandro] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, POB 1700 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Frid, Twyla] 352 Creek Rd, Bowen Isl, BC V0N 1G1, Canada",,"Frid, A (corresponding author), Cent Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, 2790 Vargo Rd, Campbell River, BC V9W 4X1, Canada.",alejfrid@gmail.com,,,Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation [1406.03]; AAROM [ARM2015-MLT-7006-3]; MaPP [CCS P098-06143]; Tula Foundation; Canada's federal HSP program [21014HSP6834]; AFSAR program [2017AFSAR3044],"AF and MM are supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (grant 1406.03, 2016/17), AAROM (grant ARM2015-MLT-7006-3, 2016/17), MaPP (grant CCS P098-06143, 2016/17), and the Tula Foundation.

However, relatively little is known about how predators affect herbivore diet selection. We examined diets of 2 common reef herbivores, Sparisoma aurofrenatum and Acanthurus coeruleus, in the Florida Keys, across sites of varying predator biomass. We used stable isotope analysis to understand the importance of predation risk relative to other known drivers of herbivore foraging decisions. For S. aurofrenatum, we found that greater predator biomass was associated with an increase in the diversity of resources consumed within populations. In contrast, increasing densities of damselfishes, which aggressively defend resource-rich algal gardens, were associated with lower diet diversity. However, within A. coeruleus populations, diet diversity increased with damselfish abundance, but was unrelated to predator biomass. Stomach content analyses and direct observation of diet selection in the field corroborated the stable isotope analysis. Importantly, both predator and damselfish abundance impacted diet diversity in different ways for these 2 fishes, which may be linked to differences in sociality and group foraging. A. coeruleus is more likely to forage in schools, potentially reducing predation risk and allowing them to overwhelm damselfishes and access their territories. Interestingly, damselfish abundance was positively correlated with predator biomass, suggesting that predators may influence herbivore diets indirectly via altered densities or behavior of damselfishes. Our work argues for more emphasis on the role of predation risk in affecting herbivore foraging in order to understand the implications of human-mediated predator removal and recovery in coral reef ecosystems.","[Catano, Laura B.; Shantz, Andrew A.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miami, FL 33181 USA",,"Catano, LB (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",lbhatti@fiu.edu,,"Shantz, Andrew/0000-0001-5641-8914","PADI Foundation Grant; Florida Sea Grant Scholar award; National Science Foundation, Biological OceanographyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1130786]; College of Arts and Sciences at Florida International University","L.B.C. and D.E.B. designed the study; L.B.C., A.A.S., and D.E.B. performed the research; L.B.C. conducted statistical analyses; L.B.C. and D.E.B. wrote the manuscript; A.A.S. contributed to editing the manuscript.

Nonetheless, terrestrial locomotion is a widespread adaptation that has arisen repeatedly within the primate lineage. The absence of terrestriality among the New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) is thus notable and raises questions about the ecological pressures that constrain the expansion of platyrrhines into terrestrial niches. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment, comparing patterns of terrestrial behavior in white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) living on two islands off the Pacific coast of Panama that lack mammalian predators (island sites) with the behavior of capuchins at three sites in central Panama with more intact predator communities (mainland sites). Surveys with camera traps revealed increased terrestriality in island vs. mainland sites. Capuchin detection rates were higher, the range of party sizes observed was larger, and individuals engaged in a wider range of terrestrial behaviors on the islands lacking mammalian predators. Furthermore, females carrying infants were frequently photographed on the ground at the island sites, but never at the mainland sites. These findings support the long-standing hypothesis that predators constrain the exploitation of terrestrial niches by primates. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that arboreal locomotion imposes costs that primates will avoid by walking on the ground when predation risk is low. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Illegal human behaviour such as those affecting natural resource use or resulting from humanwildlife conflicts threaten the sustainable management of ecosystems and the conservation of biodiversity worldwide. However, the frequently scarce and incomplete data owing to the sensitive nature of illegal activities pose a challenge to developing tools to properly understand and prevent those activities. 2. We used species distribution models to identify factors related to a prominent illegal activity, wildlife poisoning, and to produce detailed, spatially explicit maps of the risk of occurrence in NW Spain. We alleviated the constraints of imperfect information and occurrence of absences by using presence-only methods, that is, maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt). To our knowledge, this is the first time that this method has been used in the context of illegal activities affecting wildlife. 3. A total of 112 poisoning events involving 228 individuals of 25 different species were reported in the study area from 2000 to 2010. Most of the reported deaths (90.8%) were birds of prey (52.6%) and mammalian carnivores (38.2%), of which 95.2% were scavengers. Illegal poisoning affected eleven species classified as endangered at national and/or global level. 4. Our models highlighted the perceived risk of livestock predation by wolves Canis lupus, although not by bears Ursus arctos, as a major motivation for poisoning. The existence of protected areas was positively correlated to this illegal practice, while socioeconomic factors had less influence on predicting its occurrence. Over 56% of the study area was predicted to be under risk of illegal poisoning. 5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a new use for presence-only models, illustrated using MaxEnt, to assist conservation managers dealing with illegal activities. This approach allows the main causes of an illegal practice to be identified and generates spatially explicit risk maps. Managers can take advantage of this modelling approach to allocate the scarce resources available in conservation to key sectors and locations. In our study system, actions against illegal poisoning should aim to resolve the potential conflict existing between cattle-farming and wolves, especially in protected areas.","[Mateo-Tomas, Patricia; Sanchez-Barbudo, Ines S.; Mateo, Rafael] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Olea, Pedro P.] IE Univ, Sch Biol, Segovia 40003, Spain",,"Mateo-Tomas, P (corresponding author), CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo S-N, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",rktespejos@gmail.com,"Mateo, Rafael/AAU-1480-2020; Mateo-Tomás, Patricia/L-8471-2014; Mateo, Rafael/A-3117-2011; Olea, Pedro P/M-1502-2014","Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152; Mateo-Tomás, Patricia/0000-0001-6762-9514; Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152; Olea, Pedro P/0000-0001-5387-9598",Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La ManchaJunta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha; Fondo Social EuropeoEuropean Social Fund (ESF)European Commission,"We thank C.

The gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is a species of conservation significance due to its important role as an ecosystem engineer and habitat loss due to human activities. In this study, we examined escape responses of gopher tortoises approached by a human observer. Our data supported our prediction that the level of disturbance would influence escape responses, with animals that were picked and handled taking longer to emerge and move off than animals that had simply been approached or approached and walked around. We also found that tortoises took half as long to extend their heads at our study site, where tortoises exposed to a high level of benign human activity over a long period, compared with an adjacent site where there had been minimal human interaction with tortoises. These data suggest that gopher tortoises adjust their escape responses according to the level of risk they are exposed to. Over the long-team, this plasticity in escape responses can potentially result in some level of habituation to human presence.","[Bateman, P.

We hypothesized that blackbuck would show flexible habitat-use behaviour and be risk averse when resource quality in the landscape is high, and less sensitive to risk otherwise. Overall, blackbuck appeared to be strongly influenced by human activity and they offset risks by using small protected patches (similar to 3 km(2)) when they could afford to do so. Blackbuck habitat use varied dynamically corresponding with seasonally-changing levels of resources and risks, with protected habitats registering maximum use. The findings show that human activities can strongly influence and perhaps limit ungulate habitat-use and behaviour, but spatial heterogeneity in risk, particularly the presence of refuges, can allow ungulates to persist in landscapes with high human and livestock densities.","[Krishna, Yarlagadda Chaitanya; Isvaran, Kavita] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; [Krishna, Yarlagadda Chaitanya] Manipal Univ, Manipal, Karnataka, India; [Krishna, Yarlagadda Chaitanya; Kumar, Ajith] Wildlife Conservat Soc, India Program, Ctr Wildlife Studies, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",,"Krishna, YC (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.; Krishna, YC (corresponding author), Manipal Univ, Manipal, Karnataka, India.; Krishna, YC (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, India Program, Ctr Wildlife Studies, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.",chethikrishna@yahoo.com,,,"Royal Norwegian Embassy, New Delhi; Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India","This study was funded by grants from the Royal Norwegian Embassy, New Delhi (http://www.norwayemb.org.in/) and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India (http://www.moef.nic.in/) to KI.",,34,9,11,1,20,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 17,2016,11,3,,,,,,,e0151748,10.1371/journal.pone.0151748,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DH1YG,WOS:000372580300122,26985668,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2022-04-19,

We found that: (1) highly disturbed individuals have shorter FIDs and smaller standard deviation of FID relative to undisturbed individuals, but there was no difference between lowly disturbed and undisturbed individuals. The diversifications arise possibly because extensive disturbance enhances the risk perception threshold of highly disturbed marmots but their lowly disturbed congeners; (2) the DF of highly disturbed individuals was shorter than undisturbed individuals, possibly because heavy disturbances drive reproductive pairs to dig more burrows in the habitat, resulting in the reduced inter-burrow distance and thus decreased DF. No similar diversifications were observed between lowly disturbed individuals and individuals in the other two populations, possibly because reproductive pairs from low disturbance population concentrate their burrows, resulting in shorter DF when they are near their burrows, but longer DF when they are farther away; and (3) unlike lowly and undisturbed marmots, FID of highly disturbed individuals under different DFs differed significantly, potentially because shorter inter-burrow distance reduced their flight costs, resulting in more tolerance of human proximity. Nevertheless, the DF-derived risk perception threshold of undisturbed and lowly disturbed individuals drives them to prioritize fleeing when threatened. Generally, the escape response of Himalayan marmots under different human disturbances is determined by the interaction between predation risk and flight costs.","[Guo, Cheng; Zhou, Shuailing; Xiang, Zuofu] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Krzton, Ali] Auburn Univ, RBD Lib, Dept Res & Instruct, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",,"Xiang, ZF (corresponding author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Foresty, 498 Shaoshan Nanlu, Changsha 410018, Hunan, Peoples R China.",xiangzf@csuft.edu.cn,,"Guo, Cheng/0000-0002-4419-7285",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); State Forestry and Grassland Administration Bureau of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China; State Forestry and Grassland Administration Bureau of China,,56,0,0,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2022,128,2,,,,,143,151,,10.1111/eth.13248,,NOV 2021,9,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,XZ2LG,WOS:000716171800001,,,,,2022-04-19,

Mosquitoes Aedes triseriatus (Say) and Auks albopictus (Skuse) encounter predatory Corethrella appendiculata (Grabham) and Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett) in small containers and show antipredatory behavioral responses. We investigated the sources of the predation cues to which these prey larvae respond. We tested whether Ae. albopictus larvae show behavioral responses to cues emanating from the predator or from damage to prey caused by the act of predation. We also tested whether Ae. triseriatus respond to cues present in fluid or solid residues from predator activity. Ae. albopictus showed behavioral modifications only in response to waterborne cues from a feeding predator and not to cues from a starving predator, indicating that Ae. albopictus respond to cues created by the act of predation, which could include substances derived from damaged prey or substances in predator feces. Ae. triseriatus showed behavioral responses to solid residues from predation but not to fluid without those solids, indicating that the cues to which they respond originate in predator feces or uneaten prey body parts. Our results suggest that cues in this system may be primarily chemicals that are detected upon contact with solid residues that are products of the feeding processes of these predators.","[Kesavaraju, Banugopan; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA",,"Kesavaraju, B (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",banu@slcmad.org,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",National Institutes of Health National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (Illinois State University)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI-44793]; National Science Foundation (Illinois State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0507015]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,We thank M.

Although diminished neophobia, resulting from a safer environment and more free time, has been proposed to underlie these differences among settings, less is known about how captivity influences exploration tendency. Here, we refer to the combination of reduced neophobia and increased interest in exploring novelty as curiosity, which we systematically compared across seven groups of captive and wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) by exposing them to a test battery of eight novel stimuli. In the wild sample, we included both monkeys habituated to human presence and unhabituated individuals filmed using motion-triggered cameras. Results revealed clear differences in number of approaches to novel stimuli among captive, wild-habituated and wild-unhabituated monkeys. As foraging pressure and predation risks are assumed to be equal for all wild monkeys, our results do not support a relationship between curiosity and safety or free time. Instead, we propose the habituation hypothesis as an explanation of why well-habituated and captive monkeys both approached and explored novelty more than unhabituated individuals. We conclude that varying levels of human and/or human artefact habituation, rather than the risks present in natural environments, better explain variation in curiosity in our sample of vervet monkeys.","[Forss, Sofia Ingrid Fredrika; Motes-Rodrigo, Alba; Dongre, Pooja; Mohr, Tecla; van de Waal, Erica] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Forss, Sofia Ingrid Fredrika; Dongre, Pooja; Mohr, Tecla; van de Waal, Erica] Mawana Game Reserve, Inkawu Vervet Project, ZA-3115 Pretoria, South Africa; [Forss, Sofia Ingrid Fredrika] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Motes-Rodrigo, Alba] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Dept Early Prehist & Quaternary Ecol, Tubingen, Germany",,"Forss, SIF (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Forss, SIF (corresponding author), Mawana Game Reserve, Inkawu Vervet Project, ZA-3115 Pretoria, South Africa.; Forss, SIF (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",sofia.forss@ieu.uzh.ch,,"Forss, Sofia/0000-0002-6551-1907","Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ZurichETH Zurich; Wenner-Gren Foundation, USA; Waldemar von Frenckell Foundation, Finland; Swiss National Science Foundation, SwitzerlandSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [PP00P3_170624]","Open access funding provided by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich.

Studies have shown that pronghorn antelope, Antilocapra americana (Ord, 1815), are influenced by human disturbances. We examined several intensities of human activity and distance from disturbances as indicators of risk perception in pronghorns. We investigated whether pronghorns exhibited risk-avoidance behaviour towards road traffic consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis by comparing vigilance and foraging behaviour observations across increasing traffic levels and proximity to roads. Pronghorns showed higher vigilance and lower foraging times along high traffic roads during the spring season compared with lower traffic levels, suggesting that risk perception is related to traffic level. Moreover, individuals within close proximity to roads regardless of traffic level exhibited higher vigilance levels, indicating that there is an overall risk perceived towards roads. Our results also suggest that individuals in herds with young are more risk averse than other social groupings and individuals in larger groups perceive less risk. We suggest that consequences of risk-avoidance behaviour should be reflected in land-use plans that address road densities and traffic levels to better manage wildlife.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",,"Gavin, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",shannon.gavin@mses.ca,,,,,,23,46,55,1,54,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA-N R C RESEARCH PRESS,OTTAWA,"BUILDING M 55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

This risk might have been a selective pressure on the evolution of primate visual and cognitive systems, leading to several behavioral traits present in human and non-human primates, such as the ability to quickly learn to fear snakes. Primates seldom prey on snakes, and humans are one of the few primate species that do. We report here another case, the wild capuchin monkey (Sapajus libidinosus), which preys on snakes. We hypothesized that capuchin monkeys, due to their behavioral plasticity, and cognitive and visual skills, would be capable of discriminating dangerous and non-dangerous snakes and behave accordingly. We recorded the behavioral patterns exhibited toward snakes in two populations of S. libidinosus living 320 km apart in Piaui, Brazil. As expected, capuchins have a fear reaction to dangerous snakes (usually venomous or constricting snakes), presenting mobbing behavior toward them. In contrast, they hunt and consume non-dangerous snakes without presenting the fear response. Our findings support the tested hypothesis that S. libidinosus are capable of differentiating snakes by level of danger: on the one hand they protect themselves from dangerous snakes, on the other hand they take opportunities to prey on non-dangerous snakes. Since capuchins and humans are both predators and prey of snakes, further studies of this complex relationship may shed light on the evolution of these traits in the human lineage.","[Falotico, Tiago; Verderane, Michele P.; Mendonca-Furtado, Olivia; Ottoni, Eduardo B.; Izar, Patricia] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Falotico, Tiago; Verderane, Michele P.] Neotrop Primates Res Grp, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Spagnoletti, Noemi; Visalberghi, Elisabetta] CNR Roma, Ist Sci & Tecnol Cogniz, Rome, Italy; [Falotico, Tiago] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Expt Psychol, Inst Psychol, Ave Prof Mello Moraes,1721 Bloco F,Sala 2, BR-18217130 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,"Falotico, T (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychol, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Falotico, T (corresponding author), Neotrop Primates Res Grp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Falotico, T (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Expt Psychol, Inst Psychol, Ave Prof Mello Moraes,1721 Bloco F,Sala 2, BR-18217130 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",tfalotico@gmail.com,"Ottoni, Eduardo Benedicto/E-4941-2012; Verderane, Michele/E-3078-2013; Izar, Patricia/C-3445-2012; Falótico, Tiago/I-1918-2012; Spagnoletti, Noemi/B-4811-2013; Mendonça-Furtado, Olívia/O-4853-2016","Ottoni, Eduardo Benedicto/0000-0003-1288-8345; Verderane, Michele/0000-0001-8467-8385; Izar, Patricia/0000-0001-6741-0731; Falótico, Tiago/0000-0002-0638-1989; Spagnoletti, Noemi/0000-0002-8285-5963; Mendonça-Furtado, Olívia/0000-0002-0643-5414","FUMDHAM; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2006/07187-5, 2006/07190-6, 2006/51578-9, 2008/52293-3, 2008/55684-3]; Universita La Sapienza di Roma; EU FP6 NEST Programme ANALOGY [029088]; Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione del CNR di Roma; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CapesCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)","T.F. and E.B.O. thank FUMDHAM and Niede Guidon for their support during the research in SCNP, and the field assistants Francisco Chico Reinaldo and George Reinaldo.

In this study, we assess the distance at which radio-collared wolves move away from an approaching human, also called the flight initiation distance (FID), and how FID is affected by wind speed and wind direction. We used silent VHF receivers and walked at normal pace towards radio-collared wolves. When approaching the wolves, we made no attempt to hide or walk in a less noisy manner. In the 34 experimental provocations, wolves moved away when the approaching human was between 17 and 310 m away. The mean FID was 106 m. FID was negatively correlated with wind speed.

Evolutionary theory predicts that costly antipredator behaviors will be selected against when predation risk diminishes. We examined antipredator behaviors in Aegean wall lizards, Podarcis erhardii, across an archipelago of land-bridge islands that vary in predator diversity and period of isolation. We examined two defenses, flight initiation distance and tail autotomy. Flight initiation distance generally decreased with declining predator diversity. All predator types had distinctive effects on flight initiation distance with mammals and birds having the largest estimated effects. Rates of autotomy observed in the field were highest on predator-free islands, yet laboratory-induced autotomy increased linearly with overall predator diversity. Against expectation from previous work, tail autotomy was not explained solely by the presence of vipers. Analyses of populations directly isolated from rich predator communities revealed that flight initiation distance decreased with increased duration of isolation in addition to the effects of current predator diversity, whereas tail autotomy could be explained simply by current predator diversity. Although selection against costly defenses should depend on time with reduced threats, different defenses may diminish along different trajectories even within the same predator-prey system.","[Brock, Kinsey M.; Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Dana Hall,440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bednekoff, Peter A.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA; [Pafilis, Panayiotis] Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Sect Human & Anim Physiol, Athens 15784, Greece",,"Brock, KM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Dana Hall,440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kbkinsey@umich.edu,,"Pafilis, Panayiotis/0000-0002-1832-4906; Foufopoulos, Johannes/0000-0002-8341-8271",University of Michigan School of Natural Resources Environment; University of Michigan Museum of Zoology; University of Michigan International InstituteUniversity of Michigan System; SNRE Envoys; University of Michigan Marching Band,"This study would not have been possible without financial support from the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources & Environment, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan International Institute, The SNRE Envoys, and the University of Michigan Marching Band.

Compensatory mechanisms may evolve to offset such costs, but evidence from natural systems is largely lacking. In songbirds, increased nest predation risk should favour reduced provisioning, but also young that fledge (leave their nest) at an earlier age. Both responses can result in fledglings with shorter wings, reduced mobility and decreased survival. Young may compensate for shorter wings developmentally by reallocating resources towards feather development or behaviourally by adjusting flight kinematics or habitat use. However, underfed young may lack the capacity to express these phenotypes due to insufficient resources or an inability to adjust allocation of resources. Using predation risk experiments and 29 years of observational field data, we test whether increased nest predation risk reduces flight performance and survival during the fledgling stage and explore potential mechanisms that might underlie these effects. We show that young from high-risk nests did not leave the nest earlier on average, but wing growth was slower likely due to observed reductions in parental feeding rates. Wings were shorter in high-risk nests when fledglings left the nest early. Yet, fledglings from high-risk nests showed improved flight performance for a given wing length such that flight performance at fledging did not differ between young from high-risk and low-risk nests. Young from high-risk nests may have offset the costs of shorter wings on flight performance by accelerating the emergence of flight feathers from their sheaths to reduce wing porosity, though evidence for this mechanism was mixed. Fledglings from high-risk nests also selected habitat with denser woody vegetation compared with young from low-risk nests. Together, these developmental and behavioural responses seem to mitigate the expected effects of increased nest predation risk on fledgling survival. Ultimately, our results show that offspring predation risk can affect parental provisioning and offspring morphology without major implications for performance and survival in subsequent life stages.

This is occurring throughout the urbanizing world as increases by generalist omnivores, like some crows and ravens (corvids) threaten other birds with increased rates of nest predation. The process of corvid responses and their actual effects on other species is only vaguely understood, so we quantified the population response of radio-tagged American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), common ravens (Corvus corax), and Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) to human settlements and campgrounds and examined their influence as nest predators on simulated marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) nests on Washington's Olympic Peninsula from 1995 to 2000. The behavior and demography of crows, ravens, and jays was correlated to varying degrees with proximity to human development. Crows and ravens had smaller home ranges and higher reproduction near human settlements and recreation. Annual survival of crows was positively associated with proximity to human development. Home range and reproduction of Steller's jays was independent of proximity to human settlements and campgrounds. Local density of crows increased because home ranges of neighboring breeding pairs overlapped extensively (6x more than ravens and 3x more than Steller's jays) and breeders far from anthropogenic foods traveled 10s of kilometers to access them. Corvids accounted for 32.5% of the predation events (n = 837) we documented on artificial murrelet nests. Small corvids (jays) were common nest predators across our study area but their contribution as predators did not vary with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. in contrast, large corvids (crows and ravens) were rare nest predators across our study area but their contribution varied greatly with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. Managers seeking to reduce the risk of nest predation need to consider the varied impacts and variable behavioral and population responses of potential nest predators. In our situation, removing large corvids may do little to reduce overall rates of nest predation because of the diverse predator assemblage, but reducing anthropogenic food in the landscape may be effective.

However, rigorous assessment of the test-retest reliability of these tests is relatively uncommon. The importance of such assessment is illustrated by this study of the responses of Japanese quail during four tests of fearfulness. Forty-six adult quail were subjected to an emergence test, novel object test, novel food test, and predator surprise test on two consecutive days to assess test-retest reliability. Multiple behavioural measures were made during each test. One test was performed per day. There were discrepancies in the reliabilities of the various measures made within each test. For example, latency to extend the head into the emergence arena was poorly correlated on two consecutive days (partial r =.19, n = 46, P =.29), but the number of times the birds extended their heads into the arena was much more reliable (partial r =.73, n = 46, P <.001). Similarly, latency to try a novel food was a relatively unreliable measure (partial r =.47, n = 46, P <.01) as compared to the amount of novel food eaten (partial r =.81, n = 46, P <.001). This study also revealed the value of using a partial correlation coefficient when examining the reliability of animal fearfulness, rather than the more commonly reported Pearson's coefficient. Factors such as sex and pen location inflated the latter but were partialled out by the former, leading to lower coefficients on most measures (e.g. for latency to orient towards a novel object on two consecutive days, partial r =.19, Pearson's r =.52). Finally, the statistically significant but small correlation coefficients for many measures in this study and other published fear studies, many less than .4, indicate that some common behavioural measures of fearfulness are not always reliable.

We assessed the role of five pathways through which various correlates potentially influence human responses toward wild animals, namely, value orientation, social interactions (i.e. social cohesion and support), dependence on resources such as agriculture and livestock, risk perception and nature of interaction with the wild animal. We specifically evaluated their influence on people's responses toward two large carnivores, the snow leopardPanthera unciaand the wolfCanis lupusin an agropastoral landscape in the Indian Trans-Himalaya. We found that the nature of the interaction (location, impact and length of time since an encounter or depredation event), and risk perception (cognitive and affective evaluation of the threat posed by the animal) had a significant influence on attitudes and behaviors toward the snow leopard. For wolves, risk perception and social interactions (the relationship of people with local institutions and inter-community dynamics) were significant. Our findings underscore the importance of interventions that reduce people's threat perceptions from carnivores, improve their connection with nature and strengthen the conservation capacity of local institutions especially in the context of wolves.","[Bhatia, S.; Suryawanshi, K.; Mishra, C.] Nat Conservat Fdn, 1311 Amritha,12th Main,Vijayanagar 1st Stage, Mysore 570017, Karnataka, India; [Bhatia, S.; Suryawanshi, K.; Mishra, C.] Snow Leopard Trust, Seattle, WA USA; [Bhatia, S.] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal, India; [Redpath, S.

The goal of this study was to assess the effects of recreational activities on Iberian frogs Rana iberica, an endemic and vulnerable species of the Iberian Peninsula, through observation and manipulative approaches. At the population level, we found that frog abundance decreased with the proximity to recreational areas. At the individual level, the behavioral responses of frogs to repeated disturbance events increased the time to resume pre-disturbance activities, but did not affect significantly flight initiation distances. We simulated different levels of human visitation to the stream banks, and found 80% and 100% decrease in stream bank use with a fivefold and a 12-fold increase in direct disturbance rate, respectively. Recreational activities are negatively affecting Iberian frogs through a loss in the spatial and temporal availability of resources. To reduce the level of local disturbance to this species, we recommend setting up buffer areas >2.5 m from the streams or reducing visitor rates to fewer than 5 visits per hour (either groups or individuals). The role of direct human disturbance should be considered further as a potential factor affecting local amphibian declines. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Behavioural response of animals to tourists is often studied to ensure informed management decision-making, a task frequently supported by flight distance analysis. In this context, guanaco (Lama guanicoe) response to tourists was studied in a protected area using two complementary methods: flight distance and sighting frequency analyses. Flight response analyses show that guanacos develop a considerable tolerance to vehicles and pedestrians in tourist areas, a reaction that extends approximately 500 m around visited areas. Such analyses thus point to (i) few areas being underused as a consequence of human presence and (ii) a low risk of tame animals being poached outside the park, all potentially leading to the conclusion that tourist visits are sustainable. However, guanaco sighting frequencies during 107 fieldwork days along 3 years show a significant reduction in sightings on days with higher Park visitor numbers. Moreover we present a formal procedure for the definition of a threshold for this to happen (247 visitors/day in our case). This suggests the potential risk of negative effects on guanaco population and a lower probability of guanaco sightings if Park visitor numbers rise beyond current figures. Results allow to conclude that assessment of human disturbance to flagship species in protected areas requires further methods in addition to flight distance.","[Malo, Juan E.; Acebes, Pablo; Traba, Juan] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Group TEG, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",,"Malo, JE (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, Terr Ecol Group TEG, C-C Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",je.malo@uam.es,"Acebes, Pablo/L-6444-2014; Malo, Juan E/K-8305-2014; Traba, Juan/D-9191-2012; Arrazola, Juan Esteban Malo/Q-4819-2019","Malo, Juan E/0000-0002-6033-5035; Traba, Juan/0000-0001-6326-8942; Arrazola, Juan Esteban Malo/0000-0002-6033-5035; Acebes Vives, Pablo/0000-0003-1880-7841",BBVA FoundationBBVA Foundation; Fondo Social Europeo-Comunidad de Madrid [S-2009/AMB/1783],This research was funded by a Biological Conservation project from the BBVA Foundation (INTERMARG Project).

While human threat to wildlife is considered to be complex (nonlethal recreations and lethal hunting activities). To date, there has been few studies that focus on nest defense behavior of animals to human disturbance. In this study, we tested whether the behavioral response of Oriental reed warblers Acrocephalus orientalis against a human intruder are similar to other nest intruders. We used dummies of common cuckoo Cuculus canorus (the parasite), Eurasian sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus (the predator), Oriental turtle dove Streptopelia orientalis (the neutral control), also a human intruder to induce the nest defense behaviors and alarm calls of Oriental reed warblers. Our results showed that Oriental reed warblers performed less intense nest defense behavior and uttered the least number of calls and shortest duration of calls to a human intruder than those to other nest intruders, suggesting that human pose a low threat level to warblers. Warblers produced different number and duration of alarm calls against the cuckoos, sparrowhawks and doves, even though they performed similar behavioral responses to the three types of avian intruder, indicating that they could distinguish the three types of avian intruders. The present study provided experimental evidence for the different behavioral responses between human disturbance and other types of intruders and suggested that the less intense behavioral response to human disturbance may be the result of habituation.

The relative importance of these goals in driving carnivore movement likely changes across temporal scales, but our understanding of these dynamics remains limited. Here we quantified how drivers of movement and habitat selection changed with temporal grain for two large carnivore species living in human-dominated landscapes, providing insights into commonalities in carnivore movement strategies across regions. We used high-resolution GPS collar data and integrated step selection analyses to model movement and habitat selection for African lions Panthera leo in Laikipia, Kenya and pumas Puma concolor in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California across eight temporal grains, ranging from 5 min to 12 hr. Analyses considered landscape covariates that are related to energetics, resource acquisition and anthropogenic risk. For both species, topographic slope, which strongly influences energetic expenditure, drove habitat selection and movement patterns over fine temporal grains but was less important at longer temporal grains. In contrast, avoiding anthropogenic risk during the day, when risk was highest, was consistently important across grains, but the degree to which carnivores relaxed this avoidance at night was strongest for longer term movements. Lions and pumas modified their movement behaviour differently in response to anthropogenic features: lions sped up while near humans at fine temporal grains, while pumas slowed down in more developed areas at coarse temporal grains. Finally, pumas experienced a trade-off between energetically efficient movement and avoiding anthropogenic risk. Temporal grain is an important methodological consideration in habitat selection analyses, as drivers of both movement and habitat selection changed across temporal grain. Additionally, grain-dependent patterns can reflect meaningful behavioural processes, including how fitness-relevant goals influence behaviour over different periods of time. In applying multi-scale analysis to fine-resolution data, we showed that two large carnivore species in very different human-dominated landscapes balanced competing energetic and safety demands in largely similar ways. These commonalities suggest general strategies of landscape use across large carnivore species.","[Nisi, Anna C.; Suraci, Justin P.; Ranc, Nathan; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Conservat Sci Partners, Truckee, CA USA; [Frank, Laurence G.; Ekwanga, Steven] Mpala Res Ctr, Living Lions, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Frank, Laurence G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne] Univ Oxford, Zool Dept, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon, Oxon, England; [Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne] Lion Landscapes, Teignmouth, England; [Williams, Terrie M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Nisi, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",nisianna@gmail.com,,"Frank, Laurence/0000-0003-3091-6768; Oriol-Cotterill, Alayne/0000-0003-0049-7988; Nisi, Anna/0000-0003-0286-3187; Williams, Terrie/0000-0001-8170-009X; Ranc, Nathan/0000-0002-3167-2251","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0963022, 1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 0963022 and 1255913; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation",,64,2,2,13,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Of particular interest and importance are the effects of contaminants on inter-species interactions such as competition and predator-prey relationships. The objective of this study was to determine whether environmentally relevant concentrations of the commonly used insecticide, malathion, would alter predator avoidance behavior in a freshwater gastropod that could translate to increased predation risk. We exposed adult Physa pomilia snails to 0, 0.25, or 1.0 mg/L malathion for 2, 24, or 48 h and evaluated predator avoidance using a behavioral assay in which snails were exposed to cues from predatory crayfish. We found a significant reduction in predator avoidance in snails exposed to both concentrations of malathion after 48 h of exposure. To evaluate whether observed effects of malathion on predator avoidance actually increased susceptibility of snails to predators, we conducted a predator challenge experiment. Snails exposed to 0.25 mg/L malathion for 48 h were significantly more susceptible to predation. That increased predation risk was evident 48 h after initial malathion exposures is a unique result because most studies have evaluated behavioral responses soon after (< 12 h) initiation of pesticide exposure. The extent to which the observed interactions affect natural populations, and the mechanisms through which they are mediated are largely unexplored. However, our study is the first to show that a commonly used insecticide decreases predator avoidance and may actually increase predation susceptibility in gastropods at concentrations several orders of magnitude below acute toxicity levels.","[Salice, Christopher J.; Kimberly, David A.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Environm Toxicol, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",,"Salice, CJ (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Environm Toxicol, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, POB 41163, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",chris.salice@ttu.edu,,,Texas Tech University; Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH),The authors would like to thank Texas Tech University and the Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH) for support to DAK.

If individuals are engaged in another activity that might affect fitness, trade-offs between the fitness benefits of flight and the other activity should determine the nearest distance of approach by a predator. In a comparative analysis of birds, flight distance represented a reliable measure of risk of predation by the sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus that increased with decreasing flight distance across species. To test the hypothesis that singing males adjusted their risk taking to the costs and benefits of early flight, we compared the flight distance of singing and nonsinging birds to an approaching human observing with a binocular. Singing birds on average fled at a greater distance than nonsinging birds, implying that singing birds took small risks. We used a standardized measure of difference in flight distance between singing and nonsinging individuals to investigate factors affecting interspecific variation in risk taking. Species that used more exposed song posts (sites used for singing) took smaller risks than species with less exposed song posts. Species that suffered from higher levels of parasitism as reflected by the prevalence of Plasmodium, but not by 3 other genera of blood parasites, took greater risks during singing compared with nonsinging activities. Likewise, species with high circulating levels of natural antibodies, and hence a history of natural selection caused by bacteria took relatively greater risks during singing than species with few natural antibodies. These findings suggest that risks taken by singing birds have been molded by natural and sexual selection, and that risk taking represents a compromise between the costs and benefits of flight from a potential predator.","[Moller, A.

Risk-taking behaviour can be hypothesised to depend on escape ability, which is difficult to study in the wild. In this field study, we investigated whether escape ability (i) is a consistent individual-specific characteristic and (ii) can explain between-individual variation in risktaking behaviour in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We estimated escape ability by the time that was needed to capture individuals by hand in an outdoor aviary during both the courtship and the nestling feeding phases. We estimated risk-taking by human-induced flight initiation distance (FID) and parental nest-defence behaviour. We also measured variables that reflect individual quality and condition to assess how these affect escape ability. Time to capture was weakly repeatable in the within-and between-season contexts, but was considerably repeatable within a day. We found that time to capture decreased between courtship and nestling feeding phases, probably due to parallel changes in body condition (as shown by the systematic decline of individual body mass between phases correlating with within-individual changes in time to capture). Overall, time to capture was not significantly related to risk-taking behaviour, but we found a negative correlation between time to capture and FID in yearlings. In conclusion, escape ability in flycatchers seems to be a condition-dependent plastic trait, and it has the potential to affect immediate risk-taking decisions.","[Jablonszky, Monika; Szasz, Eszter; Marko, Gabor; Torok, Janos; Herczeg, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Behav Ecol Grp, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Pazmany P Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Marko, Gabor] Szent Istvan Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Menesi Ut 44, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary; [Marko, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, MTA ELTE MTM Ecol Res Grp, Inst Biol, Pazmany P Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, C Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain",,"Jablonszky, M (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Behav Ecol Grp, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Pazmany P Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",jablonszky.monika@gmail.com,"Torok, Janos/C-6144-2008; Marko, Gabor/AAX-1166-2020; Zseb?k, Sándor/H-4768-2015; Herczeg, Gábor/AAF-9978-2020; Szasz, Eszter/AAH-8819-2019; Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015; Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021","Torok, Janos/0000-0002-4799-5522; Marko, Gabor/0000-0003-1351-4070; Zseb?k, Sándor/0000-0003-4463-4753; Szasz, Eszter/0000-0002-9810-2085; Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183; Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation OfficeNational Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary [K-75618, K-101611, K-105517, K-115970]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness in SpainSpanish Government [CGL2015-70639-P]; Pilis Park Forestry [KTVF 509-4/2012, PE/KTF/11978-5/2015, PE/KTF/11978-10/2015]","We thank the Behavioural Ecology Group of Eotvos Lorand University, especially Lilla Barabas, Nora Boross, Gergely Hegyi, Dora Kotel, Kata Krenhardt, Miklos Laczi, Gergely Nagy, Balazs Rosivall, Eszter Szollosi, Eva Vaskuti and Sandor Zsebok for their help in the fieldwork.

For example, reduction of arboreal perches through clear-cutting in managed Florida scrub may alter lizard behavior, and predation risk, which in turn, may alter lizard abundance. We ask whether risk aversion behavior is habitat-specific, and potentially reflects predation intensity. Four predator avoidance traits were quantified in S. woodi from longleaf pine and Florida scrub habitats. We also asked if habitat type was linked to phenotypic traits (e.g., body size, hind limb length) that might alter risk aversion behaviors. Lizards in longleaf pine had greater detection distance and flight distance and were farther from refuges, indicating higher risk aversion compared to populations in Florida scrub. Given this, males may be more sensitive to predation than females, especially during the breeding season. Males were encountered more often than females in both habitats, and detected from a greater distance in longleaf, but not Florida scrub. Population density may affect lizard behavior, yet we found no difference in population density between the habitats for stands sampled, nor any relationship of population density to risk aversion behaviors. These results demonstrate that management activities, which alter vegetation and substrate characteristics, also alter aspects of lizard behavior that subsequently may influence predation pressure among sub-populations. Human activity has fundamentally changed most habitats on Earth such that management is now required for conservation of native species and preservation of resources. We hypothesized that differential management between longleaf pine and Florida scrub habitats might alter risk aversion behavior. Our results show that lizards use different refuges between habitat types, and that lizards are more weary in the more open habitat (longleaf pine). Frequent prescribed fire in longleaf pine maintains a suitable thermal microclimate and access to key refuges (mature trees), whereas clear-cutting of Florida scrub yields more shrubs, no vertical perches, and higher temperatures. Thus, habitat management fundamentally alters predator avoidance behavior, which in turn is linked to predation intensity and the probability of population persistence. This study highlights the challenge of designing management plans that are beneficial to all constituent species.","[McBrayer, Lance D.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, POB 8042-1, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Parker, Seth E.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, 119 Foster Hall, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,"McBrayer, LD (corresponding author), Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, POB 8042-1, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",lancemcbrayer@georgiasouthern.edu,,,Graduate Student Professional Development grant from the College of Graduate Studies; Department of Biology at Georgia Southern University,"Funding for this research was provided by a Graduate Student Professional Development grant from the College of Graduate Studies, and the Department of Biology at Georgia Southern University.",,51,1,1,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Tamarins then viewed a living snake during playback of mobbing calls. In posttests, tamarins did not mob the snake. We then eliminated the pretest to avoid potential habituation and placed a stillborn tamarin with the snake in an attempt to heighten arousal. In posttests, tamarins again did not mob the snake, although they did increase their rates of calls, indicating mild arousal. Overall, none of 8 groups of cotton-top tamarins learned to mob a predator. Potential reasons for failure include conditioning multiple subjects at once and the lack of an experienced demonstrator.

There was a positive relationship between the number of seals hauled out and the distance from shore for eight known haul-out sites. The hypothesis that harbor seals increasingly hauled out farther offshore to reduce predation risk was tested experimentally by measuring their response to a model of a potential terrestrial predator in comparison to a control object, and to disturbance by a human at one of the study sites. Harbor seals abandoned the haul-out in the presence of the predator model, but showed little response to the controls, suggesting they possess a threat image for terrestrial predators and avoid hauling out when it is perceived.

Sleep is vital for optimal physical and cognitive performance, yet humans sleep the least of all primates. In addition, consolidated and continuous monophasic sleep is evidently advantageous, yet emerging comparative data sets from small-scale societies show that the phasing of the human pattern of sleep-wake activity is highly variable and characterized by significant nighttime activity. To reconcile these phenomena, the social sleep hypothesis proposes that extant traits of human sleep emerged because of social and technological niche construction. Specifically, sleep sites function as a type of social shelter by way of an extended structure of social groups that increases fitness. Short, high-quality, and flexibly timed sleep likely originated as a response to predation risks while sleeping terrestrially. This practice may have been a necessary preadaptation formigration out of Africa and for survival in ecological niches that penetrate latitudes with the greatest seasonal variation in light and temperature on the planet.","[Samson, David R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, Mississauga, ON L5L IC6, Canada",,"Samson, DR (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Anthropol, Mississauga, ON L5L IC6, Canada.",david.samson@utoronto.ca,,,,,,100,0,0,11,11,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0084-6570,1545-4290,978-0-8243-1950-2,ANNU REV ANTHROPOL,Annu.

We examined predator-naive minnows that had the opportunity to learn about predators from experienced models that were raised in either a low- or high-risk environment. There were striking differences in behaviour among models; high-risk models showed a weaker response to the predator cue and became neophobic in response to the control cue (a novel odour, NO). Observers that were previously paired with low-risk models acquired a strong antipredator response only to the predator cue. However, observers that interacted with high-risk models, displayed a much weaker response to the predator odour and a weak neophobic response to the NO. This is the first study reporting such different outcomes of social learning under different environmental conditions, and suggests high-risk environments promote the cultural transmission of neophobia more so than social learning. If such a transfer can be considered similar to secondary traumatization in humans, culturally transmitted neophobia in minnows may provide a good model system for understanding more about the social ecology of fear disorders.","[Crane, Adam L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Mathiron, Anthony G.

Nestling birds communicate with their parents using loud begging calls that convey their need for food, but that also attract predators to the nest. Parents can reduce this vulnerability by using alarm calls to silence begging nestlings. Noise could, however, mask alarm calls and increase predation risk, unless parents can adjust their calls to circumvent the noise. Here, we determined whether the response of nestling tree swallows to parental alarm calls is altered in the presence of noise, and whether parents adjust alarm calls in noise to improve call transmission. We found that, in noisy conditions, nestlings continued calling and failed to crouch in the nest in response to parental alarm calls, in contrast to their behaviour in quiet conditions. None of the call features that we measured varied in relation to ambient noise levels at the nest.

Little research has been conducted on the behavioral responses of wildlife when encountering these novel structures over time. We used the installation of new wildlife road crossing structures built along a 6000-year old migration route to evaluate behavioral responses of long-distance migrators to the structures. We collected behavioral data during and after construction in order to evaluate individuals' immediate responses to these structures and to investigate how they changed over time using generalized linear mixed-effects models and generalized additive models fit by maximum likelihood. Pronghorn acclimated to the crossing structures and the frequency in which they successfully crossed them increased over time. The probability of pronghorn successfully crossing a structure was not influenced by human presence. Pronghorn spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors after construction. Pronghorn also spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors at relatively further distances from a structure and lead individuals spent more time in sustained vigilance behaviors than non-lead individuals. We did not detect any significant factors associated with stress behaviors. Pronghorn still demonstrated high sustained vigilance when approaching the structures after 20 months post construction, despite an increase in crossing success. While we found evidence of risk-avoidance behaviors in pronghorn at crossing structures, this work provides evidence that pronghorn gradually acclimated to wildlife crossing structures built in a historical migration corridor in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. We recommend using task completion chronology (rather than project completion dates) to install wildlife mitigation and we recommend using wildlife friendly fencing when fences are required for multiple use (e.g., cattle) at crossing structure entrances.

Recently rodent and human threat responses have been compared using 'predators' that can be real (e.g. a tarantula), robot, virtual, or symbolic (with the last three rendered predatory by the use of shock). 'Quick and dirty' survival circuits in the periaqueductal grey, hypothalamus, and amygdala control external RA behaviour.

The safe-habitat hypothesis explains this pattern through a decrease in the abundance of native predators, which reduces predation risk in urban habitats. However, this hypothesis does not consider the potential negative effects of human-associated disturbance (e.g., pedestrians, dogs, cats). Our goal was to assess the degree of perceived predation risk in house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) through field studies and semi-natural experiments in areas with different levels of urbanization using multiple indicators of risk (flock size, flight initiation distance, vigilance, and foraging behavior). Field studies showed that house finches in more urbanized habitats had a greater tendency to flock with an increase in population density and flushed at larger distances than in less urbanized habitats. In the semi-natural experiment, we found that individuals spent a greater proportion of time in the refuge patch and increased the instantaneous pecking rate in the more urbanized habitat with pedestrians probably to compensate for the lower amount of foraging time. Vigilance parameters were influenced in different ways depending on habitat type and distance to flock mates. Our results suggest that house finches may perceive highly urbanized habitats as more dangerous, despite the lower number of native predators. This could be due to the presence of human activities, which could increase risk or modify the ability to detect predators. House finches seem to adapt to the urban environment through different behavioral strategies that minimize risk.","[Valcarcel, Anna; Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",,"Fernandez-Juricic, E (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",efernand@csulb.edu,,,,,,68,64,66,4,91,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We examined patch choice in a non-risky environment by presenting starved and non-starved P. polycephalum amoebas with a choice between two shaded food patches (one high quality, one low quality). We next examined patch choice in the presence of a conflict between foraging risk (light exposure) and food quality by presenting amoebas with a choice between a shaded, low quality patch, and a light-exposed, high-quality patch. When both patches were shaded, 100% of amoebas selected the higher quality food patch, irrespective of food-quality differences or the individual's energetic status. When light exposure and food quality conflicted, amoebas selected the patch with the higher food quality when the quality difference between the patches was high. When the quality difference between patches was small, amoebas selected the shaded, lower quality patch.","[Latty, Tanya; Beekman, Madeleine] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Behav & Genet Social Insects Lab, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,"Latty, T (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Behav & Genet Social Insects Lab, A12 Sci Rd, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",tlatty@mail.usyd.edu.au,"Beekman, Madeleine/A-3983-2011; Beekman, Madeleine/AAF-8574-2019","Beekman, Madeleine/0000-0002-9040-3756; Beekman, Madeleine/0000-0002-9040-3756",Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,We thank members of the Behavior and Genetics of Social Insects Lab and the two anonymous referees for. helpful suggestions.

Recently, we have seen considerable attention paid to increasing global CO2 emissions which lead to ocean acidification (OA), Other stressors, such as changing levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), also impact biodiversity but have received much less attention in the recent past. Here we examine fundamental questions about temporal aspects of risk assessment by coral reef damselfish and provide critical insights into how OA and UVR influence this assessment. Chemical cues released during a predator attack provide a rich source of information that other prey animals use to mediate their risk of predation and are the basis of the majority of trait-mediated indirect interactions in aquatic communities. However, we have surprisingly limited information about temporal aspects of risk assessment because we lack knowledge about how long chemical cues persist after they are released into the environment. Here, we showed that under ambient CO2 conditions (similar to 385 mu atm), alarm cues of ambon damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis) did not degrade within 30 min in the absence of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), but were degraded within 15 min when the CO2 was increased to similar to 905 mu atm. In experiments that used filters to eliminate UVR, we found minimal degradation of alarm cues within 30 min, whereas under ambient UVR conditions, alarm cues were completely degraded within 15 min. Moreover, in the presence of both UVR and elevated CO2, alarm cues were broken down within 5 min. Our results highlight that alarm cues degrade surprisingly quickly under natural conditions and that anthropogenic changes have the potential to dramatically change rates of cue degradation in the wild. This has considerable implications for risk assessment and consequently the importance of trait-mediated indirect interactions in coral-reef communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the specific effects of human activities on ranging behavior can improve conservation management of wildlife populations in human-dominated landscapes. This study evaluated the effects of forest use by humans on the spatial distribution of mammal species with different behavioral adaptations, using sympatric western lowland gorilla and central chimpanzee as focal species. We collected data on great ape nest locations, ecological and physical variables (habitat distribution, permanent rivers, and topographic data), and anthropogenic variables (distance to trails, villages, and a permanent research site). Here, we show that anthropogenic variables are important predictors of the distribution of wild animals. In the resource model, the distribution of gorilla nests was predicted by nesting habitat distribution, while chimpanzee nests were predicted first by elevation followed by nesting habitat distribution. In the anthropogenic model, the major predictors of gorilla nesting changed to human features, while the major predictors of chimpanzee nesting remained elevation and the availability of their preferred nesting habitats. Animal behavioral traits (body size, terrestrial/arboreal, level of specialization/generalization, and competitive inferiority/superiority) may influence the response of mammals to human activities. Our results suggest that chimpanzees may survive in human-encroached areas whenever the availability of their nesting habitat and preferred fruits can support their population, while a certain level of human activities may threaten gorillas. Consequently, the survival of gorillas in human-dominated landscapes is more at risk than that of chimpanzees. Replicating our research in other sites should permit a systematic evaluation of the influence of human activity on the distribution of mammal populations. As wild animals are increasingly exposed to human disturbance, understanding the resulting consequences of shifting species distributions due to human disturbance on animal population abundance and their long-term survival will be of growing conservation importance.","[Tedonzong, Luc Roscelin Dongmo; Willie, Jacob; Makengveu, Sandra Tewamba; Tagg, Nikki] RZSA, PGS, CRC, Antwerp, Belgium; [Tedonzong, Luc Roscelin Dongmo; Willie, Jacob; Lens, Luc] Ghent Univ UGent, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Unit TEREC, Ghent, Belgium; [Makengveu, Sandra Tewamba] Univ Dschang, Dept Forestry, Fac Agron & Agr Sci FASA, Dschang, Cameroon; [Tedonzong, Luc Roscelin Dongmo] WCF, Monrovia, Liberia",,"Tedonzong, LRD (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, KL Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",tedonzongluc@gmail.com,"Tedonzong, Luc/L-6290-2018","Tedonzong, Luc/0000-0002-9347-8630",,,,128,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here we use longitudinal calcium transient recordings of dPAG ensembles in freely moving mice to show that this region uses shared patterns of activity to represent distance to an innate threat (a live predator) and a conditioned threat (a shock grid). We also show that dPAG neural activity can predict diverse defensive behaviors. These data indicate the dPAG uses conserved population-level activity patterns to encode and coordinate defensive behaviors during exposure to both innate The brainstem dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) has been widely recognized as being a vital node orchestrating the responses to innate threats. Intriguingly, recent evidence also shows that the dPAG mediates defensive responses to fear conditioned contexts. However, it is unknown whether the dPAG displays independent or shared patterns of activation during exposure to innate and conditioned threats. It is also unclear how dPAG ensembles encode and predict diverse defensive behaviors. To address this question, we used miniaturized microscopes to obtain recordings of the same dPAG ensembles during exposure to a live predator and a fear conditioned context in male mice. dPAG ensembles encoded not only distance to threat, but also relevant features, such as predator speed and angular offset between mouse and threat. Furthermore, dPAG cells accurately encoded numerous defensive behaviors, including freezing, stretch-attend postures, and escape. Encoding of behaviors and of distance to threat occurred independently in dPAG cells. dPAG cells also displayed a shared representation to encode these behaviors and distance to threat across innate and conditioned threats. Last, we also show that escape could be predicted by dPAG activity several seconds in advance. Thus, dPAG activity dynamically tracks key kinematic and behavioral variables during exposure to threats, and exhibits similar patterns of activation during defensive behaviors elicited by innate or conditioned threats. These data indicate that a common pathway may be recruited by the dPAG during exposure to a wide variety of threat modalities.","[Reis, Fernando M. C.

Demography and conservation status of many wild organisms are increasingly shaped by interactions with humans. This is particularly the case for large, wide-ranging carnivores. 2. Using 206 mortality records (1999-2012) of lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we calculated mortality rates for each source of anthropogenic mortality, modelled risk of anthropogenic mortality across the landscape accounting for time lions spent in different parts of the landscape, and assessed whether subsets of the population were more at risk. 3. Anthropogenic activities caused 88% of male and 67% of female mortalities; male mortality being dominated by trophy hunting while the sources for female mortality were more varied (bycatch snaring, retaliatory killing, hunting). 4. Landscapes of anthropogenic mortality risk revealed that communal subsistence farming areas, characterized by high risk (due to retaliatory killing) but avoided by lions, are population sinks. Trophy hunting areas and areas within protected areas bordering communal farmland, where bushmeat snaring is prevalent, form 'ecological traps' (or 'attractive sinks'). 5. Lions avoided risky areas, suggesting they may make behavioural decisions based on perceptions of risk. Experienced adults used risky areas less and incorporated lower proportions of them in their home ranges than young individuals, suggesting that the latter may either be naive or forced into peripheral habitats. 6. Synthesis and applications. This paper contributes to an understanding of how large carnivore populations are affected by anthropogenic mortality across the conservation landscape. This is critical to designing focussed, appropriate and cost-effective conservation management strategies. Agricultural areas are intuitively identified by conservationists as being risky for carnivores due to retaliatory killing, with threats largely mitigated against by improving livestock protection. However, parts of protected areas may also form less easily identified 'attractive sinks' for carnivores. In particular, trophy hunting areas adjacent to national parks need careful management to avoid damaging effects of overhunting. Law enforcement is needed to reduce the effects of bushmeat poaching on predators and other wildlife in protected areas. To be most effective, resource-limited antipoaching activities should prioritize wildlife-rich areas close to human settlement as these tend to be hot spots for bushmeat poaching.","[Loveridge, Andrew J.; Valeix, Marion; Elliot, Nicholas B.; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Oxford OX13 5QL, England; [Valeix, Marion] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5558, 1 Bat Gregor Mendel,43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",,"Loveridge, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Oxford OX13 5QL, England.",andrew.loveridge@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010",,"Darwin Initiative for Biodiversity Grants [162-09-015, EIDPO002]; Mitsubishi Fund for Europe and Africa; SATIB Trust; Eppley Foundation; Panthera Foundation; Robertson Foundation; Recanati-Kaplan Foundation","We thank the Director of ZPWMA for permission to undertake this research and the assistance of ZPWMA and Hwange Lion Project field staff for data collection.

In the current study we exposed zebrafish from two genetically distinct strains (WIK and TU) to a computer animated image of a natural predator of this species, the Indian leaf fish. We measured the subjects' behavioural responses in the presence of different acute doses of alcohol (0.00, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00% vol/vol) using an observation based event-recording method. We found fish of both strains to exhibit an atypical predator inspection response during the presentation of the animated predator image coupled with a classical fear response, increased jumping frequency. We found numerous alcohol induced behavioural changes and more importantly also revealed alcohol induced strain dependent changes as well, including different dose-response trajectories for WIK vs. TU in predator inspection response, general swimming activity, location of swimming (top vs. bottom half of the tank) and freezing. The results suggest that zebrafish of the TU strain may be more tolerant at least to lower doses of alcohol as compared to WIK. The characterization of strain differences in zebrafish will aid the identification of possible molecular mechanisms involved in alcohol's actions in the vertebrate brain. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, relatively few studies have examined the physiological or behavioural mechanisms whereby disturbance influences reproductive fitness, or the extent to which the costs of disturbance may be reduced through habituation. We compared the behavioural responses, egg temperatures and reproductive success of shore-nesting white-fronted plovers Charadrius marginatus to disturbance at two breeding sites experiencing low versus high human recreational activity, respectively. Daytime nest attentiveness decreased with increasing experimental disturbance at both sites, but this relationship differed between sites; for any given level of disturbance, incubating birds at the more disturbed site had greater nest attentiveness. They achieved this through habituation, allowing a closer human approach before leaving the nest, and returning to the nest faster after a disturbance event. Despite lower average daytime nest attentiveness at the more disturbed site, incubation temperatures did not differ significantly between sites. Nest mortality, mostly by natural mammalian and corvid predators, was significantly lower at the site experiencing high recreational activity. However, chick mortality was significantly greater at the more disturbed site, most likely because of predation by domestic dogs. Chick mortality may have been increased by the habitation of chicks, whose escape responses were much reduced at the more disturbed site. Nonetheless, annual fecundity was substantially higher at the more disturbed site, showing that the overall reproductive fitness of wild birds is not always compromised by human disturbance and urbanization.","Univ Cape Town, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",,"Lloyd, P (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",Penn.Lloyd@uct.ac.za,,,,,,48,63,73,3,76,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-9430,,,ANIM CONSERV,Anim.

We investigated the response of feeding three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exposed to a sudden appearance of an avian predator (the silhouette of common tern, Sterna hirundo), under clear and turbid water conditions. As stickleback use social cues to aid in predator avoidance, we also tested whether turbidity affected social information use by manipulating group size. We found that in turbid water, a smaller proportion of fish would escape from the feeding area, that the distance escaped was shorter and that a smaller proportion of fish fled into shelter. Larger group size was associated with longer escape distance and greater shelter use. However, there was no effect of group size on the proportion of fish that escaped the arena. The effect of group size was similar for turbid and clear water. Our finding that the fish showed a weaker antipredator response suggests that turbidity impedes their risk assessment capability. However, the sticklebacks were still able to benefit of the social facilitation provided by being in a group. This suggests that algal turbidity has detrimental effects on the ability of sticklebacks to assess predation risk from avian predators in shallow water. An implication is that in shallow water fish may be more vulnerable to avian predation under turbid conditions.","[Sohel, Shakwat; Lindstrom, Kai] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland",,"Lindstrom, K (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland.",kai.lindstrom@abo.fi,"Lindström, Kai/ABG-4353-2020; Lindström, Kai/B-5479-2008","Lindström, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538; Lindström, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538",Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Oskar Oflunds Stiftelse,We are grateful to Tvarminne Zoological Station for providing excellent facilities.

It enhances their survival and probability of future reproduction. At the same time, animals cannot be maximally defended because imperatives of defense usually trade-off with behaviors required for sexual reproduction like display of dominance and production of sexual pheromones. Here, we approach this trade-off through the lens of arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons within the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) of mice. This neuronal population is known to be involved in sexual behaviors like approach to sexually salient cues. We show that chemogenetic partial ablation of this neuronal population increases aversion to predator odors. Moreover, overexpression of AVP within this population is sufficient to reduce aversion to predator odors. The loss of fear of the predator odor occurs in parallel with increased recruitment of AVP neurons within the MePD. These observations suggest that AVP neurons in the medial aspect of the extended amygdala are a proximate locus for the reduction in innate fear during life stages dominated by reproductive efforts.","[Tong, Wen Han; Abdulai-Saiku, Samira; Vyas, Ajai] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 60 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637551, Singapore",,"Vyas, A (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Biol Sci, 60 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637551, Singapore.",avyas@ntu.edu.sg,"Abdulai-Saiku, Samira/AFN-4249-2022; Vyas, Ajai/A-2223-2011","Abdulai-Saiku, Samira/0000-0003-3772-4646; Vyas, Ajai/0000-0002-2592-6796; Tong, Wen Han/0000-0001-7726-9604",Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP0062/2018],This work was financially supported by the Human Frontier Science Program (grant RGP0062/2018).,,82,7,7,0,4,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0028-3835,1423-0194,,NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY,Neuroendocrinology,JUN,2021,111,6,,,,,505,520,,10.1159/000508862,,,16,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Endocrinology & Metabolism; Neurosciences & Neurology,SP2XF,WOS:000659536700001,32447337,Bronze,,,2022-04-19,

Prey risk perception is constantly updated via collection of personal and social information about predators. Better understanding of the links between information availability, its use, and prey species' perception of risk will aid in explaining how animals adapt to predation. The goal of this study was to determine the environmental and social cues-available to prey via personal and social information, respectively-that influence wild squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) reactivity to potential predators, treated here as a proxy for risk perception. We followed squirrel monkey troops for 3 years in Suriname, SouthAmerica, and accounted for environmental and social variables associated with potential predator encounters. We utilized logistic regression models applied to a robust and long-term data set to reveal relationships among factors affecting squirrel monkey anti-predator responses. Our analyses revealed that height, season, type of predator stimulus, and mixed-species associations with capuchin monkeys (Sapajus apella) were highly related to intensity of squirrel monkey anti-predator responses. Moreover, our analyses revealed that squirrel monkeys overestimate the immediate threat of predation when individuals have incomplete information regarding the potential predator.

Poaching and habitat degradation are threats to the guanaco, a native South-American herbivore adapted to arid environments. Flight and vigilance behaviors, and guanaco-observer distances, were seasonally surveyed in mountain Andean environments, inside a protected area and surroundings. Field surveys and GIS analyses estimated environmental variables. Linear mixed models estimated probability of the mentioned behaviors and distance based on predictions about influences of human disturbance, social interactions, environmental constraints, and their changes over time. Flight and vigilance behaviors and guanaco-observer distance were higher in less protected landscapes, and near urban sites. Flight probability and guanaco-observer distance decreased over the years, being this distance shorter within the protected area. Flight decreased in summer, while vigilance increased. Vigilance was higher in groups with young, and lower in larger groups. Flight and vigilance behaviors were lower in slopes and higher in tall shrublands. These results are in agreement with hypotheses of risk-allocation, learning habituation, fitness maximization, risk detection strategy and foraging hypothesis. Social and environmental influences on guanaco behavior will probably prevail over anthropogenic influences insofar as current efforts to discourage disruptive activities are maintained in these mountain environments.","[Puig, Silvia; Videla, Fernando; Irene Rosi, Maria] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, Grp Ecol & Manejo Vertebrados Silvestres, Mendoza, Argentina",,"Puig, S (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, Grp Ecol & Manejo Vertebrados Silvestres, Mendoza, Argentina.",spuig@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar,,,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y TecnicasConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 239]; Fundacion Villavicencio,This work was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas[PIP 239]; and Fundacion Villavicencio [Proyecto 1].,,63,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0165-0521,1744-5140,,STUD NEOTROP FAUNA E,Stud.

In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, chacma baboons Papio ursinus are habitual raiders of urban and rural areas, foraging on a variety of human-derived foods. Raiding behaviour is considered a threat to human health and safety, may result in damage to property, and has adverse welfare and conservation impacts on baboons. To mitigate this conflict, Cape Town municipality employs field rangers with paintball markers that 'herd' baboons away from the urban edge. While this strategy is successful in reducing the time baboons spend in urban spaces, baboons still raid successfully. Here, we use direct observation and GPS data to investigate how one troop uses the peri-urban space and exploits human-derived foods in urban areas and on farmland. We contrast this behaviour with the individual management strategies adopted by field rangers which we assessed in individual interviews. We find that baboons utilize space (1) where inter-individual variation in field ranger management strategy is highest, (2) that is close to refuges in forested habitat and (3) that is close to the urban edge. Overall, this suggests adaptive space use by the baboons, whereby they minimize distances to refuges and potential food rewards, while exploiting uncertainty in risk variability that arises due to inter-individual differences in ranger management strategy. Together these results highlight the need for ranger consensus to reinforce management efficiency when dealing with a highly adaptive primate.","[Fehlmann, G.; Kerr-Smith, C.; King, A.

Recently, basal metabolic rate (BMR) has been suggested as a potentially important state variable underlying adaptive individual differences in a range of behaviours, including risk-taking. We tested the relationship between BMR and risk-taking in free-living great tits (Parus major) using experimental manipulations of perceived predation risk. We compared the latency of individuals to return to feeders following control (human) and predator (model sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus) disturbances at fixed feeder locations. We predicted that if variation in risk-taking is shaped by energetic constraints, high BMR individuals should return to feeders sooner following both disturbance types and show smaller changes in risk-taking as a function of predation danger. Higher BMR tended to be associated with lower risk-taking following control disturbances but greater risk-taking following predator disturbances, resulting in a significant interaction between BMR and treatment. Within-individual changes in risk-taking as a function of ambient temperature (a proxy for within-individual changes in energetic constraints) mirrored these results. Lower temperatures tended to be associated with lower risk-taking following control disturbances, but greater risk-taking following predator disturbances, resulting in a significant interaction between temperature and treatment. The effects of BMR and temperature on variation in risk-taking as a function of perceived predation danger were qualitatively similar, suggesting that energetic constraints play a role in shaping risk-taking. However, the hypothesized mechanism (energetic requirements directly influence the optimal expression of risk-taking behaviour) is insufficient to account for the observed negative relationship between energetic constraint and risk-taking following control disturbances. We conclude that variation in risk-taking is associated with differences in energetic constraints, including BMR and temperature, but that the relationship is context-specific, here high vs. low perceived predation risk. Further studies are needed to elucidate potential mechanisms that could generate context-specific relationships between energetic constraints and risk-taking.","[Mathot, Kimberley J.; Nicolaus, Marion; Araya-Ajoy, Yimen G.; Dingemanse, Niels J.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Evolutionary Ecol Variat Grp, DE-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Mathot, Kimberley J.; Nicolaus, Marion; Araya-Ajoy, Yimen G.; Dingemanse, Niels J.; Kempenaers, Bart] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, DE-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Dingemanse, Niels J.] Univ Munich, Dept Biol 2, DE-82152 Munich, Germany",,"Mathot, KJ (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Evolutionary Ecol Variat Grp, Eberhard Gwinner Str, DE-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.",kmathot@orn.mpg.de,"Nicolaus, Marion/H-6124-2015; Mathot, Kimberley/A-2544-2017; Nicolaus, Marion/AAF-7149-2021; Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020","Nicolaus, Marion/0000-0003-1808-1526; Mathot, Kimberley/0000-0003-2021-1369; Nicolaus, Marion/0000-0003-1808-1526; Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861",Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; Postdoctoral fellowships from the Alexander von Humboldt Association (AvH); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); AvH Postdoctoral Fellowship; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); International Max Planck Research School for Organismal Biology,"We thank Rob Bijlsma and the Dutch Raptor Group for the loan of sparrowhawk models, Lisa Arvidsson, Anjuli Barber, Can Kabadayi and Judit Mateos for their help in performing the feeder experiments, Peter Loes and Peter Skripsky for developing the feeders, Ariane Mutzel and Jan Wijmenga for their help with roosting inspections, Mihai Valcu for depicting Fig. 2, and members of the Evolutionary Ecology of Variation Group and Behavioural Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics Groups at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology for valuable discussions.

Despite the ongoing recovery of large carnivores in Europe and North America, few European studies on ungulate mortality are available from areas where both large carnivores and human hunters are present. We applied known fate models to estimate cause-specific mortality rates and Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the effects of environmental covariates on mortality risks of 330 radio-collared roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (1995-2005) along a gradient in roe deer abundance in south-eastern Norway. The study area is characterized by the presence of human hunters, Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and occasionally wolves (Canis lupus). The main mortality causes were: hunter harvest, predation by lynx, predation by foxes (on fawns) and others (including wolves, dogs, diseases, vehicle collisions and accidents). The individual risk of roe deer being killed by lynx or by foxes was differently affected by covariates. In keeping with the specialist foraging behavior of lynx, predation risk by lynx decreased with increasing roe deer abundance. Conversely, consistent with the opportunistic habits of red fox, the risk of being preyed upon by foxes, tended to increase with increasing roe deer abundance, although the pattern was not so marked. Human hunters did not adjust their killing rate to changing roe deer abundance and annually harvested between 11% and 28% of the population according to different sexes and age classes.","[Melis, Claudia] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Nilsen, Erlend B.; Panzacchi, Manuela; Linnell, John D.

However, living in HMLs demands behavioral adaptations, and the proximity between wildlife and people heightens human-wildlife conflicts. Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a thriving rodent species in HMLs in Brazil and as such, is involved in human-wildlife conflicts, such as vehicle collisions and transmission of Brazilian spotted fever (BSF). Despite their public importance, the effects of HMLs on capybara movement behavior have never been investigated. Our study aimed to investigate changes in home range, ranging pattern, and activity, for capybaras in six HMLs and two natural landscapes (NLs) by monitoring capybaras with GPS collars. We found home ranges 2.43 times greater in NLs than in HMLs and differences in ranging pattern in HMLs. Capybaras tended to be more nocturnal and move shorter distances across HMLs than NLs. Our results confirm the impacts of the HMLs altering capybara movement. The aggregation of capybaras in very small home ranges might imply on greater risks of tick infestations. In addition, capybara-vehicle collision may be increased during capybaras' nocturnal activity. Therefore, we recommend that transportation agencies avoid the construction of transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, airstrips) in capybaras' home ranges, which should be of restricted access to people in BSF endemic areas.","[Lopes, Beatriz; Micchi de Barros Ferraz, Katia Maria Paschoaletto] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ciencias Florestais, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [McEvoy, John F.; Leimgruber, Peter] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Front Royal, VA USA; [Luz, Hermes R.] Univ Fed Maranhao, Sao Lids, Ponto Focal Maranhao, Programa Posgrad Biotecnol Renorbio, Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil; [Morato, Ronaldo Goncalves] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade, Ctr Nacl Pesquisa & Conservacao Mamiferos Carnivo, Atibaia, SP, Brazil; [Luz, Hermes R.; Benatti, Hector Ribeiro; Labruna, Marcelo B.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Costa, Francisco B.] Univ Estadual Maranhao, Fac Med Vet, Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil; [Dias, Thiago da Costa; Rocha, Vlamir Jose] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Ciencias Nat Matemat & Educ, Araras, SP, Brazil; [do Nascimento, Vanessa Ramos] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Fac Med Vet, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Piovezan, Ubiratan] EMBRAPA, Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros, Aracaju, SE, Brazil; [Monticelli, Patricia Ferreira; Nievas, Ana Maria] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Filosofia Ciencias & Letras Ribeirao Preto, Dept Psicol, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Pacheco, Richard Campos] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Fac Med Vet, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Vet, Cuiaba, MT, Brazil; [Gaglianone Moro, Maria Estela] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Zootecnia & Engn Alimentos, Dept Med Vet, Pirassununga, SP, Brazil; [Brasil, Jardel] Secretaria Municipal Saude Amer, Prefeitura Amer, Americana, SP, Brazil",,"Lopes, B (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ciencias Florestais, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",beatriz2.lopes@usp.br,"McEvoy, John/S-7347-2019; MONTICELLI, PATRICIA FERREIRA/U-6112-2019; Pacheco, Richard Campos/H-6190-2013; Leimgruber, Peter/O-1304-2015","McEvoy, John/0000-0003-3596-5745; MONTICELLI, PATRICIA FERREIRA/0000-0002-9546-4160; Pacheco, Richard Campos/0000-0002-7135-1516; Leimgruber, Peter/0000-0002-3682-0153","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/180467, 2014/27078-2, 2016/17941-0]; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [308503/2014-7, 308632/2018-4]","@ This study has been supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (processes 2013/180467, 2014/27078-2, 2016/17941-0).

Here we examine the ways in which microhabitat structure and predation risk affect the habitat preference of wild patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). Patas monkeys in Kenya are typically restricted to Acacia drepanolobium habitat, but within our study group's home range, there are two distinct microhabitats, one with taller trees ('tall microhabitat') and one with apparently perennially shorter trees ('short microhabitat'). Examination of ranging behavior indicates that the patas monkeys preferred the tall microhabitat. In the tall microhabitat, focal animals climbed into trees that were significantly taller than average, indicating that they preferred tall trees. Female patas monkeys spent more time scanning from tall trees than from short trees and detected predators only from taller than average trees, based on alarm call data. Their use of tall trees may have decreased their predation risk by increasing their ability to detect predators. We found no evidence of increased food availability or reduced predator presence in the tall microhabitat that could contribute to the monkeys' preference for the tall microhabitat.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Enstam, KL (corresponding author), Sonoma State Univ, Dept Anthropol Linguist, 1801 E Cotati Ave, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA.",karin.enstam@sonoma.edu,,,NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR 00169] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P51RR000169] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,46,24,35,0,25,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0015-5713,,,FOLIA PRIMATOL,Folia Primatol.,,2004,75,2,,,,,70,84,,10.1159/000076265,,,15,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,801KP,WOS:000220095100002,15010579,,,,2022-04-19,

Movement rates of Stone's sheep followed consistent yearly patterns, with highest rates occurring in summer and fall. Models that contained vegetation, topography, and risk of predation best explained resource selection. Topographic features ranked better, however, than components of vegetation or risk of predation from grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) at explaining habitat selection. Selection strategies were variable among groups of Stone's sheep and between years within groups even though consistencies in selection for steep slopes, ridge-like topography, south aspects, and upper elevations were common. This research provides the first comprehensive analysis of habitat selection by Stone's sheep, which show strong fidelity to seasonal ranges but also exhibit behavioural plasticity in selection of attributes within those ranges.","Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada",,"Parker, KL (corresponding author), Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",parker@unbc.ca,,,,,,79,26,28,1,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2007,14,1,,,,,55,70,,10.2980/1195-6860(2007)14[55:HSBFSS]2.0.CO;2,,,16,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,152LY,WOS:000245364700008,,,,,2022-04-19,

While the effect of predators on populations is well established, disturbance by humans is increasingly being identified as affecting the behaviour and reproductive success of animals and can have significant impacts on their survival. We used a concurrent analysis of two adjacent giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis populations in Kenya to determine whether human activities and high predation affected their social networks. One study site was a premier tourist destination with a high volume of human activity in the form of tourist traffic and lodge infrastructure, alongside a high density of lions which preferentially prey on giraffe calves; the other was a private wildlife conservancy with minimal human activity and no lion population. Giraffes in both networks showed preferred associations and avoidances of other individuals, which were independent of space use. Bond strength was lower in the population exposed to high levels of human activity and lions, and the network had lower density and clustering, and shorter path lengths, suggesting that it was more fragmented. We suggest that human activity and predator density may influence the patterns of social interactions in giraffes and highlight the importance of understanding the impact of tourism and management on the survival and success of wild animal populations.","[Muller, Zoe; Cuthill, Innes C.; Harris, Stephen] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Muller, Zoe] Giraffe Res & Conservat Trust, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Muller, Z (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",muller.zoe@gmail.com,"Muller, Zoe/W-4225-2019","Muller, Zoe/0000-0002-7238-6702",Columbus Zoo and Aquarium; Chicago Zoological Society; Denver Zoo; Dublin Zoo; Chester Zoo; Oklahoma City Zoo; Phoenix Zoo; SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund; People's Trust for Endangered Species; Greenville Zoo; Mohammed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund; Stichting Lucie Burgers; Fresno Chaffee Zoo,"Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, Grant/Award Number: NA; Chicago Zoological Society, Grant/Award Number: NA; Denver Zoo, Grant/Award Number: NA; Dublin Zoo, Grant/Award Number: NA; Chester Zoo, Grant/Award Number: NA; Oklahoma City Zoo, Grant/Award Number: NA; Phoenix Zoo, Grant/Award Number: NA; SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, Grant/Award Number: NA; People's Trust for Endangered Species, Grant/Award Number: NA; Greenville Zoo, Grant/Award Number: NA; Mohammed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, Grant/Award Number: NA; Stichting Lucie Burgers, Grant/Award Number: NA; Fresno Chaffee Zoo, Grant/Award Number: NA",,142,8,8,2,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,OCT,2019,125,10,,,,,702,715,,10.1111/eth.12923,,AUG 2019,14,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,IV9ZH,WOS:000480080000001,,Green Submitted,,,2022-04-19,

Marine mammals may be negatively affected by anthropogenic noise. Behavioural response studies (BRS) aim to establish a relationship between noise exposure conditions (dose) from a potential stressor and associated behavioural responses of animals. A recent series of BRS have focused on the effects of naval sonar sounds on cetaceans. Here, we review the current state of understanding of naval sonar impact on marine mammals and highlight knowledge gaps and future research priorities. 2. Many marine mammal species exhibit responses to naval sonar sounds. However, responses vary between and within individuals and populations, highlighting the importance of exposure context in modulating dose-response relationships. 3. There is increasing support from both terrestrial and marine systems for the risk-disturbance hypothesis as an explanation for underlying response processes. This proposes that sonar sounds may be perceived by animals as a threat, evoking a response shaped by the underlying species-specific risk of predation and anti-predator strategy. An understanding of responses within both the dose-response and risk-disturbance frameworks may enhance our ability to predict responsiveness for unstudied species and populations. 4. Many observed behavioural responses are energetically costly, but the way that these responses may lead to long-term individual and population-level impacts is poorly understood. 5. Synthesis and applications. Behavioural response studies have greatly improved our understanding of the potential effects of naval sonar on marine mammals. Despite data gaps, we believe a dose-response approach within a risk-disturbance framework will enhance our ability to predict responsiveness for unstudied species and populations. We advocate for (1) regulatory frameworks to utilize peer-reviewed research findings when making predictions of impact, (2) regulatory frameworks to account for the inherent uncertainty in predictions of impact and (3) investment in monitoring programmes that are both directed by recent research and offer opportunities for validation of predictions at the individual and population level.","[Harris, Catriona M.; Thomas, Len] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, Observ, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Falcone, Erin A.] Marine Ecol & Telemetry Res, Seabeck, WA USA; [Hildebrand, John] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA; [Houser, Dorian] Natl Marine Mammal Fdn, San Diego, CA USA; [Kvadsheim, Petter H.] Norwegian Def Res Estab FFI, Maritime Syst, Horten, Norway; [Lam, Frans-Peter A.] Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res TNO, Acoust & Sonar Res Grp, The Hague, Netherlands; [Miller, Patrick J.

Its stability and timing have been accorded significance in terms of evolution, maximal fitness and the onset of ageing. The nadir of mortality in developed nations now lies at 5-9 years, significantly predating fertility at a mean of 12-13. This differential fall in mortality has resulted in England and Wales primarily but not exclusively from reductions in accidents and deaths from congenital anomalies. The assumption that the nadir of mortality, onset of fertility and a putative intrinsic point of maximal biological fitness are synchronous is disproved by this shift. In this paper the logic of inferring an individual modal pattern of ageing from mean population behaviour is questioned, and the plausibility of the belief that ageing starts at or after fertility is examined. Biological ageing, whether seen as 'wear and tear', programmed change, or cumulative stochastic damage appears to commence at or before conception. Drawing a distinction between 'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' mortality makes less sense in early than in late life, but indicators of 'intrinsic' diseases are also present from well before fertility. Similarly, measures of fitness other than mortality risk may also be argued to diminish from before birth. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This behavioural measure of risk-taking reflects the risk of being captured by real predators, and it correlates with a range of life history traits, as expected if flight distance optimizes risk of predation. Given that FID provides information on risk of predation, we should expect that physiological and morphological mechanisms that facilitate flight and escape predict interspecific variation in flight distance. Haematocrit is a measure of packed red blood cell volume and as such indicates the oxygen transport ability and hence the flight muscle contracting reaction of an individual. Therefore, we predicted that species with short flight distances, that allow close proximity between a potential prey individual and a predator, would have high haematocrit. Furthermore, we predicted that species with large wing areas and hence relatively low costs of flight and species with large aspect ratios and hence high manoeuvrability would have evolved long flight speed. Consistent with these predictions, we found in a sample of 63 species of birds that species with long flight distances for their body size had low levels of haematocrit and large wing areas and aspect ratios. These findings provide evidence consistent with the evolution of risk-taking behaviour being underpinned by physiological and morphological mechanisms that facilitate escape from predators and add to our understanding of predatorprey coevolution.","[Moller, A.

Iguanas were exposed to an approaching person either with an exposed face or with the face covered with hair. In the latter case the iguanas received the conflicting stimuli of a person both approaching, yet appearing to retreat. Iguanas moved earlier, ran earlier, and ran farther when the approaching person had an exposed face compared to a face hidden by hair. For iguanas exposed to a face there were significant correlations between the escape behaviors; iguanas that moved and ran earlier also ran farther.

Charadrii) every year. To identify locations where shorebirds concentrate and to determine the impact of human activity and habitat characteristics on shorebirds, we conducted shorebird and visitor surveys at 20 beach sectors (across 20 total km of beach) during fall migration in 2011-2014 and spring migration in 2012 and 2013. Using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and a model selection approach, we found that beach width and number of people influenced shorebird use of beach sectors (Bayesian information criterion weight of top model = 0.69). Shorebird absence from beaches was associated with increasing number of people (parameter estimate from top model: 0.38; 95 % CI 0.19, 0.57) and decreasing beach width (parameter estimate: -0.32; 95 % CI -0.47, -0.17). Shorebirds spent more time at wider beaches (parameter estimate: 0.68; 95 % CI 0.49, 0.87). Close proximity to people increased the proportion of time shorebirds spent moving, while shorebirds spent more time moving and less time foraging on wider beaches than on narrower ones. Shorebird disturbance increased with proximity of people, activity speed, and presence of dogs. Based on our findings, management options, for reducing shorebird disturbance at Pacific Rim National Park Reserve and similar shorebird stopover areas, include mandatory buffer distances between people and shorebirds, restrictions on fast-moving activities (e.g., running, biking), prohibiting dogs, and seasonal closures of wide beach sections.","[Murchison, Colleen R.] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Murchison, Colleen R.] Pk Canada, Nunavut Field Unit, Box 278, Iqaluit, NU X0A 0H0, Canada; [Zharikov, Yuri] Pacific Rim Natl Pk Reserve, Box 280, Ucluelet, BC V0R 3A0, Canada; [Nol, Erica] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, 2140 East Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9L 0G2, Canada; [Nol, Erica] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, 2140 East Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9L 0G2, Canada",,"Murchison, CR (corresponding author), Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.; Murchison, CR (corresponding author), Pk Canada, Nunavut Field Unit, Box 278, Iqaluit, NU X0A 0H0, Canada.",colleen.murchison@pc.gc.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Parks Canada, the Government of Ontario; Trent University","We thank the staff at Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, Danielle Gough, Christine Anderson, and Angus Smith for logistical and field assistance.

Flight initiation distances (FIDs) are often used to inform development of appropriate buffer distances required for human exclusion zones used to protect birds nesting in anthropogenic landscapes. Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) are protected by the Endangered Species Act in the United States and often nest in areas used by humans. Studies evaluating Piping Plover FIDs are limited and implementation of exclusion zones has been inconsistent across the species' range. We measured Piping Plover response and FIDs to naturally occurring stimuli on public beaches at Lake McConaughy, Nebraska, USA. Piping Plover FIDs differed most by stimulus class (vehicle, human, dog, human with dog), Julian day, and hour of day. Piping Plover FIDs were greatest for dog and human with dog compared to humans and vehicles. For all types of stimuli, Piping Plover FIDs decreased over time during the nesting season and increased slightly during each day. In the majority of instances in which Piping Plovers left their nests, return times to the nest were relatively short (less than three minutes). These results suggest Piping Plovers become habituated to the presence of human-related stimuli over the course of a nesting season, but other explanations such as parental investment and risk allocation cannot be excluded. Additional research and improved guidance regarding the implementation of exclusion zones is needed so managers can implement effective protection programs in anthropogenic landscapes.","[Jorgensen, Joel G.; Dinan, Lauren R.] Nebraska Game & Pk Commiss, Nongame Bird Program, Lincoln, NE USA; [Brown, Mary Bomberger] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Jorgensen, JG (corresponding author), 2200 N 33rd St, Lincoln, NE 68503 USA.",joel.jorgensen@nebraska.gov,,,Nebraska State Wildlife Grants program; Nebraska Environmental Trust; Nebraska Game and Parks Commission; Nebraska Wildlife Conservation Fund; University of Nebraska School of Natural Resources,"Principal funding for this project was provided by the Nebraska State Wildlife Grants program with additional support provided by the Nebraska Environmental Trust, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, Nebraska Wildlife Conservation Fund, and University of Nebraska School of Natural Resources.

Amplitude reduction of the P300 event-related potential component reflects attention-mediated processing deficits and is among the most replicated biological findings in schizophrenia, making it a candidate biomarker of psychosis risk. The relative extent to which deficits in P300 amplitudes elicited by auditory and visual oddball stimuli precede psychosis onset during the PRS and predict transition to psychosis, however, remains unclear. Forty-three individuals meeting PRS criteria, 19 schizophrenia patients, and 43 healthy control (HC) participants completed baseline electroencephalography recording during separate auditory and visual oddball tasks. Two subcomponents of P300 were measured: P3b, elicited by infrequent target stimuli, and P3a, elicited by infrequent nontarget novel stimuli. Auditory and visual target P3b and novel P3a amplitudes were reduced in PRS and schizophrenia participants relative to HC participants. In addition, baseline auditory and visual target P3b, but not novel P3a, amplitudes were reduced in 15 PRS participants who later converted to psychosis, relative to 18 PRS non-converters who were followed for at least 22 months. Furthermore, target P3b amplitudes predicted time to psychosis onset among PRS participants. These results suggest that P300 amplitude deficits across auditory and visual modalities emerge early in the schizophrenia illness course and precede onset of full psychosis. Moreover, target P3b may represent an important neurophysiological vulnerability marker of the imminence of risk for psychosis.","[Hamilton, Holly K.; Roach, Brian J.; Llerena, Katiah; Ford, Judith M.; Mathalon, Daniel H.] San Francisco Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Mental Hlth Serv, San Francisco, CA USA; [Hamilton, Holly K.; Llerena, Katiah; Ford, Judith M.; Mathalon, Daniel H.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, San Francisco, CA USA; [Woods, Scott W.; McGlashan, Thomas H.; Srihari, Vinod H.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Roach, Brian J.] Northern Calif Inst Res & Educ, San Francisco, CA USA",,"Mathalon, DH (corresponding author), 4150 Clement St,116D, San Francisco, CA 94121 USA.",daniel.mathalon@ucsf.edu,"Srihari, Vinod H./B-9040-2018; /AAF-4811-2020; Llerena, Katiah/O-9969-2014","Srihari, Vinod H./0000-0003-1556-2332; /0000-0002-3103-5228; Llerena, Katiah/0000-0002-9769-172X","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH076989, U01 MH082022, K02 MH067967]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation; Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Academic Affiliations Advanced Fellowship Program in Mental Illness Research and Treatment and Sierra-Pacific Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001863] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [U01MH082022] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH076989, U01 MH082022, K02 MH067967); Brain and Behavior Research Foundation; Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Academic Affiliations Advanced Fellowship Program in Mental Illness Research and Treatment and Sierra-Pacific Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center.",,124,23,25,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0586-7614,1745-1701,,SCHIZOPHRENIA BULL,Schizophr.

Cheek pouch use may mitigate interspecific competition and predator risk by reducing the time spent in areas of high competition/predator risk. I investigated these ideas in three forest guenons: Campbell's monkey (Cercopithecus campbelli), spot-nosed monkey (C. petaurista), and Diana monkey (C. diana). I present 13 months of scan sample data from Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire, including 3,675, 3,330, and 5,689 records of cheek pouch distention, to quantify cheek pouch use, for Campbell's, spot-nosed, and Diana monkeys, respectively. Cheek pouches are often used to hold fruit, so I first predicted that the most frugivorous species, Diana monkeys, would have the most cheek pouch distension. Spot-nosed monkeys ate the least amount of fruit over the study period and had the least distended cheek pouches, suggesting the importance of frugivory in relation to cheek pouch distension for this species. This was not a sufficient explanation for Campbell's monkeys; Campbell's ate fruit less than Diana monkeys, but had more distended cheek pouches, suggesting that cheek pouch use was not simply a reflection of high frugivory. From the interspecific competition hypothesis, I predicted that Campbell's monkeys would have more distended cheek pouches than Diana and spot-nosed monkeys, and more distended cheek pouches when associated with Diana because Campbell's monkeys have the highest potential for interspecific competition with dominant Diana monkeys. From the predator risk hypothesis, I predicted that Campbell's would have more distended cheek pouches when not associated with highly vigilant Diana monkeys. Campbell's monkeys had the most distended cheek pouches overall, but had more distended cheek pouches when not in association with Diana, suggesting the greater importance of predator risk rather than interspecific competition in Campbell's cheek pouch use.","Columbia Univ, Dept Anthropol, New York, NY 10027 USA; NYCEP, New York, NY USA",,"Buzzard, PJ (corresponding author), 10388 N 1st St, Altamont, IL 62411 USA.",cercopithecus@hotmail.com,,,,,,28,13,14,0,16,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0032-8332,1610-7365,,PRIMATES,Primates,OCT,2006,47,4,,,,,336,341,,10.1007/s10329-006-0188-6,,,6,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,101YO,WOS:000241777700007,16645704,,,,2022-04-19,

In agreement with this model, a prior unit-recording study in rats performing a seminaturalistic foraging task revealed that many lateral amygdala (LA) neurons are predator responsive. In contrast, our previous study emphasized that most basolateral (BL) amygdala neurons are inhibited at proximity of the predator. However, the two studies used different methods to analyze unit activity, complicating comparisons between them. By applying the same method to the sample of BL neurons we recorded previously, the present study revealed that most principal cells are inhibited by the predator and only 4.5% are activated. Moreover, two-thirds of these cells were also activated by nonthreatening stimuli. In fact, fitting unit activity with a generalized linear model revealed that the only task variables associated with a prevalent positive modulation of BL activity were expectation of the predator's presence and whether the prior trial had been a failure or success. At odds with the threat-coding model of the amygdala, actual confrontation with the predator was usually associated with a widespread inhibition of principal BL neurons. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The basolateral amygdala (BL) is thought to contain neurons that signal threat, in turn eliciting defensive behaviors. In contrast, the present study reports that very few principal BL cells are responsive to threats and that most of them are also activated by nonthreatening stimuli. Yet, expectation of the threat's presence was associated with a prevalent positive modulation of BL activity; actual confrontation with the threat was associated with a widespread inhibition.","[Amir, Alon; Kyriazi, Pinelopi; Lee, Seung-Chan; Headley, Drew B.; Pare, Denis] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Newark, NJ USA; [Kyriazi, Pinelopi] Rutgers State Univ, Behav & Neural Sci Grad Program, Newark, NJ USA",,"Pare, D (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, 197 Univ Ave, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",pare@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH107239, R01 MH112505]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH107239, R01MH112505] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This material is based on work supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grants R01 MH107239 and R01 MH112505 (to D.

Using anti-predator behaviors as proxies for perceived pressure is appealing because of the relative ease with which they can be recorded and the presumed relationship between the threat of interest and a predator stimulus. However, behaviors are plastic and affected by factors unrelated to human activity. Consequently, it is critical to assess the relationship between behavioral indicators and their context before interpretation. In this study we used a combination of behavior, movement and demography from a threatened population of African elephants in northern Kenya to determine whether reaction to research vehicles was indicative of poaching pressure. We used mixed-effects models predicting reaction of elephants to observer vehicle approaches in which we treated individuals as random effects and included ecological, anthropogenic, spatial, social and demographic predictor variables. Contrary to our hypothesis, recorded levels of reactive behavior did not increase with poaching levels in either a population-level dataset or a data subset of individuals whose spatial behavior was precisely known via radio-tracking. Rather, primary productivity positively predicted reactive behavior in both datasets. This relationship was heightened by the presence of musth males in the radio-collar dataset. Reactivity was not related to the time since entering the protected areas, but increased among groups that spent less time in the protected areas. Inter-individual differences were apparent, suggesting the importance of inherent differences (e.g. personality) across groups. In our study, elephants plagued by a severe human threat did not react defensively to humans in another context, suggesting nuanced discrimination of threats. Our study demonstrates the caution that should be taken in designing studies that use behavioral indices to represent threat and contributes to a growing body of literature employing behavioral indicators to monitor wildlife populations of conservation concern.","[Goldenberg, S.

Here we demonstrate with experiments that wild American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos, respond to dead conspecifics by mobbing, increasing the time to approach food in areas associated with these events, and learning new predators based on their proximity to dead crows and hawks. Avoidance of either dead conspecifics or areas associated with them is not shared by another urban bird, the rock pigeon, Columba livia. Crows mobbed and increased the time to approach food over the next 72 h after observing novel humans paired with a dead crow, a red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis, or a hawk with a dead crow. The sight of a dead pigeon did not elicit these responses. These findings suggest that, for crows, dead conspecifics, but not dead heterospecifics, represent a salient danger akin to the observation of a predator. On the day the stimulus was presented, the number of trials that resulted in mobbing and avoidance of the food was strongest when crows were presented a hawk with a dead crow. In addition, we demonstrate that crows use the proximity of a human to predators, to dead conspecifics and to predators with dead conspecifics as cues to learn to recognize and subsequently scold the associated human after only one training event, and that this association can last 6 weeks. Together, our results support previous findings that crows learn places associated with conspecific death, and further demonstrate that crows can learn and remember people who appear complicit in these events.

While observational data from systematic camera arrays have informed inferences on the spatiotemporal outcomes of predator-prey interactions, the capacity for observational studies to identify mechanistic drivers of species interactions is limited. Experimental study designs that utilize camera traps uniquely allow for testing hypothesized mechanisms that drive predator and prey behaviour, incorporating environmental realism not possible in the laboratory while benefiting from the distinct capacity of camera traps to generate large datasets from multiple species with minimal observer interference. However, such pairings of camera traps with experimental methods remain underutilized. We review recent advances in the experimental application of camera traps to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying predator-prey ecology and present a conceptual guide for designing experimental camera trap studies. Only 9% of camera trap studies on predator-prey ecology in our review use experimental methods, but the application of experimental approaches is increasing. To illustrate the utility of camera trap-based experiments using a case study, we propose a study design that integrates observational and experimental techniques to test a perennial question in predator-prey ecology: how prey balance foraging and safety, as formalized by the risk allocation hypothesis. We discuss applications of camera trap-based experiments to evaluate the diversity of anthropogenic influences on wildlife communities globally. Finally, we review challenges to conducting experimental camera trap studies. Experimental camera trap studies have already begun to play an important role in understanding the predator-prey ecology of free-living animals, and such methods will become increasingly critical to quantifying drivers of community interactions in a rapidly changing world. We recommend increased application of experimental methods in the study of predator and prey responses to humans, synanthropic and invasive species, and other anthropogenic disturbances.","[Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Hunter, Jennifer S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Hastings Nat Hist Reservat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Keller, Carson B.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Palmer, Meredith S.; Atkins, Justine L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Castaneda, Irene] Sorbonne Univ, MNHN, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, CNRS,UPMC,UMR 7204, Paris, France; [Castaneda, Irene] Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Ecol Systemat & Evolut, UMR 8079, Orsay, France; [Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX USA; [Garvey, Patrick M.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Huebner, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Coll Biol Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Morin, Dana J.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Starkville, MS USA; [Teckentrup, Lisa] Univ Potsdam, BioMove Res Training Grp, Potsdam, Germany; [Weterings, Martijn J.

The test apparatus consisted of a figure-eight maze with three parallel arms interconnected at each extremity to a perpendicular arm. A taxidermized oncilla cat (Felis tigrina) was placed outside the maze facing one of its corners. Subjects were submitted to seven 30 min maze habituation trials (HTs), in the absence of the 'predator', and then to six 30 min treatment trials (TTs), in the presence of the 'predator', consisting of four doses of SP1-7 (5, 50, 250 and 500 mug/kg; IP), saline and sham injection. SP1-7 treatment reversed, in a dose-dependent way, the fear-induced avoidance behavior due to the predator's presence and increased the frequency of exploratory behaviors. Locomotor activity decreased during successive HTs, yet increased after all SP1-7 treatments. These results indicate that systemic administration of SP1-7 produces anxiolytic-like effects in marmosets tested in the predator confrontation model of fear/anxiety. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Understanding how animals perceive and learn about dangers and rewards can aid conservationists seeking to limit abundant or restore rare species (Schakner and Blumstein, 2016; Greggor et al., 2014; Angeloni et al., 2008; Fernandez-Juricic and Schulte, 2016). Cognition research is informing conservation science by suggesting how naive prey learn novel predators (Griffin et al., 2000; Moseby et al., 2015; Schakner et al., 2016; Blumstein, 2016), the mechanisms underlying variation in tolerance of human disturbance (Bostwick et al., 2014), and when natural aversions and fear learning can be leveraged to humanely control predators (Nielsen et al., 2015; Colman et al., 2014; Norbury et al., 2014; Lance et al., 2010; Cross et al., 2013). Insights into the relationships between cognition and adaptability suggest that behavioral inflexibility often presages species rarity (Amiel et al., 2011; Reif et al., 2011; Sol et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014; but see Kellert, 1984). Human compassion and restraint are ultimately required to conserve species. Cognitive science can therefore further inform conservation by revealing the complex inner worlds of the animals we threaten and, in partnership with environmental psychologists, explore how such newfound knowledge affects our empathy for other species and ultimately the public's actions on behalf of species in need of conservation.","[Marzluff, John M.; Swift, Kaeli N.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Marzluff, JM; Swift, KN (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",corvid@uw.edu; kaelis@uw.edu,,"Marzluff, John/0000-0002-6266-4975",,,,64,5,5,2,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-1546,2352-1554,,CURR OPIN BEHAV SCI,Curr.

Human presence is an inherent component of ecotourism, which can impact animal behavior because animals often perceive humans as predators and, consequently, spend more time on human-directed antipredator behaviors and less on other fitness-relevant activities. We tested whether human clothing color affects water anole (Anolis aquaticus) behavior at a popular ecotourism destination in Costa Rica, testing the hypothesis that animals are more tolerant of humans wearing their sexually selected signaling color. We examined whether clothing resembling the primary signaling color (orange) of water anoles increases number of anole sightings and ease of capture. Research teams mimicked an ecotourism group by searching for anoles wearing one of three shirt treatments: orange, green, or blue. We conducted surveys at three different sites: a primary forest, secondary forest, and abandoned pasture. Wearing orange clothing resulted in more sightings and greater capture rates compared with blue or green. A higher proportion of males were captured when wearing orange whereas sex ratios of captured anoles were more equally proportional in the surveys when observers wore green or blue. We also found that capture success was greater when more people were present during a capture attempt. We demonstrate that colors displayed by perceived predators (i.e., humans) alter antipredator behaviors in water anoles. Clothing choice could have unintended impacts on wildlife, and wearing colors resembling the sexually selected signaling color might enhance tolerance toward humans. in Spanish is available with online material.","[Fondren, Andrea] Iowa State Univ, Coll Agr & Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Swierk, Lindsey] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY USA; [Putman, Breanna J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Putman, Breanna J.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Sect Herpetol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Putman, Breanna J.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Urban Nat Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Putman, Breanna J.] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Biol, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA",,"Fondren, A (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Coll Agr & Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",afondren@iastate.edu,,"Swierk, Lindsey/0000-0001-7897-0275",NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Research Experience program for Undergraduates in Costa Rica,NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Research Experience program for Undergraduates in Costa Rica,,88,2,2,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0006-3606,1744-7429,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,JAN,2020,52,1,,,,,172,181,,10.1111/btp.12744,,DEC 2019,10,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KG2SX,WOS:000502975600001,,,,,2022-04-19,

We believe that an explicit description of this vulnerability will provide many insights into both the function and architecture (or organization) of sleep. Early studies of sleep recognized this idea, but it has been largely overlooked during the last 20 years. We critically evaluate early models that suggested that the function of sleep is antipredator in nature, and outline a new model in which we argue that whole-brain or 'blackout' sleep may be the safest way to sleep given a functionally interconnected brain. Early comparative work also suggested that the predatory environment is an important determinant of sleep architecture. For example, species that sleep in risky environments spend less time in the relatively vulnerable states of sleep. Recent experimental work suggests that mammals and birds shift to relatively vigilant (lighter) states of sleep in response to an increase in perceived risk; these results mirror the influence of stress on sleep in humans and rats. We also outline a conceptual model of sleep architecture in which dynamic changes in sleep states reflect a trade-off between the benefits of reducing a sleep debt and the cost of predation. Overall, many aspects of plasticity in sleep related to predation risk require further study, as do the ways in which sleeping animals monitor predatory threats. More work outside of the dominant mammalian paradigm in sleep is also needed. An ecologically based view of sleeping under the risk of predation will provide an important complement to the traditional physiological and neurological approaches to studying sleep and its functions. 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The rapid increase of human activity in wild and developed areas presents novel challenges for wildlife. Some species may use human-dominated landscapes because of favourable resources (e.g. high prey availability along roadsides); however, use of these areas may increase exposure to anthropogenic stressors, such as human disturbance or noise, which can negatively affect reproduction or survival. In this case, human-dominated landscapes may act as an ecological trap. 2. We evaluated whether American kestrel Falco sparverius reproductive failure was associated with human disturbance (traffic conditions and land development) or other common predictors of reproductive outcome, such as habitat and clutch initiation date. Also, we examined relationships among human disturbance, corticosterone (CORT) concentrations and nest abandonment to explore potential mechanisms for stress-induced reproductive failure. 3. Twenty-six (36%) of 73 kestrel nesting attempts failed and 88% of failures occurred during incubation. Kestrels nesting in higher disturbance areas were 9<bold>9</bold> times more likely to fail than kestrels nesting in lower disturbance areas. Habitat and clutch initiation date did not explain reproductive outcome. 4. Females in higher disturbance areas had higher CORT and were more likely to abandon nests than females in lower disturbance areas. There was no relationship between male CORT and disturbance or abandonment. Females spent more time incubating than males and may have had more exposure to anthropogenic stressors. Specifically, traffic noise may affect a cavity-nesting bird's perception of the outside environment by masking auditory cues. In response, incubating birds may perceive a greater predation risk, increase vigilance behaviour, decrease parental care, or both. 5. Synthesis and applications. Proximity to large, busy roads and developed areas negatively affected kestrel reproduction by causing increased stress hormones that promoted nest abandonment. These results demonstrate that species presence in a human-dominated landscape does not necessarily indicate a tolerance for anthropogenic stressors. Managers should carefully consider or discourage projects that juxtapose favourable habitat conditions with areas of high human activity to decrease risk of ecological traps. Noise mitigation, while locally effective, may not protect widespread populations from the pervasive threat of traffic noise. Innovative engineering that decreases anthropogenic noise at its source is necessary.","[Strasser, Erin H.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; Boise State Univ, Raptor Res Ctr, Boise, ID 83725 USA",,"Strasser, EH (corresponding author), Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA.",erin.strasser@gmail.com,"Heath, Julie/D-5600-2011","Heath, Julie/0000-0002-9606-1689","Boise State University, the Raptor Research Center; North American Bluebird Society; Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology; Boise State University's Provost Office; NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program [EPS-0814387]","This project was supported by Boise State University, the Raptor Research Center, North American Bluebird Society, the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, Boise State University's Provost Office undergraduate research work study funds and the NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program (EPS-0814387).

Juvenile and adult rats emit 22-kHz USV in aversive situations, such as predator exposure and fighting or during drug withdrawal, whereas 50-kHz USV occur in appetitive situations, such as rough-and-tumble play and mating or in response to drugs of abuse, e.g., amphetamine. Aversive 22-kHz USV and appetitive 50-kHz USV serve distinct communicative functions. Whereas 22-kHz USV induce freezing behavior in the receiver, 50-kHz USV lead to social approach behavior. These opposite behavioral responses are paralleled by distinct patterns of brain activation. Freezing behavior in response to 22-kHz USV is paralleled by increased neuronal activity in brain areas regulating fear and anxiety, such as the amygdala and periaqueductal gray, whereas social approach behavior elicited by 50-kHz USV is accompanied by reduced activity levels in the amygdala but enhanced activity in the nucleus accumbens, a brain area implicated in reward processing. These opposing behavioral responses, together with distinct patterns of brain activation, particularly the bidirectional tonic activation or deactivation of the amygdala elicited by 22-kHz and 50-kHz USV, respectively, concur with a wealth of behavioral and neuroimaging studies in humans involving emotionally salient stimuli, such as fearful and happy facial expressions. Affective ultrasonic communication therefore offers a translational tool for studying the neurobiology underlying socio-affective communication. This is particularly relevant for rodent models of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social and communication deficits, such as autism and schizophrenia.","[Woehr, Markus; Schwarting, Rainer K.

Prior social science research on this topic is limited and has emphasized feral cats even though owned cats often comprise a large proportion of the outdoor cat population, particularly in urban areas. To address this gap, we examined public risk perceptions and attitudes toward outdoor pet cats across varying levels of urbanization, including along the wildland-urban interface, in Colorado (U.S.A.), through a mail survey of 1397 residents. Residents did not view all types of risks uniformly. They viewed risks of cat predation on wildlife and carnivore predation on cats as more likely than disease-related risks. Additionally, risk perceptions were related to attitudes, prior experiences with cats and cat-wildlife interactions, and cat-owner behavior. Our findings suggest that changes in risk perceptions may result in behavior change. Therefore, knowledge of cat-related risk perceptions and attitudes could be used to develop communication programs aimed at promoting risk-aversive behaviors among cat owners and cat-management strategies that are acceptable to the public and that directly advance the conservation of native species. Entender las Percepciones Publicas del Riesgo respecto a los Gatos Domesticos al Aire Libre para Informar la Accion de Conservacion Los gatos domesticos sueltos (Felis catus) provocan y presentan riesgos sobre los ecosistemas y representan un tema complejo de importancia critica para la conservacion de la biodiversidad y la salud humana y felina a nivel global. Las investigaciones sociales previas sobre este tema son limitadas y han enfatizado a los gatos ferales, aunque los gatos domesticos representan una gran proporcion de la poblacion felina al aire libre, particularmente en areas urbanas. Para enfocarnos en este vacio, examinamos las percepciones publicas de riesgo y las actitudes hacia los gatos domesticos al aire libre en varios niveles de urbanizacion, incluyendo a lo largo de la interconexion urbana-silvestre en Colorado (EUA). Esto se realizo mediante una encuesta por correo aplicada a 1397 residentes, los cuales no vieron todos los tipos de riesgo uniformemente. Ellos vieron los riesgos de la depredacion de la vida silvestre por gatos y la depredacion de los gatos por carnivoros como mas probables que los riesgos relacionados con enfermedades. Adicionalmente, las percepciones de riesgo estuvieron relacionadas con actitudes, experiencias previas con gatos e interacciones gato-vida silvestre, y con el comportamiento de los duenos de los gatos. Nuestros resultados sugieren que los cambios en las percepciones de riesgo pueden derivar en cambios en el comportamiento. Por esto, el conocimiento sobre las actitudes y las percepciones de riesgo relacionados con gatos podria usarse para desarrollar programas de comunicacion enfocados en promover comportamientos que eviten riesgos entre los duenos de los gatos y estrategias que son aceptables para el publico y que avancen directamente la conservacion de las especies nativas.

Large raptors are often shown or presumed to be vulnerable to collision and are demographically sensitive to additional mortality, as exemplified by several studies of the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos. Previous findings from Scottish Eagles, however, have suggested avoidance as the primary response. Our study used data from 59 GPS-tagged Golden Eagles with 28 284 records during natal dispersal before and after turbine operation < 1 km of 569 turbines at 80 wind farms across Scotland. We tested three hypotheses using measurements of tag records' distance from the hub of turbine locations: (1) avoidance should be evident; (2) older birds should show less avoidance (i.e. habituate to turbines); and (3) rotor diameter should have no influence (smaller diameters are correlated with a turbine's age, in examining possible habituation). Four generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were constructed with intrinsic habitat preference of a turbine location using Golden Eagle Topography (GET) model, turbine operation status (before/after), bird age and rotor diameter as fixed factors. The best GLMM was subsequently verified by k-fold cross-validation and involved only GET habitat preference and presence of an operational turbine. Eagles were eight times less likely to be within a rotor diameter's distance of a hub location after turbine operation, and modelled displacement distance was 70 m. Our first hypothesis expecting avoidance was supported. Eagles were closer to turbine locations in preferred habitat but at greater distances after turbine operation. Results on bird age (no influence to 5+ years) rejected hypothesis 2, implying no habituation. Support for hypothesis 3 (no influence of rotor diameter) also tentatively inferred no habituation, but data indicated birds went slightly closer to longer rotor blades although not to the turbine tower. We proffer that understanding why avoidance or collision in large raptors may occur can be conceptually envisaged via variation in fear of humans as the 'super predator' with turbines as cues to this life-threatening agent.","[Fielding, Alan H.; Weston, Ewan; Whitfield, D.

However, little work has explored the learning of safety and how such learning outcomes are shaped by the social environment. Here, we exposed minnows, Pimephales promelas, to a high-risk environment to induce behavioural responses associated with fear (e.g. neophobia). We then used the presence of calm conspecific models (low-risk individuals) to weaken these responses. When observers (individuals from the high-risk environment) and models were paired consistently in a one-on-one setting, the observers showed no recovery (i.e. no weakening of the fear responses), and instead the models indirectly acquired those responses (i.e. a socially transmitted state of fear). However, observers paired with models that were periodically replaced with new calm models showed a significant recovery, and each new model showed diminished socially transmitted fear. We argue that our understanding of predation-related fear and social information transfer can prove fruitful in understanding problems with fear and stress across animal taxa, including among humans who experience post-traumatic stress and secondary trauma. Our findings indicate that the periodic replacement of models can promote fear recovery in observers and reduce socially transmitted fear in models.","[Crane, Adam L.; Bairos-Novak, Kevin R.; Sacco, Laurel H.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Ferrari, Maud C.

In fire-prone settings, burning is a catalyst of change, altering the distribution of both plants and animals. Recent research has shown that primates alter their behavior in response to this change. Here, we study primates' perceived threat of predation in fire-modified landscapes. We focus on the predator-related behaviors of vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) after controlled burning events. We compare the occurrence of vigilance and predator-deterrent behaviors, including alarm calls, scanning, and flight across different habitats and burn conditions to test the hypothesis that subjects exhibit fewer predator-specific vigilance and predator-deterrent behaviors in burned areas. The results demonstrate that predator-related behaviors occur less often in burned habitats, suggesting that predators are less common in these areas. These results provide foundations for examining hypotheses about the use of fire-altered landscapes among extinct hominins. We set these data in the context of increasing aridity, changes in burning regimes, and the emergence of pyrophilia in the human lineage. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The temporal scale of risk heterogeneity affects behavioral responses and determines the usefulness of metrics to quantify them. We present a conceptual framework to link anti-predator responses to risk fluctuations and appropriate metrics, based on temporal scale. We applied this framework to investigate movement responses of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) to hunting risk, measured using movement rate and home range size. Because movements are also affected by reproductive phases, we considered potential effects of the rut in parallel to hunting risk. We compared movements of male and female roe deer in a protected site versus 2 hunted sites during and outside the hunting season and rut. We detected differences in movement rates in response to different hunting management practices. We did not detect effects for hunting regimes or between sexes during the rut when using home range size as the response variable. During the hunting season, movement rates were lower in the hunted sites than in the protected site, irrespective of sex. We did not observe differences in movement rates among sites outside of the hunting season. Males had higher movement rates than females during the rut in only 1 site. Our findings supported the hypothesis that roe deer decrease movements when exposed to high hunting risk. The effect of the rut on movements was negligible except for 1 study site. We suggest that movement rate is a more useful metric than home range size for assessing movement responses to hunting.

We analyze urban and rural burrowing owls' variation in risk perception along separate but consecutive days (Treatment 1) and risk perception within the same day (Treatment 2). Fear behaviour was measured as flight initiation distances (FIDs) and aggressiveness level when a pedestrian approached repeatedly to an owl individual. We predict that the attenuation in fear response along treatments should add support to the habituation hypothesis (decrease the response to a repeatedly stimulus after verifying that it is irrelevant) while consistency in behaviour might be indicative of a personality trait. We found that FID decreased for measurements made on both treatments in rural owls and also in urban owls for Treatment 2. These results are compatible with a habituation process. We found that aggressiveness remained invariable along treatments in both habitats suggesting that different mechanisms underlie these behavioural responses. Our results suggest that owls' risk perception to humans can be adjusted based on environmental risk perception and that individuals are able to recognize and learn when a stimuli stops being a threat.,"[Cavalli, M.; Baladron, A.

Although increased tolerance may play an important role in coexistence with humans, the mechanisms and fitness outcomes of long-term changes of tolerance are not fully understood because only a few studies have assessed individual- and population-level responses over many years. We developed a novel predictive framework to study habituation and sensitization to humans and applied it to yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) in areas of high and low human disturbance. We focused on two antipredator behaviors-time allocation to vigilance during foraging to quantify baseline vigilance levels and flight initiation distance (FID)-to quantify subsequent responsiveness to threat. We used the rate of body mass gain during the active season as a fitness outcome. Assessing 15 years' population and individual-level responses to human disturbances, marmots in highly disturbed colonies allocated more time to vigilance, but this did not change over time. FID decreased on average when they were approached more and also tended to decrease in highly disturbed colonies and over 15 years. Yet, there was individuality in FIDs; marmots that fled at greater distances became sensitized with repeated approaches. Additionally, the marmots in highly disturbed colonies gained less body mass over time compared to conspecifics in less disturbed colonies. These results suggested that, although marmots habituated to humans, long-term human disturbance has negative fitness consequences. Our framework should help wildlife managers evaluate the comprehensive impact of human activities on wildlife.","[Uchida, Kenta; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Blumstein, Daniel T.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Box 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA",,"Uchida, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ku.squirrel@gmail.com,,"Uchida, Kenta/0000-0001-7998-1363; Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Geographic Society, University of California, Los Angeles (Faculty Senate); Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory research fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IDBR-0754247, DEB-1119660, 1557130, DBI 0242960, 0731346, 1226713 RMBL]; National Geographic Society, University of California, Los Angeles (Division of Life Sciences)","K.U. was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Overseas Research Fellowship.

In parallel, and in addition to traditional forensics analysis, we recommend the routine collection of shark DNA from wounds or devices following shark bite incidents in order to genetically identify the individual responsible. This approach would require creating an extensive database of shark identities in high-risk areas against which to compare DNA forensically recovered from shark bite incidents. At a local and regional scale, we propose utilizing existing shark tagging programs and artificial shark aggregation sites to collect DNA, behavioural and morphological data for the database, and to facilitate removal of problem individuals. In several places around the world, selective removal of problem individuals would not be significantly more expensive and definitely less environmentally-destructive than traditional approaches and would also help reconcile people and sharks by underlining individuality in shark behaviour.","[Clua, Eric E.

Both naive and experienced birds should thus react to such stimuli with fear reactions. However, studies on different species have shown the importance of experience in the development of these fear reactions. We hypothesized that the responses of adult European starlings to fear-inducing visual stimuli may differ according to experience. We compared the reactions of Hand-raised adults with no experience of predators to those of Wild-caught adults, with potentially extensive experience with predators. Three visual stimuli (i.e. human, raptor, snake) were broadcast to 17 birds as 2D pictures (displayed via a LCD screen) with different modalities of presentation: degree of proximity and with or without movement. The results reveal that the birds were particularly sensitive to proximity and movement, with more attention towards moving stimuli and more withdrawal for close stimuli. The human stimulus elicited attention in both the distant and moving modalities but, like the other stimuli, mostly withdrawal when it was close. Developmental experience appeared to influence the emotional level, as the Hand-raised birds reacted strongly to all stimuli and all modalities, contrarily to the WC birds which performed withdrawals almost only for close stimuli and attention to moving stimuli. Stimuli proximity and movement seemed, therefore, relevant features that elicited negative reactions in Wild-caught birds. The Hand-raised birds were equally attentive to both distant and moving stimuli. Thus the young birds showed no real discrimination. Early and later experiences may, therefore, influence birds' reactions. Starlings may require experience with real threats to develop adaptive responses, i.e. limiting unnecessary loss of energy by fleeing in front of non-dangerous stimuli.","[Belin, Laurine; Formanek, Laureline; Heyraud, Christine; Henry, Laurence] Univ Rennes, Normandie Univ, CNRS, EthoS Ethol Anim & Humaine,UMR 6552, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Hausberger, Martine] Univ Rennes, Normandie Univ, CNRS, EthoS Ethol Anim & Humaine,UMR 6552, F-35380 Paimpont, France",,"Henry, L (corresponding author), Univ Rennes, Normandie Univ, CNRS, EthoS Ethol Anim & Humaine,UMR 6552, F-35000 Rennes, France.",laurence.henry@univ-rennes1.fr,,,University of Rennes; CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission; Airbus group,"This study was funded by University of Rennes, CNRS and Airbus group.

This deficit in expression of defensive behaviour in response to conditioned stimuli is often interpreted as inability of lesioned rats to learn CS-US associations. However, findings of several studies indicate that BLC-lesioned rats can rapidly learn CS-US associations. Such findings suggest that lesioned rats can learn CS-US associations but are impaired in the expression of freezing behaviour. In the present study we report that both temporary inactivation (lidocaine) and permanent excitotoxic (NMDA) lesions of the BLC impair the unconditioned freezing and avoidance behaviours of rats in response to a novel fear-eliciting stimulus, a ball of cat hair. These findings suggest that the BLC influences the expression of freezing and avoidance behaviours, and/or that it potentiates rats' experience of fear. Along with prior evidence of spared memory for aversive learning after BLC lesions, these findings suggest that disrupted freezing to conditioned cues in BLC-lesioned rats does not necessarily reflect inability to form CS-US associations.","Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Neurobiol Learning & Memory, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"Vazdarjanova, A (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Div Neural Syst Memory & Ageing, ARL, POB 245115, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.",almira@nsma.arizona.edu,"Vazdarjanova, Almira/D-8254-2018","Vazdarjanova, Almira/0000-0002-3848-8895","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH12526] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH012526, R56MH012526, R01MH012526] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,57,102,104,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0953-816X,1460-9568,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

Here, we studied the risk-taking behavior of birds which had invaded a new natural environment, rather than an artificial urban environment, using recently established populations of the bull-headed shrike Lanius bucephalus, which naturally colonized three subtropical islands in Japan. We compared flight initiation distance (FID), the distance at which an individual approached by a human initiates flight, between the islands and the temperate mainland. FID was longer for the insular shrikes compared with the mainland shrikes after controlling for other factors, indicating that the individuals which had invaded a new natural environment had a lower propensity for risk-taking. A possible explanation for these results is that low risk-taking behavior might be adaptive on the islands due to predation by the black rat Rattus rattus, an unfamiliar predator not found in shrike habitats on the temperate mainland. Further studies are needed to examine the nest predation rate, predator species, and nest site selection of these insular shrike populations.","[Hamao, Shoji; Yoshikawa, Midori] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Zool, 4-1-1 Amakubo, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050005, Japan; [Torikai, Hisahiro] Amami Ornithologists Club, 12-8 Nazewako Cho, Amami, Kagoshima 8940007, Japan; [Yamamoto, Yutaka] Wild Bird Soc Japan, Conservat Div, Shinagawa Ku, 3-9-23 Nishi Gotanda, Tokyo 1410031, Japan; [Ijichi, Tugeru] KIKAI Inst Coral Reef Sci, 1508 Shiomichi, Kikai, Kagoshima 8916151, Japan",,"Hamao, S (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Zool, 4-1-1 Amakubo, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050005, Japan.",hamao@kahaku.go.jp,,,"National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo [20183001, 20193001]","This study was supported by the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo (Nos 20183001 and 20193001 to S.H.).",,56,0,0,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1674-5507,2396-9814,,CURR ZOOL,Curr.

Methods: Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation and unoperated control animals were assessed on two different types of emotional processing: defensive reactions to a potential predator (experiment 1) and ability to update the value of positive reinforcers, in this case food (experiment 2). Monkeys with aspiration lesions of the perirhinal cortex were also included in this study as an operated control group. Results: In experiment 1, whereas both operated groups showed reduced latencies to retrieve food located near an innately fear-provoking stimulus, a fake snake, only monkeys with hippocampal lesions displayed reduced defensive reactions to the snake. In experiment 2, both operated groups performed as well as control animals when choosing objects flexibly based on the current value of a food. Conclusions: These findings dissociate the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex in fear expression and specifically implicate the hippocampal formation in generating responses to stimuli that are potentially threatening.","[Chudasama, Yogita; Wright, Katherine S.; Murray, Elisabeth A.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Chudasama, Y (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",yogita.chudasama@mcgill.ca,"Murray, Elisabeth A./X-2051-2019","Murray, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1450-1642; Chudasama, Yogita/0000-0003-3349-8477","Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002887, Z01MH002887] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,45,52,52,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

In 1982, Yellowstone National Park created a program to protect threatened grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) from human disturbance. The bear management area (BMA) program created areas of the park where human access was restricted. The program was designed to allow unhindered foraging opportunities for bears, decrease the risk of habituation, and provide safety for backcountry users. The objective of our study was to evaluate human-bear interaction in BMAs and determine if they were effective. We used human and grizzly bear global positioning system location data to study 6 of 16 BMAs from 2007 to 2009. We contrasted data when BMAs were unrestricted (open human access) and restricted (limited human access). We used location data collected when BMAs were unrestricted to delineate a human recreation area (HRA) and determined a daily human active and inactive period. We applied the HRA and daily activity times to bear location data and evaluated how bear movement behavior changed when people were present and absent. We found that grizzly bears were twice as likely to be within the HRA when BMAs were restricted. We also found that grizzly bears were more than twice as likely to be within the HRA when BMAs were unrestricted, but people were inactive. Our results suggest that human presence can displace grizzly bears if people are allowed unrestricted access to the 6 BMAs in our study. Our study provides evidence for the utility of management closures designed to protect a threatened species in a well-visited park. Our approach can be reapplied by managers interested in balancing wildlife conservation and human recreation.

However, the lack of control over predator behavior hampers our understanding of the effect of predator attack patterns on vigilance. To circumvent this limitation, I developed a virtual experiment in which the behavior of the (virtual) predator was under full control of the experimenter. In the virtual experiment, I altered the frequency and unpredictability of attacks to document how human subjects (N = 45), which acted as surrogate prey, altered their vigilance in response to changes in predator attack patterns. Subjects increased the frequency of their vigilance bouts when the virtual predator attacked more frequently and increased vigilance bout duration when the predator attacked more unpredictably, thus showing an increase in vigilance when predation risk increased. Other features of vigilance in the virtual environment also fitted predictions from current theories of vigilance. In particular, subjects overemphasized safety in the early stages of the experiment when learning about predator attack patterns. Strong individual differences in both the frequency and duration of vigilance bouts also emerged in the virtual environment. Such individual differences feature prominently in the vigilance literature in birds and mammals. The virtual environment thus provides a unique tool to assess vigilance patterns in a controlled environment.",,,,guygillesbeauchamp@gmail.com,,"Beauchamp, Guy/0000-0002-3393-9562",,,,67,1,1,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

One established function is to acknowledge existing dominance relationships. At the same time, call rates often increase during social tension, suggesting additional functions, such as to appease higher-ranking individuals, or to maintain spatial proximity and friendly relations. For vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, vocal behaviour has been studied extensively, but little research has been devoted to calls given during encounters between two individuals, i.e. grunts. Here, we examined how individual and relationship features affected the vocal greeting behaviour of wild vervet monkeys in different ecological and social situations. We used an information theory approach to investigate the functional hypotheses of vervet monkeys' vocal greeting signals. We found little support for the main functions proposed in the literature, that is, to signal submission, to avoid conflicts, to test social bonds or to coordinate group activity. Results supported the use of grunts to signal benign intent, and we found that grunts were mostly given to closely bonded males near rivers, suggesting that vervet monkeys use vocal greeting signals to recruit individuals in situations of danger to reduce predation risk.

In response to human disturbance, animals may display a variety of potentially costly behavioural responses, such as vigilance or flight, which were often used as measures of fearfulness and to indicate varying habituation levels. With rapid human development, the globally endangered Scaly-sided Merganser (Mergus squamatus) may be vulnerable to anthropogenic interference. However, human-induced disturbances to a local breeding population have not been quantified. In this study, we tested how flight initiation distance (FID) and behavioural budget (alert time (AT) in particular) changes in relation to human presence in this species in Changbai Mountain, China. The results showed that individuals who experienced greater levels of human disturbance had shorter FIDs, which indicate that the local population may be habituated to human approach.

While HPA/HPI axis inhibition of feeding and reproduction may have evolved as a predator defense, to date there has been no review across taxa of the causal evidence for such a relationship. Here we review the literature on this topic by addressing evidence for three predictions: that exposure to predators decreases reproduction and feeding, that exposure to predators activates the HPA/HPI axis, and that predator-induced activation of the HPA/HPI axis inhibits foraging and reproduction. Weight of evidence indicates that exposure to predator cues inhibits several aspects of foraging and reproduction. While the evidence from fish and mammals supports the hypothesis that predator cues activate the HPA/HPI axis, the existing data in other vertebrate taxa are equivocal. A causal role for the HPA axis in predator-induced suppression of feeding and reproduction has not been demonstrated to date, although many studies report correlative relationships between HPA activity and reproduction and/or feeding. Manipulation of HPA/HPI axis signaling will be required in future studies to demonstrate direct mediation of predator-induced inhibition of feeding and reproduction. Understanding the circuitry linking sensory pathways to their control of the HPA/HPI axis also is needed. Finally, the role that fear and anxiety pathways play in the response of the HPA axis to predator cues is needed to better understand the role that predators have played in shaping anxiety related behaviors in all species, including humans.

Studies recognized that parent defence is dynamic, mainly depending on the threat predators pose. In this context, parental risk management should consider the threat to themselves and to their offspring. Consequently, the observed defence should be a composite of both risk components. Surprisingly, no study so far has determined the influence of these two threat components on parental decision rules. In a field experiment, we investigated parental risk taking in relation to the threat posed to themselves and their offspring. To disentangle the two threat components, we examined defence behaviours of parent blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus towards three different predators and during different nestling developmental stages. Nest defence strategies in terms of alarm call intensity and nearest predator approach differed between the three predators. Defence intensity was only partly explained by threat level. Most importantly, parental risk management varied in relation to their own, but not offspring risk. Parent defence investment was independent of nestling risk when parents followed a high-risk strategy. However, parents considered nestling as well as parental risk when following a low-risk strategy. Our findings could have general implications for the economy of risk management and decision-making strategies in living beings, including humans.","[Mahr, Katharina; Riegler, Georg; Hoi, Herbert] Univ Vet Med, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, A-1160 Vienna, Austria",,"Hoi, H (corresponding author), Univ Vet Med, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria.",herbert.hoi@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,"Sparkling Science Foundation of the Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft und Forschung, Vienna [SPA 03-030]","This research was conducted in collaboration with the Sacre Coeur School in Pressbaum and was financially supported by the Sparkling Science Foundation of the Bundesministerium fur Wissenschaft und Forschung, Vienna (SPA 03-030).",,76,19,19,3,40,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Therefore, we predicted that antipredator behavior, here measured as escape behavior when captured by a human, would correlate with risk of parasite infection at the interspecific level with bolder species having more parasites than risk-averse species. Here we tested whether species with more active escape behavior also tended to have high prevalence of blood parasites, specifically hemosporidian parasites. Focusing on effect sizes we found that escape behavior was intermediately and positively related to prevalence of infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, whereas that was not the case for the more virulent Plasmodium. Species that were habitat generalists and hence encountered a greater diversity of habitats had higher prevalence of blood parasites than specialists. In addition, some components of escape behavior were correlated at an intermediate magnitude with habitat exploration, as reflected by the relative frequency of feeding innovations, and coloniality. We failed to find considerable patterns of correlations between most of the behavioral variables and flight initiation distance, another commonly used antipredator behavior. Therefore, behavioral responses to an approaching predator and to being caught by a human likely represent 2 independent axes of antipredator behavior that do not evolve in concert. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that escape behavior is related to risk of infection with blood parasites partially mediated by the effect of habitat generalism.","[Garcia-Longoria, L.] Univ Extremadura, Dept Anim Biol, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Garamszegi, L.

Because behaviour mediates interactions between an individual and its environment, the ability of organisms to behave appropriately under these new conditions is crucial for determining their immediate success or failure in these modified environments. While hundreds of species are suffering dramatically from these environmental changes, others, such as urbanized and pest species, are doing better than ever. Our goal is to provide insights into explaining such variation. We first summarize the responses of some species to novel situations, including novel risks and resources, habitat loss/fragmentation, pollutants and climate change. Using a sensory ecology approach, we present a mechanistic framework for predicting variation in behavioural responses to environmental change, drawing from models of decision-making processes and an understanding of the selective background against which they evolved. Where immediate behavioural responses are inadequate, learning or evolutionary adaptation may prove useful, although these mechanisms are also constrained by evolutionary history. Although predicting the responses of species to environmental change is difficult, we highlight the need for a better understanding of the role of evolutionary history in shaping individuals' responses to their environment and provide suggestion for future work.","[Sih, Andrew; Ferrari, Maud C.

This prediction has been verified for many risk factors and prey species. The same predictions may apply to other aspects of escape, but testing has been much less extensive. For the lizards Callisaurus draconoides and Sceloporus magister, we tested several such predictions and examined the effect of a previously unstudied risk factor, recent movement by prey. Starting distance (predator-prey distance when approach begins) was unrelated to FID in C. draconoides, as in previously studied ambush foragers. Because movement increases probability of being detected, we predicted that FID would be greater for prey that had moved immediately before being approached than those that had been immobile. FID and distance fled (DF) were longer for lizards that had moved recently. In C. draconoides DF and probability of entering refuge were greater for the second of two approaches, as predicted from greater threat posed by a persistent predator. Callisaurus draconoides had shorter FID and shorter DF, and fewer entered refuge where lizards were habituated than unhabituated to human presence. In S. magister FID increased as distance to refuge increased, FID and DF were longer for fast than slow approaches; probability of fleeing and FID were larger for direct than indirect approach. Effects of these risk factors on FID are consistent across studies, but approach speed has affected DF in only half of studies, perhaps due to constraints by refuge entry and variable distance to refuge. Similarities in effects of risk factors across escape variables, types of predator-prey encounters, and latency to emerge from refuge suggest that similar risk assessment mechanism are used for all variables and settings.","[Cooper, William E., Jr.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ Ft Wayne, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA; [Sherbrooke, Wade C.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Southwestern Res Stn, Portal, AZ 85632 USA",,"Cooper, WE (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ Ft Wayne, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA.",cooperw@ipfw.edu,,,,,,56,14,14,0,39,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,,2013,150,5,,,,,447,469,,10.1163/1568539X-00003061,,,23,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,123DY,WOS:000317369800001,,,,,2022-04-19,

However, how prey adjust behaviour to minimize risk from multiple threats remains unclear. In Central-Western France, we investigated patterns of activity, space and habitat use, and causes of variations during the diel cycle of the grey partridge (captive-reared, released), a farmland bird facing multiple risks (nocturnal predation, diurnal hunting pressure). We also investigated influence of individual space use, relative to risk-related features on the fate of birds. Birds adjusted their behaviours in ways consistent with the reduction of risk from nocturnal carnivores at night and hunters during daytime. We recorded bimodal crepuscular activity, likely explained by commuting movements between spatially-separated diurnal and nocturnal sites composed of different habitats: selection of open terrains and avoidance of predator reservoirs at night vs. use of high-vegetation cover during daytime. We observed space use differences between surviving, hunted and predated birds. Predation and hunting activities act as contrasting pressures, selecting birds based on their spatial behaviour, which has likely shaped diel adjustments at the population level. An improved consideration of temporal variation in environmental pressures would help to reliably address factors constraining populations, so increasing wildlife management efficiency.","[Harmange, Clement; Pays, Olivier] Univ Angers, UMR 6554, CNRS, LETG Angers, 2 Bd Lavoisier, F-49045 Angers, France; [Harmange, Clement; Bretagnolle, Vincent; Chabaud, Nathan] CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; [Harmange, Clement; Bretagnolle, Vincent; Chabaud, Nathan] La Rochelle Univ, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; [Harmange, Clement; Pays, Olivier] Univ Lyon 1, REHABS Int Res Lab, CNRS, Nelson Mandela Univ, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6531 George, South Africa; [Bretagnolle, Vincent] CNRS, LTSER Zone Atelier Plaine & Val de Sevre, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; [Sarasa, Mathieu] BEOPS, 1 Esplanade Compans Caffarelli, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Sarasa, Mathieu] Federat Natl Chasseurs, 13 Rue Gen Leclerc, F-92136 Issy Les Moulineaux, France",,"Harmange, C (corresponding author), Univ Angers, UMR 6554, CNRS, LETG Angers, 2 Bd Lavoisier, F-49045 Angers, France.; Harmange, C (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France.; Harmange, C (corresponding author), La Rochelle Univ, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France.; Harmange, C (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, REHABS Int Res Lab, CNRS, Nelson Mandela Univ, George Campus,Madiba Dr, ZA-6531 George, South Africa.",c.harmange.pro@gmail.com,,"Pays, Olivier/0000-0001-8268-1804; Sarasa, Mathieu/0000-0001-9067-7522",Federation Nationale des Chasseurs [FNC-PSN-PR15-2014],"Special thanks to A.

There is increasing evidence that man-made (anthropogenic) factors can affect the behaviour of a wide range of taxa. However, few experimental studies have investigated how foraging behaviour is affected by exposure to increased noise levels, an issue of growing global concern. In our laboratory study, we examined how exposure to playback of noise originally recorded from ships, a prevalent source of human-generated underwater noise, affects the feeding behaviour of two sympatric fish species: the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus. Both species consumed significantly fewer live Daphnia magna, and showed startle responses significantly more often during playback of additional noise than during control conditions. However, whereas minnows showed a qualitative shift in activity away from foraging behaviour (greater inactivity, more social behaviour) under increased noise conditions, consistent with a classic stress-or fear-related defence cascade, sticklebacks maintained foraging effort but made more mistakes, which may result from an impact of noise on cognition. These findings indicate that additional noise in the environment can lead to reduced food consumption, but that the effects of elevated noise are species specific. It remains to be tested whether these interspecific differences translate into different ultimate impacts, but differential disruptions to foraging may have potential consequences for relative individual fitness and community structure.

This includes potential influences on gene expression mediated via stress-responsive physiological pathways such as the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamus -pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Laboratory studies have documented diverse transcriptional effects of predator-induced fear, but genomic responses to predator exposure in the wild remain poorly understood. Here, we used RNA-sequencing to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome response to chronic predator pressure in a well-studied population of wild yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We assessed the genomic response to this stressor in three ways by (1) identifying differentially expressed individual genes across the genome, (2) assessing whether differentially expressed genes were statistically over-represented by functional categories and (3) testing for transcription factor activity that may mediate observed gene expression differences. We found 349 individual genes regulated in association with chronic predator presence, including transcripts known to regulate heat shock proteins, metabolism and DNA damage repair. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the majority of these differentially expressed genes were involved with the cellular response to stress, cellular metabolism and protein transport. Transcription factor analysis implicated glucocorticoid signalling in mediating these effects. Our work confirms that the physiological response to predator-induced stress is complex, initiating transcriptional activity in multiple processes and pathways. In addition to the canonical expectations that individuals exposed to predators mobilize HPA signalling and homeostasis pathways, we also detected activity in genes typically associated with human anxiety and cerebral function. This is the first study to demonstrate that leukocyte transcriptomes taken from animals living in a natural environment can reflect the complex ecology of fear.

Organismal and environmental characteristics can, in some species, influence predation risk associated with thermoregulation and thereby relax or tighten constraints on thermoregulatory behavior, physiological performance, and, ultimately, life history traits. Providing one of the first such investigations in turtles, we examine whether behavior and thermal environment modulate a thermoregulation-predation risk trade-off in juvenile gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus). Young gopher tortoises experience very high predation pressure, and their declining species faces many challenges, including human-induced increased shading of its environment. We hypothesized that in response to simulated predator approach, basking hatchling and juvenile tortoises would: (i) hide inside burrows; (ii) hide for shorter durations in cooler burrows presumably due to greater constraints on physiological performance; and (iii) spend greater time at the surface following disturbance in cool environments because individuals would need to bask more to maintain preferred body temperatures. Basking tortoises always hid inside burrows when approached and exhibited very long flight initiation distances ((x) over bar =45m) that increased with age/size. Individuals fled into burrows even when it was not possible for them to see the approaching researcher, suggesting the use of vibrations (aerial/ground) to detect potential predators and a possible antipredator function for exceptionally large otoliths characteristic of the species. Tortoises hid for short durations ((x) over bar =18.3min), especially in cool burrows, suggesting that they optimize hiding responses to balance physiological costs and antipredator benefits. Additionally, surface activity following disturbance consisted primarily of basking and correlated negatively with burrow temperature. These findings suggest that thermal environment influences predation risk in ectotherms whose surface activity is driven primarily by thermoregulatory requirements and highlight potential benefits of warm, well-insolated habitats, such as endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems, for juvenile gopher tortoises.","[Radzio, Thomas A.; O'Connor, Michael P.] Drexel Univ, Dept Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [O'Connor, Michael P.] Drexel Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Radzio, TA (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Biodivers Earth & Environm Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",tomradzio@hotmail.com,,"Radzio, Thomas/0000-0002-5732-7798","McLean Fellowship in Ornithology and Environmental Science from the Department of Biodiversity, Earth, and Environmental Science at Drexel University; Wade Tract Research Endowment; Chicago Herpetological Society; Minnesota Herpetological Society; Western Digital Foundation; Biology Department at Drexel University; National Aeronautical and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Betz Chair Endowment in Environmental Science at Drexel University; United States Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory","McLean Fellowship in Ornithology and Environmental Science from the Department of Biodiversity, Earth, and Environmental Science at Drexel University; Wade Tract Research Endowment; Chicago Herpetological Society; Minnesota Herpetological Society; Western Digital Foundation; Biology Department at Drexel University; National Aeronautical and Space Administration; Betz Chair Endowment in Environmental Science at Drexel University; United States Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory",,60,5,5,3,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,DEC,2017,123,12,,,,,957,965,,10.1111/eth.12695,,,9,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,FM2YC,WOS:000414867800009,,,,,2022-04-19,

While many species are limited to seeking safety under cover or under ground, some birds can fly away from their predators and escape to trees. If birds in fact 'feel' safer (e.g. perceive less risk) in trees, we would expect them to tolerate closer approach by a potential terrestrial predator. Another component of safety is at which point the animal detects an approaching threat, which we expected to increase with eye size, assuming eye size is a surrogate for visual acuity. We used the distance birds moved away from an approaching human [flight initiation distance (FID)] as a metric to determine whether birds associated a lower risk of predation by being in trees, and we used the distance at which birds first displayed alert behaviors from an approaching human (alert distance) to determine if birds with larger eyes had higher detection distances. Although some species were affected by tree height, we found no clear pattern that birds assessed themselves to be at a lower risk of predation when they were greater than or equal to3 m above the ground compared with being <3 m above ground. In the 10 species for which height had any significant effect on FID, birds greater than or equal to3 m off the ground had greater FIDs in six species, but the remaining three species had the opposite response. While we found a significant positive relationship between eye size and alert distance in 23 species, the relationship was not present in a phylogenetic analysis using independent contrasts, which suggests that the apparent relationship was influenced strongly by the association between the studied species. Together, these results suggest that birds do not obviously associate being in a tree with safety, and that variations in visual acuity, per se, cannot be used as a general indicator of differences in alert distances, as previously suggested in the literature.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Organ Biol Ecol & Evolut, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO USA; Grp Ecol Aplicada, Madrid, Spain",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Organ Biol Ecol & Evolut, 621 Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244",,,,34,58,61,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,APR,2004,110,4,,,,,273,285,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2004.00970.x,,,13,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,814MK,WOS:000220978600002,,,,,2022-04-19,

In the past 4years, global progress in this field has been made due to a remarkable number of synthetic reviews, meta-analyses, and comparative analyses that are based on databases containing tens of thousands of observations on how birds escape from predators. In addition, novel empirical studies, often on more than one species at a time, have provided new insights into mechanistic diversity. Birds fly, walk, and swim away from approaching threats and the distance at which they do soquantified as flight initiation distancereveals much about their perceptions of predation risk. The contexts that influence risk assessment and management in both ecological and evolutionary time have largely been identified by thorough study of the life history, natural history, physiology, environment, and phylogenies of birds. We have also discovered continental and latitudinal differences in risk management. A large set of applied studies now use this knowledge to both increase our understanding of the vulnerability of birds to anthropogenic disturbance, and provide insight into how best to manage it. Future advances require: (1) developing a better understanding of the sensory mechanisms involved in risk assessment, (2) studies of individuals that are sampled repeatedly, and (3) the development of decision-support tools for wildlife managers to help us better coexist with birds in an increasingly urban world.","[Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,"Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244",,,,35,8,10,3,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Areas previously inaccessible are now being visited by ever-growing numbers of people, which increases human-wildlife encounters across habitats. This has raised concern among researchers and conservationists as, even in non-aggressive encounters, animals often perceive humans as predators and mount physiological and behavioural responses that can have negative consequences. However, despite all the research in recent decades, not many general patterns have emerged, especially at the level of populations, and many studies have yielded seemingly contradictory or inconclusive results. We argue that this is partly due to incomplete knowledge of the number and complexity of factors that may modulate the responses of animals. Thus, we aim to provide a conceptual approach intended to highlight the reasons that make it difficult to detect general patterns. We present a comprehensive compilation of factors modulating animal responses to humans at increasing levels (from sensory detection and immediate behavioural and physiological reactions, to changes in fitness and population trends), which may help understanding the uncertainty in the patterns. We observed that there are many modulating factors, which can be categorized as reflecting characteristics of the recreational activity itself (e.g. intensity of human presence), of the animals concerned (e.g. age or antipredatory strategy), and of the spatio-temporal context (e.g. habitat or timing of the encounter). Some factors appear to have non-linear and complex effects, which, if not considered, may lead to erroneous conclusions. Finally, we conclude that the difficulty in finding general patterns will be amplified at higher levels (i.e. at the level of populations), since as we proceed from one level to the next, the number of potential modulating factors accumulates, adding noise and obscuring direct associations between recreation and wildlife. More comprehensive knowledge about which (and how) factors affect animal responses across levels will certainly improve future research design and interpretation, and thus, our understanding of human recreational impacts on wildlife.","[Tablado, Zulima; Jenni, Lukas] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Seerose 1, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland",,"Tablado, Z (corresponding author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Seerose 1, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland.",Zulima.Tablado@vogelwarte.ch,"Tablado, Zulima/AAN-7484-2020",,,,,261,60,63,4,115,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

We conducted experimental human approaches with different simulated threat levels toward solitary adult male Thomson's gazelles, that were located in open grassland. We measured individuals flight initiation distance (FID), distance fled, escape speed, and the distance between the location where the focal individual had stopped to flee and where the human stopped the approach (termed safety distance). Multivariate analyses revealed an overall significant effect of starting distance, alertness, and time of day, but no statistical effect was found for approach speed on the multivariate response. The individual responses showed a significant positive effect of starting distance on both FID and safety distance. We also found a novel unimodal effect of time on FID. Finally, alertness and approach speed only had a significant effect on safety distance, where faster approaches and individuals that displayed alert behavior had shorter safety distances. Together, these findings indicate support for the flush early and avoid the rush hypothesis, shows the necessity of using starting distance, alertness, and time as covariates when testing the effects of threat level, and demonstrate the usefulness of the new metric safety distance.","[Holmern, Tomas; Setsaas, Trine Hay; Roskaft, Eivin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Hogskoleringen 5, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Holmern, Tomas] Norwegian Environm Agcy, POB 5672, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Melis, Claudia] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Biol, Hogskoleringen 5, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Tufto, Jarle] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Math Sci, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",,"Holmern, T (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Hogskoleringen 5, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.; Holmern, T (corresponding author), Norwegian Environm Agcy, POB 5672, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",tholmern@yahoo.com,"Melis, Claudia/Y-3538-2019; Melis, Claudia/B-5411-2009; Melis, Claudia/AAK-9267-2020; Røskaft, Eivin/N-7476-2019","Melis, Claudia/0000-0001-8315-9129; Røskaft, Eivin/0000-0003-0262-8443; Setsaas, Trine Hay/0000-0002-2377-3183",Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [RCN: 140865/720],This work was supported by a Norwegian Research Council grant (RCN: 140865/720 to E.R.),,67,7,8,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

However, a recent hypothesis, Flush Early and Avoid the Rush (FEAR), acknowledged that the cost of monitoring approaching predators might be a ubiquitous cost. The FEAR hypothesis predicts that prey will generally flee soon after they detect a predator so as to minimize the costs incurred by monitoring the predator. Knowing whether animals flee to reduce monitoring costs is of applied interest because wildlife managers use escape behavior to create set-back zones to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Here we provide the most comprehensive assessment of the FEAR hypothesis using data collected from 178 bird species representing 67 families from two continents. The FEAR hypothesis explains escape behavior in 79% of studied species. Because the FEAR hypothesis is a widespread phenomenon that drives escape behavior in birds, alert distance must be systematically incorporated into the design of set-back zones to protect vulnerable species.","[Samia, Diogo S.

A group size effect on vigilance is seldom seen in primates, perhaps because scanning and feeding often occur simultaneously or because the distinction between routine and induced vigilance has not been investigated. We analyzed feeding and resting observations separately while distinguishing between routine and induced scans in four groups of wild ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus) experiencing scramble competition for food and infanticide risk. We used linear mixed-effect models to test the effect of group size, age-sex class, number of neighbors, number of adult male neighbors, and height in the canopy on scanning rates (vigilance) with and without evident conspecific threat. Food type was also examined in the feeding models. Perceived predation risk affected vigilance more than scramble competition for food and infanticide risk. Routine and induced vigilance were greatest at lower canopy heights during feeding and resting and increased when individuals had fewer neighbors while resting. A group size effect was found on induced vigilance while resting, but scanning increased with group size, which probably indicates visual monitoring of conspecifics. Scanning rates decreased while feeding on foods that required extensive manipulation. This supports the idea that vigilance is relatively cost free for upright feeders when eating food that requires little manipulation, a common feature of folivore diets. In the presence of threatening conspecific males, close proximity to resident males decreased individual vigilance, demonstrating the defensive role of these males in the group.","[Teichroeb, Julie A.; Sicotte, Pascale] Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",,"Teichroeb, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jateichr@ucalgary.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of Calgary; Province of Alberta,"We thank the Ghana Wildlife Division and the management committee of the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey for permission to conduct this research.

Human activities have added considerable noise to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and there is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise affects communication and movement patterns in a variety of species. However, there has been relatively little work considering the effect on behaviours that are fundamental to survival, and thus have direct fitness consequences. We conducted a series of controlled tank-based experiments to consider how playback of ship noise, the most common source of underwater noise, affects foraging and antipredator behaviour in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. Ship noise playback was more likely than ambient-noise playback to disrupt feeding, although crabs experiencing the two sound treatments did not differ in their likelihood of, or speed at, finding a food source in the first place. While crabs exposed to ship noise playback were just as likely as ambient-noise controls to detect and respond to a simulated predatory attack, they were slower to retreat to shelter. Ship noise playback also resulted in crabs that had been turned on their backs righting themselves faster than those experiencing ambient-noise playback; remaining immobile may reduce the likelihood of further predatory attention. Our findings therefore suggest that anthropogenic noise has the potential to increase the risks of starvation and predation, and showcases that the behaviour of invertebrates, and not just vertebrates, is susceptible to the impact of this pervasive global pollutant.

Ad libitum human-provided foods may provide the perception that urban habitats are food-rich even as natural food availability decreases. Similarly, human activity may increase the perception that predation risk is high even as natural predators may decrease in abundance. In response, birds may reduce parental care with a subsequent cost to successful reproduction. Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in suburban areas have lower nest success during the nestling period than do wildland jays, possibly the result of such maladaptive responses, but maybe because of ecological differences with wildlands. We manipulated adult perception of predation risk and the availability of nestling foods in suburban and wildland areas to determine if these factors influenced parental care and nestling begging, and if the behavioral responses of adults influence nest survival during the nestling stage. Experimentally increasing perception of predation risk reduced parental care by both suburban and wildland females, but did not influence care by males. Increasing food availability, but not predation risk, had little influence on parental care, but resulted in decreased nestling begging rates and an increase in the frequency (pitch) of begging calls in both habitats. However, neither parental care nor food availability influenced nest survival during the nestling stage. Instead, the presence of helpers was the most important variable in nest survival analyses, suggesting that habitat-specific differences in nest survival during the nestling stage were not simply the result of maladaptive parental behavior or shortage of nestling food resources in the suburban habitat. The lack of helpers combined with ecological differences, such as the abundance of nest predators, may be why fewer nests of Florida Scrub-Jays survive during this stage in suburban areas.","[Niederhauser, Joseph M.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Bowman, Reed] Archbold Biol Stn, Venus, FL 33960 USA",,"Niederhauser, JM (corresponding author), 3056 New Bern Cove, Oviedo, FL 32765 USA.",jmniederhauser@hotmail.com,"Niederhauser, Joseph/Z-5031-2019",,American Ornithologists' Union,"We thank A.

However, the study of particular features of these situations suggests the existence of prototypical emotional reactions and associated defensive behaviors. Since all living beings are subjected to common evolutionary pressures, such as predation and conspecific competition, it is plausible that there is conservation of some basic defensive responses in their behavioral repertoire. The choice for approaching or withdrawing from a given situation depends, among others things, on environmental features, including the threat intensity and the distance from the source of the threat. If these basic responses were conserved in humans, they should be expressed in ways similar to those observed in non-human animals. Due to ethical reasons and easy application, mental imagery has been used to test this hypothesis. The studies included in this review point to the validity of this method, with both self-report and neurophysiological findings corroborating the hypothesis under scrutiny. Despite the need for additional investigation to deal with some limitations, the information obtained with this method can help to a better understanding of the conditions that provoke specific defensive behaviors and related emotions. This knowledge may also contribute to identify vulnerability factors for fear/anxiety-related disorders.","[Shuhama, Rosana; Del-Ben, Cristina Marta] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Neurosci & Behav, Ave Bandeirantes,3900, BR-1404890 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Blanchard, D.

These changes, including increased human-wildlife interactions, may exert sublethal impacts on wildlife such as alterations in stress physiology and qbehavior. California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) occur in human-modified as well as more pristine environments, where they face a variety of anthropogenic and naturally occurring threats. This makes this species a valuable model for examining the effects of diverse challenges on the physiology and behavior of free-living mammals. To explore potential sublethal effects of habitat modification on O. beecheyi, we compared body masses, behaviors, and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels for free-living squirrels in human-disturbed versus undisturbed habitats. Prior to these analyses, we validated the use of FGMs in this species by exposing captive O. beecheyi to pharmacological and handling challenges; both challenges produced significant increases in FGMs in the study animals. While FGM responses were repeatable within captive individuals, responses by free-living animals were more variable, perhaps reflecting a greater range of life-history traits and environmental conditions within natural populations of squirrels. Animals from our human-disturbed study site had significantly higher FGMs, significantly lower body masses, and were significantly less behaviorally reactive to humans than those from our more pristine study site. Thus, despite frequent exposure of California ground squirrels to human impacts, anthropogenic stressors appear to influence stress physiology and other phenotypic traits in this species. These findings suggest that even human-tolerant mammalian species may experience important sublethal consequences due to human modifications of natural habitats.","[Hammond, Talisin T.] San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA; [Hammond, Talisin T.; Lacey, Eileen A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, 3101 Valley Life Sci Bldg, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Vo, Minnie; Burton, Clara T.; Surber, Lisa L.; Smith, Jennifer E.] Mills Coll, Biol Dept, 5000 MacArthur Blvd, Oakland, CA 94613 USA",,"Smith, JE (corresponding author), Mills Coll, Biol Dept, 5000 MacArthur Blvd, Oakland, CA 94613 USA.",jesmith@mills.edu,,,"NSF graduate research fellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Jill Barrett Biology Research and Undergraduate Research Opportunity Fellowships from Mills College; Undergraduate Education Program of the W.

In humans, this persistent nociceptive sensitization is often accompanied by heightened sensations of pain and anxiety [2]. While experimental [3] and clinical [4] evidence support the adaptive value of immediate nociception during injury, no direct evidence exists for adaptive benefits of long-lasting sensitization after injury. Recently, we showed that minor injury produces long-term sensitization of behavioral and neuronal responses in squid, Doryteuthis pealei [5, 6]. Here we tested the adaptive value of this sensitization during encounters between squid and a natural fish predator. Locomotion and other spontaneous behaviors of squid that received distal injury to a single arm (with or without transient anesthesia) showed no measurable impairment 6 hr after the injury. However, black sea bass given access to freely swimming squid oriented toward and pursued injured squid at greater distances than uninjured squid, regardless of previous anesthetic treatment. Once targeted, injured squid began defensive behavioral sequences [7, 8] earlier than uninjured squid. This effect was blocked by brief anesthetic treatment that prevented development of nociceptive sensitization [6, 9]. Importantly, the early anesthetic treatment also reduced the subsequent escape and survival of injured, but not uninjured, squid. Thus, while minor injury increases the risk of predatory attack, it also triggers a sensitized state that promotes enhanced responsiveness to threats, increasing the survival (Darwinian fitness) of injured animals during subsequent predatory encounters.","[Crook, Robyn J.; Walters, Edgar T.] Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Integrat Biol & Pharmacol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Dickson, Katharine] George Mason Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Hanlon, Roger T.] Marine Biol Lab, Program Sensory Physiol & Behav, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",,"Crook, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Houston, Sch Med, Dept Integrat Biol & Pharmacol, 6431 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",robyn.crook@uth.tmc.edu; edgar.t.walters@uth.tmc.edu,"Hanlon, Roger T/Q-8687-2016","Hanlon, Roger T/0000-0003-0004-5674; Crook, Robyn/0000-0002-4079-7996; Walters, Edgar/0000-0003-0718-102X; Dickson, Katharine/0000-0002-3229-0044","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1146987, IOS-1145478]",We thank members of the R.T.H. laboratory and Michelle Staudinger for advice on experimental design and fish behavior.

Studies that assess trade-offs between migratory strategies typically compare the amount of predation risk and forage resources migrants and residents are exposed to only while on separate ranges and assume both groups intermix completely while on sympatric ranges. Here we provide one of the first tests of this assumption by comparing the amount of overlap between home ranges of GPS-collared migrant and resident elk and fine-scale exposure to wolf predation risk and forage biomass at telemetry locations on a sympatric winter range in west-central Alberta, Canada. Overlap between migrant and resident home ranges increased throughout the winter, and both groups were generally intermixed and exposed to equal forage biomass. During the day, both migrants and residents avoided predation risk by remaining in areas far from timber with high human activity, which wolves avoided. However, at night wolves moved onto the grasslands close to humans and away from timber. Resident elk were consistently closer to areas of human activity and further from timber than migrants, possibly because of a habituation to humans. As a result, resident elk were exposed to higher night-time predation risk than migrants. Our study does not support the assumption that migrant and resident elk are exposed to equal predation risk on their sympatric range when human presence alters predation risk dynamics and habituation to humans is unequal between migratory strategies.","[Robinson, Barry G.; Hebblewhite, Mark; Merrill, Evelyn H.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada",,"Robinson, BG (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",bgrobins@ualberta.ca,"hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013; Hebblewhite, Mark/AAI-8101-2020; Robinson, Barry/O-4406-2014; Merrill, Evelyn/N-5801-2015","Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361; Robinson, Barry/0000-0002-2646-2508; Merrill, Evelyn/0000-0001-7737-958X",Alberta Conservation Association; Alberta Cooperative Conservation Research Unit; Alberta Enhanced Career Development; Alberta Sustainable Resource Development; Canon National Parks; Center for Mathematical Biology; Challenge Grants in Biodiversity; Foothills Model Forest; Foundation for North American Wild Sheep; Marmot; Mountain Equipment Co-op Environment Fund; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council CRO [261091-02]; Parks Canada; Patagonia; Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation; Sundre Forest Products Limited; Weyerhauser Inc.; University of AlbertaUniversity of Alberta,"The project was funded by the Alberta Conservation Association, Alberta Cooperative Conservation Research Unit, Alberta Enhanced Career Development, Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, the Canon National Parks Science Scholarship for the Americas (MH), Center for Mathematical Biology, Challenge Grants in Biodiversity, Foothills Model Forest, Foundation for North American Wild Sheep, Marmot, Mountain Equipment Co-op Environment Fund, National Sciences and Engineering Research Council CRO grant no. 261091-02, Parks Canada, Patagonia, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Sundre Forest Products Limited, Weyerhauser Inc., and the University of Alberta.

We also examined diel and tidal variability in prey densities and tested whether people and dogs cause temporary displacement or reductions in foraging rates.

Animals can adapt to human proximity through habituation or microevolution, and island, domesticated and urbanized animals have all reduced their threshold of fear compared to controls. We tested whether a common cause of threat status is susceptibility to human proximity. We did so by estimating whether 48 pairs of closely related bird species differing in their threat status consistently had longer flight initiation distances (FID, the distance at which the individual takes flight from an approaching human) in the more threatened species. We estimated threat status by relying on existing categorization of threat status by the European Union. Threatened species had consistently longer FID than their closely related species in both parametric and nonparametric tests. Common species were indeed more often recorded during field work while recording FID than were threatened species, the difference being almost 2-fold.

Here, in three experiments, we built on previous interactive tasks to create an online foraging game for studying divided attention in human participants exposed to the (simulated) risk of predation. Participants used a sheep icon to collect items from different target categories randomly distributed across the display. Each trial also contained wolf objects, whose movement was inspired by classic studies of multiple object tracking. When participants needed to physically avoid the wolves, foraging patterns changed, with an increased tendency to switch between target categories and a decreased ability to prioritise high reward targets, relative to participants who could safely ignore them. However, when the wolves became dangerous by periodically changing form (briefly having big eyes) instead of by approaching the sheep, foraging patterns were unaffected. Spatial disruption caused by the need to rapidly shift position-rather the cost of reallocating attention-therefore appears to influence foraging in this context. These results thus confirm that participants can efficiently alternate between target selection and tracking moving objects, replicating earlier single-target search findings. Future studies may need to increase the perceived risk or potential costs associated with simulated danger, in order to elicit the extended run behaviour predicted by animal models of foraging, but absent in the current data.","[Thornton, Ian M.] Univ Malta, Fac Media & Knowledge Sci, Dept Cognit Sci, Msida, Malta; [Tagu, Jerome; Kristjansson, Arni] Univ Iceland, Fac Psychol, Sch Hlth Sci, Oddi V Sturlugotu,101, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Tagu, Jerome] Univ Bordeaux, EA 4139, Lab Psychol, Bordeaux, France; [Zdravkovic, Suncica] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Philosophy, Dept Psychol, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Zdravkovic, Suncica] Univ Belgrade, Lab Expt Psychol, Belgrade, Serbia; [Kristjansson, Arni] Natl Res Univ, Sch Psychol, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",,"Thornton, IM (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Fac Media & Knowledge Sci, Dept Cognit Sci, Msida, Malta.",ian.thornton@um.edu.mt,"Tagu, Jérôme/N-7665-2019","Tagu, Jérôme/0000-0003-2331-7433; Thornton, Ian/0000-0001-6328-3536; Kristjansson, Arni/0000-0003-4168-4886","Academic Work Resource Fund of the University of Malta; University Research Fund of the University of Malta; Icelandic Research Fund [206744-051, 152427]; Research Fund of the University of IcelandIstanbul University",IMT's research is supported by the Academic Work Resource Fund and the University Research Fund of the University of Malta.

Because wildlife often perceive humans as predators, this increase in human disturbance may have negative consequences for the individuals and also for the viability of populations. Up to now, experiments on the effects of human disturbance on wildlife have mainly focused on individual behavioral and stress-physiological reactions, on breeding success, and on survival. However, the effects on other physiological parameters and trans-generational effects remain poorly understood. We used a low-intensity experimental disturbance in the field to explore the impacts of human disturbance on telomere length in great tit (Parus major) populations and found a clear effect of disturbance on telomere length. Adult males, but not females, in disturbed plots showed shorter telomere lengths when compared to control plot. Moreover, variation in telomere length of adult great tits was reflected in the next generation, as we found a positive correlation between telomere length of the chicks and of their fathers. Given that telomere length has been linked to animal lifespan, our study highlights that activities considered to be of little concern (i.e., low levels of disturbance) can have a long-lasting impact on the physiology and survival of wild animals and their next generation.","[Tablado, Zulima; Botsch, Yves; Jenni-Eiermann, Susanne; Jenni, Lukas] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland; [Botsch, Yves] Michael Otto Inst NABU, Bergenhusen, Germany; [Massemin, Sylvie; Zahn, Sandrine] Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, Dept Ecol Physiol & Ethol, Strasbourg, France",,"Tablado, Z (corresponding author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Sempach, Switzerland.",zutal@yahoo.es,,,Observatoire des Sciences de lUnivers Terre Homme Environnement Temps Astronomie (OSU THETA Bourgogne-Franche Comte),"First of all we thank all the collaborators in the field which did the hard disturbance-work in the forest (in alphabetical order): C.

Anthropogenic noise, a ubiquitous form of human disturbance, has the potential to influence antipredator behaviour through its effects on predator detection and perceived risk. Noise might increase perceived risk as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis, reduce risk by providing protection from disturbance-sensitive predators, or have no effect on antipredator behaviour if animals are tolerant of nonlethal forms of human disturbance. Road traffic is a pervasive source of anthropogenic noise, but few studies have experimentally isolated the effects of road noise on behaviour. Using systematic playback experiments, we investigated the influence of traffic noise on foraging and vigilance in a keystone species in North American prairie systems, the prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus. Exposure to road traffic noise significantly lowered aboveground activity, reduced foraging and increased vigilance, as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis. These effects were prevalent irrespective of temperature, a strong influence on such behaviours, and they were consistent across the 3-month study period, providing no evidence of habituation. Our results provide the first experimental investigation of the potential costs of this ubiquitous disturbance in a free-ranging mammal, demonstrating that road noise can alter key survival behaviours of this ecologically pivotal species. These findings highlight that the presence of animals in a location is no guarantee of population and ecological integrity, while also underlining the potential synergistic impacts of noise on a species that has already experienced severe declines across its historic range due to human disturbance. Globally, roadways have profound impacts on biodiversity, and quantifying the behavioural and fitness costs associated with different forms of disturbance such as noise is crucial for mitigation.

Carnivores fascinate society, yet these animals pose threats to people living near them, resulting in high rates of carnivore death near human settlements. We used 41 y of demographic data for more than 2,500 brown bears-one of the world's most widely distributed and conflict-prone carnivores-to understand the behavioral and demographic mechanisms promoting carnivore coexistence in human-dominated landscapes. Bear mortality was high and unsustainable near people, but a human-induced shift to nocturnality facilitated lower risks of bear mortality and rates of conflict with people. Despite these behavioral shifts, projected population growth rates for bears in human-dominated areas revealed a source-sink dynamic. Despite some female bears successfully reproducing in the sink areas, bear persistence was reliant on a supply of immigrants from areas with minimal human influence (i.e., wilderness). Such mechanisms of coexistence reveal a striking paradox: Connectivity to wilderness areas supplies bears that likely will die from people, but these bears are essential to avert local extirpation. These insights suggest carnivores contribute to human-carnivore coexistence through behavioral and demographic mechanisms, and that connected wilderness is critical to sustain coexistence landscapes.","[Lamb, Clayton T.; Nielsen, Scott E.; Boutin, Stan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T63 2RG, Canada; [Lamb, Clayton T.; Ford, Adam T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [McLellan, Bruce N.] Int Union Conservat Nat Bear Specialist Grp, Darcy, BC V0N 1L0, Canada; [Proctor, Michael F.] Int Union Conservat Nat Bear Specialist Grp, Kaslo, BC V0G 1M0, Canada; [Mowat, Garth] Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resource Operat & Rura, Nelson, BC V1L 4K3, Canada; [Mowat, Garth] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Environm & Geog Sci, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Ciarniello, Lana] Int Union Conservat Nat Human Bear Conflicts Expe, Campbell River, BC V9H 1N3, Canada",,"Lamb, CT (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T63 2RG, Canada.; Lamb, CT (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",ctlamb@ualberta.ca,"Nielsen, Scott/C-2842-2013","Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Lamb, Clayton/0000-0002-1961-0509","Government of British Columbia; Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship; Liber Ero Fellowship Program; Canada Research Chairs programCanada Research Chairs; National Science Engineering and Research Council; Wildlife Conservation Society; British Columbia Conservation Foundation; Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program; Forest Enhancement Society of British Columbia; Teck Coal; Columbia Basin Trust; Okanagan Nation Alliance; Ktunaxa Nation; Margo Supplies; Counter Assault; Wildsight; Nature Conservancy of Canada; Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative; Safari Club International; Sparwood and District Fish and Wildlife Association; Elkford Rod and Gun Club; Grizzly Bear Foundation; Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, Outdoor Research; British Columbia Conservation Officer Service","The data in this paper were augmented by generous data sharing from the British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations, Clayton Apps, Grant MacHutchon, Francis Iredale, Stefan Himmer, Tony Hamilton, Deb Wellwood, Karen Diemart, and Michelle McLellan.

We measured how wild brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) responded to odors of mammalian, avian, and snake predators as well as nonpredator controls. The first experiment took place under controlled conditions in a laboratory where we recorded the occurrence of four behavioral categories (ignore, curiosity, alert, and fear) in response to a single odor. Subjects exhibited behavioral change significantly more often in response to the predator than to control stimuli, but did not distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar predators. Mammalian predator urine and feces were most likely to elicit behavioral change. The owl was the only predator to never elicit behavioral change, possibly because owls do not provide relevant odor cues. A second experiment employing live traps in the forest found that neither predator nor control odors affected the likelihood of capture. Due to their longevity, odors do not provide accurate information of spatial and temporal risk, and while mouse lemurs may have initially hesitated to enter a trap, in the absence of additional information about risk, they may have eventually ignored the stimuli. This study found that brown mouse lemurs are able to distinguish between predator and nonpredator odors, and that risk assessment may be affected by the experience, as well as predator and sensory stimulus quality.","[Deppe, Anja M.] Ctr ValBio, Ranomafana, Madagascar; [Kushnick, Geoff] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Arts & Social Sci, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Human Behav Ecol Res Grp, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"Deppe, AM (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",deppeam@gmail.com,,"Kushnick, Geoff/0000-0001-9280-0213; Deppe, Anja/0000-0003-4783-4320","Primate Conservation Inc.; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0721233, 0726166]; Stony Brook University; Conservation International; Primate Action Fund; Idea Wild","Idea Wild; Primate Conservation Inc.; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: 0721233, 0726166; Stony Brook University, Grant/Award Number: Graduate student grant; Conservation International, Primate Action Fund",,71,2,2,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-2565,1098-2345,,AM J PRIMATOL,Am.

Although drive hunts are spatially and temporally well defined, the scale at which the hunting risk triggers anti-predator responses of prey remains poorly documented. The present study aims at 1) characterizing the delayed movement responses of female red deer Cervus elaphus to hunters and 2) understanding the main environmental determinants modulating these post-disturbance responses at the individual level. We hypothesized that red deer alter their movement behaviour for several days after a drive hunt by increasing their speed and exploring more space. Then, we predicted that individuals close to the hunting area would exhibit stronger responses (i.e. higher speed and larger home range size) than individuals located further away. We also expected topographic obstacles and vegetation cover to reduce the magnitude of the post-disturbance responses. We used GPS data from a large dataset collected on 91 female red deer in the National Hunting and Wildlife Reserve of La Petite Pierre (France), between 2004 and 2018. Each year, drive hunts are conducted by about 43 hunters and 6 dogs, once a week from October to February. Our results suggest that, over a 72-h period after a drive hunt, female red deer could show two contrasting strategies: 1) flight-type movements (i.e. higher maximum speed) associated with more space explored due to a temporary avoidance of the disturbed area and 2) lower movements to avoid detection and contacts with hunters. These two delayed responses are situation-specific, depending on risk proximity, landscape features, hunting conditions and individual characteristics. This study highlights that ungulate management using a 'hunting for fear' approach may be adjusted considering spatial and temporal scales of the effects of drive hunts on red deer movement patterns.","[Chassagneux, Agathe; Siat, Vivien; Baubet, Eric; Said, Sonia] Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, DRE Unite Ongules Sauvages, FR-01330 Birieux, France; [Calenge, Clement] Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, DRE Cellule Appui Methodol, St Benoist, Le Perray En Yv, France; [Mortz, Philippe] Agence Terr Nord Alsace, Off Natl Forets, Saverne, France",,"Chassagneux, A (corresponding author), Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, DRE Unite Ongules Sauvages, FR-01330 Birieux, France.",agathe.chassagneux@gmail.com,"Calenge, Clément/AAK-4846-2021","Calenge, Clément/0000-0001-7741-8016",French National Hunting and Wildlife Agency (Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage),This study was financially supported by the French National Hunting and Wildlife Agency (Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage).,,49,6,6,3,9,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,,2019,,,,,,,,,wlb.00545,10.2981/wlb.00545,,,10,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,HZ9QR,WOS:000469192500001,,gold,,,2022-04-19,

During host infection, they secrete secondary metabolites such as destruxin A. Information on the fate of those secondary metabolites in the food chain and their risk to human and animal health is scarce. In the present work, predator-prey bioassays were performed to evaluate the behavior and survival of green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) larvae when presented with armyworm Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae treated with Metarhizium brunneum BIPESCO5 and EAMa 01/58-Su strains. Moreover, ecotoxicological studies were done using HPLC-MS to monitor the fate of destruxin A in the prey-predator system. HPLC-MS confirmed the presence of destruxin A at low concentrations in S. littoralis larvae infected with BIPESCO5 (approximately 0.014 mu g/g) and EAMa 01/58-Su (approx 0.031 mu g/g) strains, whereas the metabolite was not detected in C. carnea larvae consuming M. brunneum-treated S. littoralis larvae. Furthermore, C. carnea larvae preferentially fed on healthy prey versus M. brunneum-treated prey as revealed by both the higher predator ratio feeding on S. littoralis control larvae and the higher per capita number of control larvae consumed by the predator compared to M. brunneum-treated larvae. Moreover, this preference was inversely related to the post-inoculation period of S. littoralis larvae treated with M. brunneum. Furthermore, C. carnea larvae fed on healthy prey gained more weight than those fed on treated individuals. Both M. brunneum treatments used against S. littoralis larvae may be considered low risk to C. carnea due to the lack of fungus-related mortality in the predator and the lack of movement of destruxin A from the prey to the predator. However, further studies on other nontargets and with more strains of M. brunneum are needed to evaluate their possible simultaneous use in integrated pest management.","[Rios-Moreno, A.; Quesada-Moraga, E.; Garrido-Jurado, I.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Agr & Forestry Sci, ETSIAM, C4Bldg,Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",,"Quesada-Moraga, E (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Agr & Forestry Sci, ETSIAM, C4Bldg,Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",equesada@uco.es,"QUESADA-MORAGA, ENRIQUE/K-3419-2014; Garrido-Jurado, Inmaculada/K-6466-2014","QUESADA-MORAGA, ENRIQUE/0000-0003-4021-3900; Garrido-Jurado, Inmaculada/0000-0002-2178-0013","European CommunityEuropean Commission [FP7-ENV.2011.3.1.9-1 ECO-INNOVATION, 282767]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain [AGL 2016-80483-R]","A grant from the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7-ENV.2011.3.1.9-1 ECO-INNOVATION, INBIOSOIL, Grant Agreement No. 282767) and a grant from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain, Project AGL 2016-80483-R, supported this research.",,55,10,10,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

The present study evaluated the effects of cocaine administration upon defensive responses of mice to a predator (rat) in a Mouse Defense Test Battery (MDTB) that permits the display of the full range of the mouse defensive behaviors: avoidance/escape, night, freezing, defensive upright, and defensive threat and attack. Mice were tested 30 min following intraperitoneal (IP) injections of either 0, 10, 20, or 30 mg/kg cocaine hydrochloride suspended in physiological saline. Cocaine produced an increase in flight and escape responses throughout the subtests comprising the MDTB. The percentage of subjects exhibiting escape increased in cocaine-treated mice in the Predator Avoidance Test. Cocaine increased mean flight speed and maximum flight speed in the Flight/Chase Test; frequency of flight responses in the Straight Alley Test; and the number of flight attempts in the Forced Contact test. The predominance of flight responding throughout the tests masked any possible cocaine effects on other defenses.

Analysing the effects of human disturbance on wildlife from a predatorprey perspective is also of conservation interest, because individual behavioural responses to the perceived risk of predation may ultimately influence population distribution and demography. The Scandinavian brown bear population provides a good model to study the interactions between an expanding large carnivore population, and people who use forests extensively for professional and recreational activities. We experimentally approached 52 GPS-collared brown bears (293 approaches on foot) from 2006 to 2011, to document the reaction of bears and quantify the effect of disturbance on bear movements. None of the bears reacted aggressively to the observers. Although the location of the animals was known, bears were usually in quite concealed spots and were physically detected in only 16% of the approaches (seen in 42 approaches; heard in 6). However, the bears altered their daily movement patterns after the approaches. Bears increased movement at night-time and moved less at daytime, which was most visible in days 1 and 2 after the approaches, altering their foraging and resting routines. Synthesis and applications. We provide experimental evidence on the effect of human disturbance on a large carnivore. The lack of aggressive reactions to approaching observers reinforces the idea that European brown bears generally avoid people, although bears can respond aggressively if they feel threatened (e.g. when wounded). However, the movement patterns of the bears changed after disturbance. Separating large carnivores and people temporally and spatially is an important goal for conservation and management. Conserving the shrub cover that provides concealment to the carnivores and keeping people away from the most densely vegetated spots in the forests is a way to avoid encounters between carnivores and people, therefore promoting human safety and carnivore conservation.","[Ordiz, Andres; Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Sahlen, Veronica; Pedersen, Bjorn E.; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Saebo, Solve] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Chem Biotechnol & Food Sci, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway",,"Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, Postbox 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com,"Støen, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020; Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019; Swenson, Jon/E-2883-2013; Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020","Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Austrian Science FoundationAustrian Science Fund (FWF); WWF Sweden; Research Council of Norway (RCN)Research Council of Norway; program 'Adaptive management of fish and wildlife populations',"The Scandinavian Brown Bear Research Project (SBBRP) is funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management, Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, the Austrian Science Foundation, WWF Sweden and the Research Council of Norway (RCN).

Cortisol, the stress-hormone, is thought to play an important role in both fear behaviors, but the exact mechanisms are not understood. Using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging we investigated how cortisol modulates the brain's fear systems when humans are under virtual-predator attack. We show dissociated neural effects of cortisol depending on whether escape from threat is possible. During inescapable threat cortisol reduces fear-related midbrain activity, whereas in anticipation of active escape cortisol boosts activity in the frontal salience network (insula and anterior cingulate cortex), which is involved in autonomic control, visceral perception and motivated action. Our findings suggest that cortisol adjusts the human neural threat system from passive fear to active escape, which illuminates the hormone's crucial role in the adaptive flexibility of fear behaviors.

However, little is known about the effects of ethanol on the prey-predator relationship and chemical communication of predation risk. Here, we showed that visual contact with a predator triggers stress axis activation in zebrafish. We also observed a typical stress response in zebrafish receiving water from these conspecifics, indicating that these fish chemically communicate predation risk. Our work is the first to demonstrate how alcohol effects this prey-predator interaction. We showed for the first time that alcohol exposure completely blocks stress axis activation in both fish seeing the predator and in fish that come in indirect contact with a predator by receiving water from these conspecifics. Together with other research results and with the translational relevance of this fish species, our data points to zebrafish as a promising animal model to study human alcoholism.","[Oliveira, Thiago Acosta; Koakoski, Gessi; Ferreira, Daiane; Santos da Rosa, Joao Gabriel; de Abreu, Murilo Sander; Vendrametto Giacomini, Ana Cristina] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Programa Posgrad Farmacol, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Kreutz, Luiz Carlos; Vendrametto Giacomini, Ana Cristina; Oliveira, Ricardo Pimentel; Fagundes, Michele; Gil Barcellos, Leonardo Jose] Univ Passo Fundo, Programa Posgrad Bioexpt, Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; [Piato, Angelo Luis] Univ Comunitaria Regiao Chapeco, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Ambientais, Chapeco, SC, Brazil; [Barreto, Rodrigo Egydio] UNESP, Caunesp, Biosci Inst, Dept Physiol, Botucau, SP, Brazil",,"Barcellos, LJG (corresponding author), Univ Passo Fundo, Programa Posgrad Bioexpt, Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.",lbarcellos@upf.br,"Fagundes, Michele/AAY-6703-2020; Kreutz, Luiz C/A-3729-2015; Barreto, Rodrigo E/A-3440-2013; de Abreu, Murilo Sander/J-9756-2015; Piato, Angelo/K-3444-2012","Kreutz, Luiz C/0000-0002-7685-7401; Barreto, Rodrigo E/0000-0002-4611-0059; de Abreu, Murilo Sander/0000-0001-5562-0715; Piato, Angelo/0000-0001-5109-7306; Fagundes, Michele/0000-0002-7880-8961",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302073/2011-6],"There are no funders.

To test the relationship between these variables and ground use frequency, we studied a group of endangered Coimbra-Filho's titi monkeys (Callicebus coimbrai) in a 14-ha forest fragment in north-eastern Brazil. Terrestriality data were collected on a monthly basis (33 months) using scan sampling procedures from July 2008 to July 2012. Overall, Coimbra-Filho's titi monkeys were recorded during 0.6% of observation time (113 out of 18,164 scans) on the ground. Most of the time on the ground was spent feeding on young leaves (71 records) and the least amount of time on fruits (14 records). Availability of arboreal foods, rainfall, and time of contact with human observers did not influence overall terrestrial behaviour (ground use). However, the timing and nature of the monkeys' terrestrial feeding was strongly related to the absence of arboreal fruit (beta-estimate = -3.078) and young leaf (beta-estimate = -3.515) food resources. We suggest that terrestrial feeding by Coimbra-Filho's titi monkeys could be an adaptation to low arboreal fruit availability and the exploitation of alternative food resources.","[Souza-Alves, Joao Pedro; Barnett, Adrian A.] Univ Fed Paraiba, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol Zool, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [Baccaro, Fabricio B.] Univ Fed Amazonas, Dept Biol, BR-69067005 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Fontes, Isadora P.] Secretaria Municipal Meio Ambiente Sergipe, BR-49097270 Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil; [Oliveira, Marcela A.] Univ Fed Rondonia, Programa Posgrad Biodiversidade & Biotecnol Amazo, Campus Jose Ribeiro Filho, Porto Velho, Brazil; [Silva, Nichollas Magalhaes O.] Univ Fed Rondonia, Programa Posgrad Desenvolvimento Reg & Meio Ambie, Campus Jose Ribeiro Filho, Porto Velho, Brazil; [Souza-Alves, Joao Pedro; Barnett, Adrian A.] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Lab Ecol Comportamento & Conservacao LECC, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Souza-Alves, Joao Pedro] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Postgrad Program Anim Biol, Av Prof Morais Rego 1235,Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil",,"Souza-Alves, JP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol Zool, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.; Souza-Alves, JP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Lab Ecol Comportamento & Conservacao LECC, Recife, PE, Brazil.; Souza-Alves, JP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Zool, Postgrad Program Anim Biol, Av Prof Morais Rego 1235,Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil.",souzaalves1982@gmail.com,"Oliveira, Marcela Alvares/X-7458-2019; Baccaro, Fabricio/H-3885-2012; Souza-Alves, João Pedro/Q-9316-2019","Oliveira, Marcela Alvares/0000-0002-4129-993X; Baccaro, Fabricio/0000-0003-4747-1857; Souza-Alves, João Pedro/0000-0002-8517-1276; Barnett, Adrian Ashton/0000-0002-8829-2719; MAGALHAES OLIVEIRA SILVA, NICHOLLAS/0000-0003-1370-0949",International Primatological Society; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)European Commission; FACEPEFundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE) [BFP-0149-2.05/19]; PNPD/CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [8887.470331/2019-00],"We thank Sr. Ary Ferreira, owner of the Fazenda Trapsa, Jose Elias (Boia) and his family, and Adriano Rodrigues (Xinxinho) for their assistance during fieldwork.

However, topography, vegetation conditions, and anthropogenic infrastructure within parks may limit available habitat. Human activity on trails and roads may lead to indirect habitat loss, further limiting available habitat. Predators and prey may respond differentially to human activity, potentially disrupting ecological processes. However, research on such impacts to wildlife is incomplete, especially at fine spatial and temporal scales. Our research investigated the relationship between wolf and elk distribution and human activity using fine-scale Global Positioning System (GPS) wildlife telemetry locations and hourly human activity measures on trails and roads in Banff, Kootenay, and Yoho National Parks, Canada. We observed a complex interaction between the distance animals were located from trails and human activity level resulting in species adopting both mutual avoidance and differential response behaviors. In areas < 50 m from trails human activity led to a mutual avoidance response by both wolves and elk. In areas 50 - 400 m from trails low levels of human activity led to differential responses; wolves avoided these areas, whereas elk appeared to use these areas as a predation refugia. These differential impacts on elk and wolves may have important implications for trophic dynamics. As human activity increased above two people/hour, areas 50 - 400 m from trails were mutually avoided by both species, resulting in the indirect loss of important montane habitat. If park managers are concerned with human impacts on wolves and elk, or on these species' trophic interactions with other species, they can monitor locations near trails and roads and consider hourly changes of human activity levels in areas important to wildlife.","[Rogala, James Kimo; Coleshill, Jenny; Musiani, Marco] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Hebblewhite, Mark] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",,,,"Hebblewhite, Mark/AAI-8101-2020; hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013; Musiani, Marco/ABB-9387-2021","Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361; Musiani, Marco/0000-0002-6097-5841; Whittington, Jesse/0000-0002-4129-7491",Parks Canada; University of Calgary; ACA; Foothills Model Forest-Chisholm-Dogrib Fire initiative; Sundre Forest Products LTD.; Canon National Parks Science Scholarship for the Americas; Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation; University of AlbertaUniversity of Alberta; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank our funding partners: Parks Canada, the University of Calgary, ACA Challenge Grants in Biodiversity, ACA Grant Eligible Conservation Fund, Foothills Model Forest-Chisholm-Dogrib Fire initiative grants, Sundre Forest Products LTD., Canon National Parks Science Scholarship for the Americas, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, University of Alberta, and a NSERC Discovery grant.

The Mole National Park, which is considered the largest and oldest in Ghana, attracted significant number of tourists over the years, and consequently induced pressures and disturbances to waterbirds. Thus, there is a need to study the human-wildlife interactions and conflicts. This study established the species list of waterbirds at Mole between August 2015 and February 2016, assessed the nature and levels of human disturbance to the birds and determined the alert and flight initiation distances of selected species. A total of 29 waterbird species were recorded of which White-faced Whistling Duck was the most abundant. At a flush rate of 2.5 per hour with each flush lasting 34.0 s, waterbirds at the park spend 85.0 s/h as a result of flushing of which only 17.6 s/h was attributed to human disturbance. Majority of the flushes (70.5%) were caused by indeterminate factors but the potential adverse impact of human induced flushing and the need to minimize or prevent increased rates in the park was indicated by birds perceiving disturbance from tourist/staff to be of the same risk as predation. It was recommended that a setback distance based on the longest Alert Distance (120.8 +/- 31.9 m) and Flight Initiation Distance (32.7 +/- 23.8 m), both of which were recorded for the Grey Heron, should be considered in the management of the park's wetlands.","[Aikins, Timothy Khan; Gbogbo, Francis; Owusu, Erasmus Henaku] Univ Ghana, Dept Anim Biol & Conservat Sci, Box LG 67, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Aikins, Timothy Khan] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Biodivers Conservat & Management, Box TL 1882,Nyankpala Campus, Tamale, Ghana",,"Aikins, TK (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Dept Anim Biol & Conservat Sci, Box LG 67, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",aikinskhan@live.com,,,University of Ghana-Carnegie Next Generation of Academics in Africa Project,Funds for this research were provided by the University of Ghana-Carnegie Next Generation of Academics in Africa Project.

Repeated exposure of wildlife to anthropogenic activities in important habitats may affect habitat selection, leading to negative biological consequences. We quantified the cumulative human exposure of a small, genetically isolated and behaviourally constrained spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) population, off Hawaii Island, and exposure effects on their daytime cumulative activity budget. Dolphins were exposed to human activities within 100 m for 82.7% of the daytime, with a median duration of 10 min between exposure events. Individual dolphins spent on average 61.7% (s.d. = 6.5) of their daytime resting. Of their total rest time, greater than 90% occurred inside sheltered bays. Despite high levels of human exposure, we did not observe an effect on dolphin resting behaviour. The short intervals between exposure events probably prevent dolphins from returning to a natural resting state before the next event. Consequently, 'control' observations may represent a resting behaviour of a more vigilant nature. Chronic levels of exposure to human activities could lead to rest deprivation, displacement from preferred resting habitats and ultimately negative population level effects. These results have implications for new proposed legislation aiming to reduce dolphin exposure to human activities.","[Tyne, Julian A.; Christiansen, Fredrik; Johnston, David W.; Bejder, Lars] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Aquat Megafauna Res Unit, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA, Australia; [Heenehan, Heather L.; Johnston, David W.; Bejder, Lars] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Nicholas Sch Environm, 135 Duke Marine Lab Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Bejder, Lars] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Marine Mammal Res Program, Hawaii, HI USA",,"Tyne, JA (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Aquat Megafauna Res Unit, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA, Australia.",j.tyne@murdoch.edu.au,"Johnston, David/AAJ-5013-2020; Bejder, Lars/D-1772-2017","Tyne, Julian/0000-0002-0676-5659; Johnston, David/0000-0003-2424-036X; Bejder, Lars/0000-0001-8138-8606; Heenehan, Heather/0000-0002-2319-5360",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Marine Mammal Commission; Murdoch University; Dolphin Quest,"Funding for the study was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), The Marine Mammal Commission, Murdoch University and Dolphin Quest.",,72,19,19,0,15,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

Poaching and habitat degradation are threats to the guanaco, a native herbivore of South America characterized by ecological and behavioral adaptations to arid environments. Guanaco presence was seasonally surveyed in mountain environments of Andean Precordillera, corresponding to a protected area and its surroundings. Field surveys and satellite images processing estimated environmental variables ascribed to four predictions: resources availability, habitat complexity, weather conditions, and human activities. Generalized Linear Models estimated the probability of guanaco presence based on each prediction, whose variables with important effect were included in combined models. The main natural influence on the presence of guanaco was plant cover. Conservation activities improved this natural influence, whereas disturbing activities restricted it. The trade-off between high resources availability and low predation risk, as well as the effect of extreme weather conditions were not evident, at least in the study's spatial scale.

Ecological constraints such as habitat saturation can promote delayed dispersal. Thus far, the role of predation risk in the evolution of cooperative breeding systems has received less attention, although it is understood as an important ecological factor shaping dispersal patterns and social structure in animals. To bridge this gap, we analysed group structure and dispersal patterns of helpers within a population of the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus obscurus. We conducted behavioural observations for a period of 3 months at two study sites within this population, which differed in predation risk and availability of unoccupied space. Furthermore, by combining field observations with molecular analyses, we assessed group structure to unravel the dispersal patterns of helpers. At the high predation risk location, we found that helpers (1) had a lower dispersal propensity, (2) dispersed shorter distances and (3) were generally larger. Furthermore, molecular analyses and body size measurements suggest that helpers may stay longer in the natal territory under high predation risk than under low predation risk. Groups contained more helpers in the high predation risk site, which indicates that high predation pressure leads to delayed dispersal of helpers. Unoccupied potential dispersal areas were larger in the high predation risk site, suggesting that habitat saturation did not account for the dispersal patterns. Our results suggest that predation pressure is the main factor limiting the dispersal of helpers in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish N. obscurus, and might be overlooked in other studies focusing on the evolution of cooperative breeding systems.

We assessed wildlife diel activity responses to human presence and consequential changes in predator-prey overlap using 11,111 detections of 3 large carnivores and 11 ungulates across 21,430 camera trap-nights in West Africa. Over two-thirds of species exhibited diel responses to mainly diurnal human presence, with ungulate nocturnal activity increasing by 7.1%. Rather than traditional pairwise predator-prey diel comparisons, we considered spatiotemporally explicit predator access to several prey resources to evaluate community-level trophic responses to human presence. Although leopard prey access was not affected by humans, lion and spotted hyena access to three prey species significantly increased when prey increased their nocturnal activity to avoid humans. Human presence considerably influenced the composition of available prey, with implications for prey selection, demonstrating how humans perturb ecological processes via behavioral modifications.","[Mills, Kirby L.; Harris, Nyeema C.] Univ Michigan, Appl Wildlife Ecol Lab, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Dept, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Mills, KL; Harris, NC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Appl Wildlife Ecol Lab, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Dept, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",kimills@umich.edu; nyeema@umich.edu,,"Mills, Kirby/0000-0001-7693-9629; Harris, Nyeema/0000-0001-5174-2205","Detroit Zoological Society; University of Michigan Office of Research; Department of Afroamerican and African Studies, University of Michigan STEM Initiative; German Society of Mammalian Biology","Detroit Zoological Society Nyeema C Harris; University of Michigan Office of Research Nyeema C Harris; Department of Afroamerican and African Studies, University of Michigan STEM Initiative Nyeema C Harris; German Society of Mammalian Biology Nyeema C Harris; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,65,0,0,5,9,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,NOV 18,2020,9,,,,,,,,e60690,10.7554/eLife.60690,,,16,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,OW4FU,WOS:000592845500001,33206047,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-19,

In the three dimensional rain forest environment with diminishing light at lower levels, downward visibility is difficult, and keen eyesight may not be as effective for detecting in-forest predators as soaring ones. It is therefore predicted that cryptic behaviours, where the problems of detection are shifted to the predator, may be used in these conditions. In Madagascar there is debate on whether extant eagles are a threat to the largest primate species, while there is mounting evidence that a mammalian carnivore, the fossa, impacts heavily on lemur populations. In a new approach to understanding the differential impact of raptor and carnivore hunting styles on lemur anti-predator behaviours, I analyzed ten years of behavioural data on Milne-Edwards' sifakas in the rain forest of Madagascar. I show that Propithecus diadema edwardsi responds to aerial predators by giving loud alarms calls with responsive avoidance behaviour, and by choosing daytime rest sites lower than feeding sites. In response to the mammal predator, Propithecus gave a distinct ground predator call, used higher nighttime sleep sites than daytime rest sites, and males were in most dangerous spatial positions during travel and feeding. The combination of protective travel order, high sleeping sites and small sleeping parties suggested behaviours against fossa predation. However, the dramatic 'alarm call and drop low in the canopy' response to birds of prey is an indication that avian predators are feared.","SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,"Wright, PC (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",pwright@datalab2.sbs.sunysb.edu,,,,,,143,66,68,0,38,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,JUN,1998,135,,4,,,,483,512,,10.1163/156853998793066186,,,30,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,117RV,WOS:000075796300005,,,,,2022-04-19,

Successful urban species modify their fear behaviour in response to the new conditions, as evolutionary mismatches between fear responses and environmental conditions are likely to have negative fitness consequences. Here we tested the effect of urbanisation on the fear response of a successful urban coloniser, the Australian Brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), using flight initiation distance (FID) as a measure of boldness. We predicted that Brush-turkeys in areas of natural vegetation would have longer FIDs than birds in more urbanised environments, and that males would have shorter FIDs than females. We recorded the FIDs of 80 Brush-turkeys across the Sydney region. We found that Brush-turkeys in natural vegetation and urban bushland reserves had longer FIDs than birds in urban streets and lawns. However, there was no difference in FID between sites in natural vegetation and urban bushland reserves. There was no difference in FID between male and female Brush-turkeys, between birds engaged in different behaviours, or between birds approached in the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Our results identified that Brush-turkeys displayed reduced fear behaviour in response to humans in more urban environments.","[Hall, Matthew J.; Burns, Alicia L.; Martin, John M.; Hochuli, Dieter F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Burns, Alicia L.; Martin, John M.] Taronga Conservat Soc Australia, Taronga Inst Sci & Learning, Bradleys Head Rd Mosman, Sydney, NSW 2088, Australia; [Martin, John M.] UNSW Sydney, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,"Hall, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",m.hall@sydney.edu.au,"; Hochuli, Dieter/E-5023-2010","Hall, Matthew/0000-0003-3931-689X; Hochuli, Dieter/0000-0002-6673-4475; Martin, John/0000-0003-2731-9292",,,,53,5,5,3,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,AUG,2020,23,4,,,,,785,791,,10.1007/s11252-020-00969-5,,MAR 2020,7,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,MH4TZ,WOS:000518481500001,,,,,2022-04-19,

Differential predation risk between individuals is often invoked to explain colour variation, but empirical support for this hypothesis is equivocal. We investigated differential conspicuousness and predation risk in two species of Australian rock dragons, Ctenophorus decresii and C. vadnappa. To humans, the coloration of males of these species varies between 'bright' and 'dull'. Visual modelling based on objective colour measurements and the spectral sensitivities of avian visual pigments showed that dragon colour variants are differentially conspicuous to the visual system of avian predators when viewed against the natural background. We conducted field experiments to test for differential predation risk, using plaster models of 'bright' and 'dull' males. 'Bright' models were attacked significantly more often than 'dull' models suggesting that differential conspicuousness translates to differential predation risk in the wild. We also examined the influence of natural geographical range on predation risk. Results from 22 localities suggest that predation rates vary according to whether predators are familiar with the prey species. This study is among the first to demonstrate both differential conspicuousness and differential predation risk in the wild using an experimental protocol.

Roads are a widespread form of human development that carnivores may perceive as efficient travel routes or centers of human activity and associated risk. We compared the spatio-temporal responses of carnivores to human road use with high-resolution tracking of a large carnivore guild including American black bears (Ursus americans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and wolves (C. lupus) in Michigan, USA. All carnivores selected for roads when traveling at night but avoided roads during the day when human activity was greatest. Human activity explained 90% of temporal variation in road use across carnivore species, with a 3.2-3.7-fold increase in road use at times of low human activity which reduced carnivore activity overlap with humans by 27-42%. Similar but less pronounced activity changes occurred in areas up to 500 m from roads. Bears and wolves increased nocturnal activity with more roads in their home range, but not bobcats or coyotes. Despite increased diurnal activity in areas farther from roads, temporal overlap among carnivores was high regardless of mad proximity. Our results suggest that spatio-temporal responses to roads were similar among carnivores and emphasized avoidance of humans over other carnivore species. Further, we provide support that carnivores can be diurnally active while avoiding humans by using areas farther from roads. However, carnivores which are primarily diurnal (e.g., black bears) or have a strong proclivity for using roads (e.g., wolves) likely require greater behavioral changes to avoid humans. Behavioral adaptations allowing multiple species to use and cross roads while avoiding humans are encouraging for human-carnivore coexistence.","[Kautz, Todd M.; Fowler, Nicholas L.; Petroelje, Tyler R.; Belant, Jerrold L.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Global Wildlife Conservat Ctr, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Fowler, Nicholas L.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, 43961 Kalifornsky Beach Rd B, Soldotna, AK 99669 USA; [Beyer, Dean E., Jr.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Svoboda, Nathan J.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, 351 Res Ct, Kodiak, AK 99615 USA",,"Kautz, TM (corresponding author), SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Global Wildlife Conservat Ctr, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",todd.m.kautz@gmail.com,,"Petroelje, Tyler/0000-0003-4957-6732","Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Federal Aid in Restoration Act under Pittman-Robertson project [W-1476-R]; Safari Club International (SCI) Foundation; SCI Michigan Involvement Committee; Camp Fire Conservation Fund","We thank J.

We found Song Sparrows to be more tolerant than Northern Cardinals of human approaches, and urban birds of both species tended to tolerate closer approaches than did rural birds. We then investigated whether cues such as gaze direction or human figure explain differences in Song Sparrows' approach response behaviors. We found urban Song Sparrows' FIDs to be significantly shorter than rural birds' FIDs in response to treatments using a human approach for both direct and concealed gazes. However, no significant habitat differences were detected in response to the non-human approach treatments using umbrellas with and without eyespots.

Some have suggested that outdoor access can negatively impact the welfare of companion cats through increased risks of disease and parasites, injury or death due to traffic, predation or ingestion of toxins, and becoming lost. In addition, cats can negatively influence their environments due to the predation of small birds and mammals, and they are sometimes a nuisance to human neighbors. Despite these concerns, recent estimates suggest that many owners still allow their cats outside, likely because it also provides cats with exercise, and allows them to perform natural behaviors, such as hunting, exploring, and climbing. While some suggest that cats need outdoor access, others recommend ways for cats to meet these needs indoors by providing enrichment and properly supervising cats during outdoor access. This review examines the risks and benefits associated with outdoor access for cats, as well as what is currently known about peoples' practices, knowledge, and attitudes about the provision of outdoor access for cats. Uncontrolled outdoor access is associated with a number of welfare concerns for companion cats, including increased risks of disease and parasites, injury or death due to traffic, predation or ingestion of toxic substances, and getting permanently separated from their owner. In addition, cats pose a threat to local wildlife due to predatory behaviors, and can sometimes be a nuisance to human neighbors. Despite these concerns, recent estimates suggest that many owners are still providing their cats with uncontrolled outdoor access, likely because it also offers welfare benefits by allowing cats to perform natural behaviors, such as hunting, exploring, and climbing. While some have suggested that outdoor access is necessary to meet cats' behavioral needs and to prevent related behavioral problems, others have recommended various environmental enrichment strategies that can be developed to meet these needs within an indoor environment or through supervised and controlled outdoor access.

Many caribou and reindeer populations are declining across the northern hemisphere, and human disturbances have been suggested as a potential cause for these declines. We evaluated the effects of human disturbances in the summer and winter ranges of two migratory caribou herds in northern Quebec and Labrador, Canada. We captured and collared 510 caribou between 2009 and 2015. We first assessed caribou avoidance of human disturbances at a large spatial scale by comparing the density of mines, mining exploration sites, power lines, roads and human settlements within seasonal ranges to their density within available ranges. We estimated the area avoided by caribou (ZOI; zone of influence) around disturbances located within seasonal ranges and evaluated the resulting cumulative habitat loss. We also evaluated the barrier effect of roads and their influence on caribou movement rates. The density of many disturbance types was lower within caribou seasonal ranges than within available ranges, suggesting they avoided disturbances over a large spatial scale. Within seasonal ranges, caribou avoided all disturbance types except power lines. ZOIs were highly variable among disturbance types and years, ranging from no avoidance to 23 km. Cumulative habitat loss could reach as much as 30% of seasonal ranges and 38% of high-quality caribou habitat. We demonstrate that human disturbances have broad negative effects on caribou behavior, but whether this could translate into population decline remains to be investigated.","[Plante, Sabrina; Dussault, Christian; Richard, Julien H.; Cote, Steeve D.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Caribou Ungava, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Plante, Sabrina; Richard, Julien H.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ctr Etud Nord, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Dussault, Christian; Cote, Steeve D.] Minist Forets Faune & Parcs, Direct Expertise Fauna Terr Herpetofaune & Avifau, 880 Chemin St Foy, Ste Foy, PQ G1S 4X4, Canada",,"Plante, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Caribou Ungava, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",Sabrina.Plante.6@ulaval.ca; Christian.Dussault@mffp.gouv.qc.ca; Julien.H-Richard@bio.ulaval.ca; Steeve.Cote@bio.ulaval.ca,,,Fonds de Recherche Quebecois pour la Nature et les Technologies [FRQNT 183343]; Caribou Ungava; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [NSERC RDCPJ 469512-14],"We are grateful to Ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Pares, especially V.

For endangered species, appreciating the effect of human disturbance can be important for their conservation. However, a human disturbance angle is often absent from ecological research, despite growing evidence of the negative impact of non-fatal human interference. Here, we monitored Hainan Eld's deer living within a reserve and translocated animals living amongst villagers. We show that translocated deer deviated from a crepuscular activity pattern and became increasingly nocturnal, and most active when villagers were not. It appears that translocated deer adapted over time to human disturbance and this pattern is similar to that of other species during periods of hunting. People do not pose an actual threat to Eld's deer, but their presence triggered a response akin to predator avoidance and may be interfering with broader aspects of their biology and conservation.","[Pan, Duo; Teng, Liwei; Cui, Fangjie; Zeng, Zhigao; Zhang, Qiong; Song, Yanling] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Song, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, 1-5 Beichenxi Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",panduo5@yahoo.cn; tenglw1975@yahoo.com.cn; cuifj03@163.com; zengzhg@ioz.ac.cn; ben.bravery@kexuecommunications.com; zhangqiong@ioz.ac.cn; songyl@ioz.ac.cn,"Bravery, Benjamin/E-7174-2012",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30770320, 30470260]; Key Project in the National Science and Technology Pillar Program in the Eleventh Five-year Plan Period of China [2008BADB0B01]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 30770320 and 30470260), and as a Key Project in the National Science and Technology Pillar Program in the Eleventh Five-year Plan Period of China (Grant 2008BADB0B01).

Data were obtained from a questionnaire completed with children aged 4 to 13 years in 11 urban and rural primary schools. A total of 103 dog bites sustained by 92 children were analysed using chi square test and F test. There were 58 boys (56.3%) and 45 girls (43.7%) bitten, 57.3% of them once, 42.7% repeatedly. The evaluated answers showed that children were bitten when playing with own dogs (69.2%) or dogs known to them (30.8%) but not by unknown dogs (chi(2) = 25.397, df = 1, p < 0.001). Children were bitten outdoors by loose running unknown dogs (88.5%), known dogs (11.5%) but not by own dogs (chi(2) = 55.528, df = 2, p < 0.001). Thirty-two children were bitten indoors by small (53.1%), medium size (21.9) or large (25.0%) dogs. Small dogs were biting mostly indoors (51.5%), medium size (73.1%) and large (80.5%) dogs bit mostly outdoors (chi(2) = 9.0022, df = 2, p = 0.011). Most of the children that disturbed a resting or sleeping dog were bitten indoors (83.3%; chi(2) = 7.862, df = 1, p < 0.01), predominantly by small dogs (83.3%, chi(2) = 7.482, df = 2, p = 0.022). When stroking a dog, children were bitten by a medium size (45.5%), large (31.8%) or small dog (22.7%; chi(2) = 5.588, df = 2, p < 0.068). Children injured by their family-owned dog had accidentally caused pain to it before being bitten (83.3%; chi(2) = 7.862, df = 1, p < 0.012). These children were always bitten by a small dog (chi(2) = 7.482, df = 2, p = 0.022). Three children reported deliberately causing pain to a dog - these were all small dogs (100.0%; chi(2) = 6.279, df = 2, p < 0.05). Children teasing dogs were bitten most frequently by a small dog (75.0%; chi(2) = 6.98, df = 2, p < 0.032). Male dogs bit more frequently (66.7%) than females (33.3%; chi(2) = 6.338, d.f. = 1, p = 0.014). These data were the first ones obtained from the bitten children. They suggest that in interactions with own, known and small dogs, children were more daring. The personal space of dogs, their warning signals, and defence were underestimated, the resulting aggression was mostly of possessive, territorial and fear type. Additional suggestions are made to complete the information on preventive measures for parents, children and the public. Importantly, all information types should point out that the dog remains a predator despite its long domestication history and close co-existence with humans.","[Nahlik, Jan] Vet Klin Panda, Prague 12000 2, Vinohrady, Czech Republic; [Baranyiova, Eva] Univ Vet & Pharmaceut Sci, Fac Vet Hyg & Ecol, Dept Vet Publ Hlth & Toxicol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Tyrlik, Mojmir] Masaryk Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Psychol, Brno, Czech Republic",,"Nahlik, J (corresponding author), Vet Klin Panda, Prague 12000 2, Vinohrady, Czech Republic.",Honza.Nahlik@seznam.cz,,,MSMT FRVS grant [2345/2006],This study was in part supported by the MSMT FRVS grant No. 2345/2006.,,76,5,5,0,29,VETERINARNI A FARMACEUTICKA UNIVERZITA BRNO,BRNO,"PALACKEHO 1-3, BRNO CS-612 42, CZECH REPUBLIC",0001-7213,,,ACTA VET BRNO,Acta Vet.

Smaller-bodied and less-experienced individuals are presumed to be more vulnerable to predators, suggesting that within-group spatial organization should show size- and age-dependent patterns in predator sensitive positioning. However, such effects have been difficult to evaluate for arboreal primates living in large groups. We conducted a preliminary study using a novel, spatially explicit method of assessing group spatial organization using GIS data in two groups of wild lowland Woolly monkeys, in which one group had a membership roughly twice as large as the second. In the larger group, group spread was more diffuse and large adult males were more frequently on the outskirts of the group than other age/sex classes, while immatures and females with dependents were more often in the center. Leaf cover around an individualpresumed to index an animal's perception of riskincreased significantly with distance from the group center for all immatures, although they were typically under lower leaf cover than adults; the number of groupmates in proximity also had an effect, but nearest neighbor distance did not. These differences were not detectable in the smaller group. This preliminary study suggests that thorough studies of spatial organization and predation risk sensitivity in arboreal primates are possible and could yield valuable information on how gregarious individuals offset ecological risks through social spacing.

We identified incidents of fatal attacks, severe injuries, light injuries, and no Injuries as a function of human age class, group size, body posture, and conspicuous action, such as noise making, running, or shooting, Ordinal multinomial regression revealed that age class (< 13 years old vs. older) was not a statistically reliable predictor of attack severity. This statistical method also revealed that there was no reliable association between the number of individuals present during the attack and attack severity. Nevertheless, examination of specific attack outcomes indicated that the likelihood of escaping injury increased when two or more people were present. The speed that individuals moved during the attack did not predict attack severity, but it was apparent that the lowest likelihood of escaping injury (26%) and greatest frequency of severe injuries (43%) occurred when individuals remained stationary. In contrast, half of the individuals who ran when they were attacked escaped injury, whereas running was associated with only a small increase in the frequency of fatal attacks (28%), compared with remaining stationary (23%). Evidence that half of the individuals who ran escaped injury suggests that pumas are assessing immobility in humans as they might with other prey, using it as an index of prey inattention or disablement and hence greater vulnerability.","[Coss, Richard G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Fitzhugh, E.

These behavioral patterns are assumed to be adaptive although previous studies have not linked them directly to survival and reproductive data to verify the assumed relationship between behavior and fitness. Recent work documented that higher density of secondary roads within home ranges of free-ranging canids (wolves, coyotes and hybrids) increased mortality risk in the hybrid zone adjacent to Algonquin Park in Ontario, Canada. Here, we examine individual behavioral responses of canids to spatially varying levels of human-disturbance and determine whether these responses to secondary roads resulted in differential mortality risk for canids across the hybrid zone. Specifically, we investigated resource selection within home ranges with GPS telemetry to determine whether canids selected roads more at night than during the day to minimize dangerous encounters with humans. Next, we modeled individual variation in spatial and temporal responses to secondary roads to evaluate the relative importance of intrinsic (Canis ancestry) and extrinsic (resource availability) influences on their behavior. Behavioral responses to roads were not well explained by variation in Canis ancestry. Instead, canids avoided roads more during day than at night as a non-linear function of increased road availability. Furthermore, canids that survived exhibited a stronger relationship between day-night selection of roads and road availability than canids that died suggesting an adaptive nature of this behavior. By modifying their selection of roads between day and night, canids appear to be able to exploit the beneficial attributes of roads while mitigating human-caused mortality risk. However, not all canids responded adaptively highlighting the importance of explicitly linking patterns of resource selection to components of fitness to accurately model and interpret individual variation in resource selection behavior of animals.","[Benson, John F.] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Mahoney, Peter J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Patterson, Brent R.] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Wildlife Res & Monitoring Sect, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada",,"Benson, JF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, La Kretz Ctr Calif Conservat, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",benson.johnf@gmail.com,,,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR)-Wildlife Research and Development Section; Trent University through D.

Environments vary both naturally and as a result of human activities, and investigations that simultaneously consider how natural and human-induced environmental variation affect diverse trait types grow increasingly important as human activities drive species endangerment. Here, we examined how habitat fragmentation and structural habitat complexity affect disparate trait types in Bahamas mosquitofish Gambusia hubbsi inhabiting tidal creeks. We tested a priori predictions for how these factors might influence exploratory behaviour, stress reactivity and brain anatomy. We examined approximately 350 adult Bahamas mosquitofish from seven tidal-creek populations across Andros Island, The Bahamas that varied in both human-caused fragmentation (three fragmented and four unfragmented) and natural habitat complexity (e.g. fivefold variation in rock habitat). Populations that had experienced severe human-induced fragmentation, and thus restriction of tidal exchange from the ocean, exhibited greater exploration of a novel environment, stronger physiological stress responses to a mildly stressful event and smaller telencephala (relative to body size). These changes matched adaptive predictions based mostly on (a) reduced chronic predation risk and (b) decreased demands for navigating tidally dynamic habitats. Populations from sites with greater structural habitat complexity showed a higher propensity for exploration and a relatively larger optic tectum and cerebellum. These patterns matched adaptive predictions related to increased demands for navigating complex environments. Our findings demonstrate environmental variation, including recent anthropogenic impacts (<50 years), can significantly affect complex, ecologically important traits. Yet trait-specific patterns may not be easily predicted, as we found strong support for only six of 12 predictions. Our results further highlight the utility of simultaneously quantifying multiple environmental factors-for example had we failed to account for habitat complexity, we would not have detected the effects of fragmentation on exploratory behaviours. These responses, and their ecological consequences, may be complex: rapid and adaptive phenotypic responses to anthropogenic impacts can facilitate persistence in human-altered environments, but may come at a cost of population vulnerability if ecological restoration was to occur without consideration of the altered traits.","[Jenkins, Matthew R.; Cabe, Alex R.; Hulthen, Kaj; Langerhans, R.

For African elephants Loxodonta africana, human pressures from poaching and conflict are primary drivers of species decline, but little is known about how elephants structure their spatial behavior in the face of human occupancy and predation. We seek to understand how elephants balance trade-offs between resource access, human presence and human predatory risk factors (poaching and conflict killing) in an unfenced, dynamic ecosystem where elephants persist primarily outside protected areas in community rangelands. We used tracking data from 101 elephants collected between 2001 and 2016. We investigated elephant behavior in response to landcover, topography, productivity, water, human features and human predation risk using third-order resource selection functions. We extended this analysis by employing a mixed-effects multinomial regression to identify temporal shifts in habitat use, and evaluated temporal shifts in movement patterns by estimating mean squared displacement across different productivity periods. Across periods, elephants displayed strong selection for productive areas and areas near water. Temporal shifts in habitat use showed that, during the dry period, elephants were clustered around permanent water sources where humans also congregated. At the onset of the wet period, a shift occurred where elephants moved away from permanent water and from permanent settlements towards seasonal water sources and seasonal settlements. Our findings indicate that foraging and water access are important limiting factors affecting elephants that potentially restrain their spatial responses to humans at the scale of our analysis.

In this study, the total mercury (THg) concentration in muscle tissue were determined in six sympatric shark species found in a fishing vessel seized in the Galapagos Marine Reserve in 2017. The THg concentrations in shark muscle samples (n = 73) varied from 0.73 mg kg-1 in bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus) to 8.29 mg kg-1 in silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis). A typical pattern of Hg bioaccumulation was observed for all shark species, with significant correlation between THg concentration and shark size for bigeye thresher sharks, pelagic thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus) and silky sharks. Regarding human health concerns, the THg mean concentration exceeded the maximum weekly intake fish serving in all the studied species. Mass-Dependent Fractionation (MDF, ?202Hg values) and Mass-Independent Fractionation (MIF, ?199Hg values) of Hg in whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) and silky sharks, ranged from 0.70%o to 1.08%o, and from 1.97%o to 2.89%o, respectively. These high values suggest that both species are feeding in the epipelagic zone (i.e. upper 200 m of the water column). While, blue sharks (Prionace glauca), scalloped hammerhead sharks (Shyrna lewini) and thresher sharks were characterized by lower ?199Hg and ?202Hg values, indicating that these species may focus their foraging behavior on prey of mesopelagic zone (i.e. between 200 and 1000 m depth). In conclusion, the determination of THg concentration provides straight-forward evidence of the human health risks associated with shark consumption, while mercury isotopic compositions constitute a powerful tool to trace the foraging strategies of these marine predators. Capsule: A double approach combining Hg concentrations with stable isotopes ratios allowed to assess ontogeny in common shark species in the area of the Galapagos Marine Reserve and the human health risks concern associated to their consumption.","[Maurice, Laurence; Le Croizier, Gael; Morales, Gabriela; Sonke, Jeroen; Point, David] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, IRD, Geosci Environm Toulouse GET,Observ Midi Pyrenees, 14 Ave E Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Maurice, Laurence] Univ Andina Simon Bolivar, Area Salud, POB 17-12-569, Quito, Ecuador; [Morales, Gabriela; Carpintero, Natalia; Ochoa-Herrera, Valeria] Univ San Francisco Quito, Colegio Ciencias & Ingn, Inst Biosfera Diego Robles & Via Interocean, Quito, Ecuador; [Guayasamin, Juan M.] Univ San Francisco Quito, Colegio Ciencias Biol & Ambient, Inst Biosfera Diego Robles & Via Interocean, Quito, Ecuador; [Guayasamin, Juan M.; Paez-Rosas, Diego; Ochoa-Herrera, Valeria] Univ San Francisco Quito, Galapagos Sci Ctr, Isla San Cristobal, Islas Galapagos, Ecuador; [Bustos, Walter] Parque Nacl Galapagos, Av Charles Darwin S-N, Santa Cruz, Ecuador",,"Maurice, L (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, IRD, Geosci Environm Toulouse GET,Observ Midi Pyrenees, 14 Ave E Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France.",laurence.maurice@ird.fr,"Páez-Rosas, Diego/X-3047-2019; Maurice, Laurence/T-2636-2019","Páez-Rosas, Diego/0000-0002-2446-9888; Maurice, Laurence/0000-0003-3482-3892; Point, David/0000-0002-5218-7781; Ochoa-Herrera, Valeria/0000-0002-3826-2079",French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD); French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-17-CE34-0010 MERTOX];  [10140],"We are thankful for the logistic and administrative assistance of the Galapagos Science Center, a join research unit from Universidad San Francisco de Quito and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In addition to active defence, they can hide their nests or use the protection of other species breeding nearby that actively defend the nests. Studies evaluating these strategies simultaneously are rare, especially from areas unaltered by humans. Nest predation risks were studied in a wetland bird community at Lake Baikal, Russia. The community contained several species actively defending their nests, although most were passive defenders. Such tactics as active defence, concealed nesting, neighbourhood nesting and coloniality were tested for their effects on predation risk. The main predators were birds, particularly carrion crows (Corvus corone). Analysis of 193 nests using multimodel inference based on Akaike's information criterion suggests the most successful tactic was active nest defence, although most birds applying this tactic build open (uncovered) nests. Passive defenders effectively reduced this risk by nest concealment and/or breeding near active defenders. Opposing patterns were found for active versus passive defenders near the most successful breeder but also a potential nest predator, the Mongolian gull (Larus mongolicus). Conservation implications emphasize support for large aggregations of active nest defenders, vegetation cover providing good nest shelter, and sufficient area of interior habitat reducing edge effects.","[Sladecek, Martin; Kubelka, Vojtech] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic; [Mlikovsky, Jiri] Natl Museum, Dept Zool, Prague 11579, Czech Republic; [Salek, Miroslav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",,"Sladecek, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Vinicna 7, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic.",slava.laguna.os@volny.cz,"Kubelka, Vojt?ch/M-3993-2014; álek, Miroslav/K-1934-2016","Kubelka, Vojt?ch/0000-0002-5015-5890; Salek, Miroslav/0000-0002-8238-3644","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (Grant MSMT Kontakt II) [LH13278]; Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic [DKRVO 2013/14]","Fieldwork was permitted by the head of the Baikal National Park Administration, A.

In rats, pharmacological stimulation of the dorsolateral portion of the PAG (dIPAG) with N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) induces aversive conditioning that acts as an unconditioned stimulus (US). In the present work, we investigated the interplay between the vanilloid TRPVI and cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the NMDA-dIPAG defensive response and in subsequent aversive learning. Rats were subjected to dIPAG NMDA infusion in an olfactory conditioned stimulus (CS) task allowing the evaluation of immediate and long-term defensive behavioral responses during CS presentation. The results indicated that an intermediate dose of NMDA (50 pmol) induced both immediate and long-term effects. A sub-effective dose of NMDA (25 pmol) was potentiated by the TRPV1 receptor agonist capsaicin (CAP, 1 nmol) and the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251 (200 pmol). CAP (10 nmol) or the combination of CAP (1 nmol) and AM251 (200 pmol) induced long-term effects without increasing immediate defensive responses. The glutamate release inhibitor riluzole (2 or 4 nmol) and the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX (2 or 4 nmol) potentiated the immediate effects but blocked the long-term effects. The results showed that immediate defensive responses rely on NMDA receptors, and aversive learning on the fine-tuning of TRPV1, CB1, metabotropic glutamate and AMPA receptors located in pre- and postsynaptic membranes. In conclusion, the activity of the dIPAG determines core affective aspects of aversive memory formation controlled by local TRPV1/CB1 balance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, human use of protected areas can cause disturbance to wildlife, especially in areas that allow hunting and if humans are accompanied by dogs (Canis familiaris). We used citizen-science run camera traps to investigate how humans, dogs and coyotes (Canis latrans) used 33 protected areas and analyzed behavioral responses by three prey species: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and northern raccoon (Procyon lotor). We obtained 52,863 detections of native wildlife, 162,418 detections of humans and 23,332 detections of dogs over 42,874 camera nights. Most dogs (99%) were on the trail, and 89% of off-trail dogs were accompanied by humans. Prey avoided dogs, humans and coyotes temporally, but did not avoid them spatially, or greatly increase vigilance. Our results indicate that humans are perceived as a greater risk than coyotes, and this increases when dogs accompany their owners. The concentration of dogs on the trail with their owners, and relatively minor behavioral impacts on prey, contrasts the strong negative ecological effects found in studies of free ranging dogs. We found dog management to be effective: prohibiting dogs in protected areas reduced their use of an area by a factor of 10 and leash laws increased leashing rates by 21%. Although millions of dogs use natural areas in North America each year, regulations enacted by protected areas combined with responsible management of dog behavior greatly reduce the ecological impact of man's best friend.

Thus, understanding the behavioural response to human-induced changes is crucial in the interplay between ecology, evolution, conservation and management. Yet the behavioural response to fishing activities has been largely ignored. We review studies contrasting how fish behaviour affects catch by passive (e.g., long lines, angling) versus active gears (e.g., trawls, seines). We show that fishing not only targets certain behaviours, but it leads to a multitrait response including behavioural, physiological and life-history traits with population, community and ecosystem consequences. Fisheries-driven change (plastic or evolutionary) of fish behaviour and its correlated traits could impact fish populations well beyond their survival per se, affecting predation risk, foraging behaviour, dispersal, parental care, etc., and hence numerous ecological issues including population dynamics and trophic cascades. In particular, we discuss implications of behavioural responses to fishing for fisheries management and population resilience. More research on these topics, however, is needed to draw general conclusions, and we suggest fruitful directions for future studies.","[Diaz Pauli, Beatriz] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway; [Diaz Pauli, Beatriz] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, Oslo, Norway; [Diaz Pauli, Beatriz] Paris Diderot Univ Paris 07, iEES Paris, Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06,CNRS,INRA,IRD,UPEC, Paris, France; [Sih, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Diaz Pauli, B (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, Oslo, Norway.",b.d.pauli@ibv.uio.no,"Diaz Pauli, Beatriz/AAB-8165-2022; Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Diaz Pauli, Beatriz/0000-0002-9421-7758; Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [214189/F20]; Leiv Eirikkson mobility grant [234569/F1]; CEES/IBV at the University of Oslo [IOS 1456724]; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [214189/F20]; Leiv Eirikkson mobility grant [234569/F1]; CEES/IBV at the University of Oslo [IOS 1456724],"We are grateful to Anders Ferno and Anne Gro Salvanes for valuable discussions and Pierre-Olivier Montiglio, Fabian Zimmerman and Mikko Heino, as well as anonymous reviewers, for very helpful comments and discussion on earlier version of the manuscript.

Mussel response to increasing daily algal ration was to increase mean gape angle per day and was associated with copious pseudofaeces production at excessive initial algal concentrations, e.g. 250 cells/mu l. Mean gape angle decreased (backward S-shaped curve) when fed a fixed algal ration per day where simulated predation risk (introduced fresh mussel homogenate) increased in the water, presumably as an anti-predation strategy. However, this behaviour is presumed to lower feeding rates. There was a general positive relationship between both gape angle and the extent of valve movement (abduction/adduction) per event and valve movement speed. However, the fastest valve adduction events, which resulted in valve closure, were recorded independent of gape angle and only when mussels were first exposed to high perceived predation risk. We interpret this as an appropriate response, with high energetic cost, as a first line of defence from predators such as starfish and crabs. Overall, mussel response to predation appears graded and complex, indicating a trade-off between maximizing feeding/pseudofaeces production and minimizing predation risk.","[Robson, Anthony A.] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, UMR CNRS 6539, Lab Sci Environm Marin, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [De Leaniz, Carlos Garcia; Wilson, Rory P.] Swansea Univ, Sch Environm & Soc, Inst Environm Sustainabil, Dept Pure & Appl Ecol, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Halsey, Lewis G.] Roehampton Univ, Sch Human & Life Sci, London SW15 4JD, England",,"Robson, AA (corresponding author), Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Inst Univ Europeen Mer, UMR CNRS 6539, Lab Sci Environm Marin, Technopole Brest Iroise,Pl Nicolas Copernic, F-29280 Plouzane, France.",tonesterob@hotmail.com,"Robson, Anthony/AAJ-6162-2020; de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia/AAQ-4171-2020; Halsey, Lewis/B-8498-2011; Robson, Anthony A/E-2683-2013; Garcia de Leaniz, Carlos/B-4396-2011","Robson, Anthony/0000-0001-9878-8972; de Leaniz, Carlos Garcia/0000-0003-1650-2729; Halsey, Lewis/0000-0002-0786-7585; Robson, Anthony A/0000-0001-9878-8972; Garcia de Leaniz, Carlos/0000-0003-1650-2729",European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Deep Dock Ltd.,"We are grateful to Graeme Hays, Alexis Wilson, Nikolai Liebsch, Keith Naylor, Maud Coudert and James Wilson for help during the study.

Hayden Valley provides prime habitat for grizzly bears and is known to have high densities of bears. During 1970-2017, 23% (10 of 44) of all backcountry grizzly bear-inflicted human injuries and fatalities in YNP occurred in the valley even though it comprises only 1% of the park. In addition, 3 of the last 5 fatal bear attacks in the park occurred in the valley. We evaluated retrospectively whether restrictions and closures on visitor recreational activity would have prevented many of these injuries. We considered prohibitions on recreational activity during seasons when bears forage for specific high-quality foods; potential closures that coincided with the times of day and year bears were most active in the valley; and visitor use restrictions that would have prevented the most common human behaviors associated with grizzly bear-caused human injuries. The food-based closure that may have prevented the most human injuries occurred during middle to late summer when bears scavenge bison (Bison bison) carcasses that result from annual rutting behavior of bison in the valley. However, safety precautions such as hiking in groups of >= 3, remaining on maintained trails, and carrying bear spray would likely reduce the frequency of bear-inflicted human injuries more than most food-based seasonal closures. Our analyses provide broadly applicable findings regarding use of visitor behavior restrictions and seasonal closures to reduce the risk of bear-inflicted human injuries.","[Gunther, Kerry A.] Natl Pk Serv, Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Bear Management Off, POB 168, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA; [Haroldson, Mark A.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, Interagcy Grizzly Bear Study Team, 2327 Univ Way,Suite 2, Bozeman, MT 59178 USA",,"Gunther, KA (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Bear Management Off, POB 168, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA.",kerry_gunther@nps.gov,,,Yellowstone National Park (YNP); Yellowstone Forever; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey,"Funding for this study was provided by Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Yellowstone Forever, and the U.S. Geological Survey.

The most common measure to characterize chronotypes in animals as well as humans is the onset of activity (i.e., early or late chronotypes). However, daily activity rhythms may also differ in the relative amount of activity displayed at particular time periods. Moreover, chronotypes may also be linked to other consistent inter-individual differences in behavior (i.e., personality), such as the propensity to take risks. Here, we used the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus to test the presence of chronotypes and risk-taking personality traits and a potential behavioral syndrome between these traits. We first exposed crayfish to 5 days of light-darkness to measure daily activity rhythms and then we applied a visual predator-simulating stimulus in 2 different contexts (neutral and food). Our results showed consistent (i.e., across 5 days) inter-individual differences in the relative nocturnal activity displayed in the early and middle, but not in the late part of darkness hours. Moreover, while crayfish displayed inter-individual differences in risk-taking behavior, these were not found to be consistent across 2 contexts. Therefore, we were not able to formally test a behavioral syndrome between these 2 traits. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence of chronotypes in the relative amount of activity displayed at particular time periods. This could be a valuable information for applied ecological aspects related to the signal crayfish, which is a major invasive species of freshwater ecosystems.","[Sbragaglia, Valerio] Marine Sci Inst ICM CSIC, Dept Marine Renewable Resources, Passeig Maritim de la Barceloneta 37, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Sbragaglia, Valerio] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Breithaupt, Thomas] Univ Hull, Dept Biol & Marine Sci, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",,"Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Marine Sci Inst ICM CSIC, Dept Marine Renewable Resources, Passeig Maritim de la Barceloneta 37, Barcelona 08003, Spain.; Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.",valeriosbra@gmail.com,,,Leibniz-DAAD Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [91632699]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [IJC2018-035389-I]; Severo Ochoa Centre of Excellence accreditation [CEX2019-000928-S],"V.S. was supported by a Leibniz-DAAD Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (no. 91632699), while he is now supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation with a Juan de la Cierva Incorporacion research fellowship (IJC2018-035389-I) and he acknowledges the Severo Ochoa Centre of Excellence accreditation (CEX2019-000928-S).",,47,1,1,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1674-5507,2396-9814,,CURR ZOOL,Curr.

Reptiles respond to humans as potential predators by escaping to refuges or by increasing antipredator behaviours which lead to a loss of body condition and may have important consequences for fitness. We assessed effects of human pressure on parasitism and body condition of the endangered insular lizard Podarcis lilfordi in Aire Island (Balearic Islands, Spain). Two areas differing in the number of visitors were compared at different seasons: spring, with almost no human pressure, and summer, when the major bulk of visitors arrive. Compared across seasons, the lizards from areas frequented by humans suffered a greater loss of body condition and showed a less parasitism reduction compared to individuals from the undisturbed area. Therefore, human disturbance seems to have deleterious effects on body condition and other fitness-related drivers, as parasitism. Results evidence important consequences of tourism for short- and long-term fitness of individuals and should be considered when designing conservation plans or management strategies.","[Garrido, Mario; Perez-Mellado, Valentin] Univ Salamanca, Dept Anim Biol, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",,"Garrido, M (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Dept Anim Biol, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",gaiarrido@usal.es,"Garrido, Mario/AAA-7872-2020; Perez-Mellado, Valentin/G-3476-2015","Garrido, Mario/0000-0001-7899-8913; Perez-Mellado, Valentin/0000-0002-7137-4945",,,,28,2,2,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Background: Nestling birds show distinct behavioural responses either to parental begging-solicitation calls (switch-on begging, lower-frequency sounds) or to parental alarm calls (switch-off begging, high-frequency sounds), but rarely to both. Previous theory suggested that differences in the vibrational conductance of cup versus cavity nests drive the evolution of divergent nestling responses to the different types of parental vocalizations. Many predators eavesdrop on begging displays of nestling birds, then locate the nest and prey on the brood. The risk of predation on broods in cup nests is consistently greater than on broods in cavity nests. New theory: Whether nestlings respond to parental begging-solicitation calls (switch-on) or to parental alarm calls (switch-off) is dependent on a trade-off influenced by predation risks. Although switch-on calls are more efficient at protecting the nestlings that perceive them, they are less efficient at delivering their signal to younger nestlings with poorer sensory and discriminatory abilities (compared with switch-off calls). Thus, where predation risk is high, 'off' calls are favoured; where predation risk is lower, 'on' calls are favoured. Hypotheses: Cup-nesting species, which have higher rates of predation, use 'off' signals, which their young are able to sense early in life before they can sense 'on' signals. Cavity-nesting species are the opposite in all particulars. In addition, cavity nestlings develop the ability to sense low-frequency 'on' sounds later than cup nestlings develop the ability to sense high-frequency 'off' signals. Method: We examined existing comparative data on predation rates at different nesting locations. Using auditory brainstem response studies, we also examined data on the development (ontogeny) of acoustic sensitivity in altricial avian species. Results: Nestlings of cup-nesting species suffer relatively higher predation rates than nestlings of cavity-nesting species. At first, nestlings can hear only a narrow range of sound frequencies. Nestlings gradually develop sensitivity to the full spectrum of vocalizations only after several weeks. The sparse data available on avian auditory ontogeny indicate that cup-nesting species develop early sensitivity to high-frequency sounds, and cavity nesters do so to lower-frequency sounds. Conclusion: The higher predation rates of cup nesters compared with cavity nesters, coupled with the post-hatching delay of all nestlings in achieving full sensitivity to the different types and frequency ranges of parental calls, provide a reasonable explanation for the evolutionary advantage of alarm calls to cup nesters and begging-solicitation calls to cavity nesters.","[Lock, Justin] Smithsonian Inst, Ctr Conservat & Evolutionary Genet, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Lock, Justin; Hauber, Mark E.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Hauber, Mark E.] CUNY, Hunter Coll & Grad Ctr, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10021 USA",,"Lock, J (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Ctr Conservat & Evolutionary Genet, Natl Zool Pk, Washington, DC 20013 USA.",lock.justin.c@gmail.com,,,"Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program; Center for Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics, Smithsonian Institution","We thank the Human Frontier Science Program and the Center for Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics, Smithsonian Institution for funding.

Baboons regularly sleep on cliff faces and in trees at night, ostensibly to avoid such predators. Despite retreating to such refuges, baboons are most often killed by leopards at or near their sleeping sites. Because of the challenges of studying nocturnal behavior and human-averse predators, few systematic data exist to reveal how leopard ranging near baboon sleeping sites influences baboons' selection of sites and behavior at those sites. To investigate leopard-baboon dynamics at sleeping sites we deployed GPS/VHF radio collars on six representatives of four baboon groups and four leopards during a 14-month field study in Kenya. We used locations recorded every 15 min to identify baboons' cliffside and riverine sleeping sites, the frequency and duration of leopard visits to these sites, and baboons' adjustments in site use after leopard visits. Collared leopards visited riverine sites more frequently than cliffside sites, whereas most baboon groups strongly preferred cliffside sites, suggesting that leopard visits were often due to factors other than baboon presence, and that baboons used cliffside sites to reduce their risk of leopard predation. Regardless of type, collared leopards remained near baboon-occupied sleeping sites longer than vacant ones, indicating interest in hunting baboons then. Baboons at riverine sites departed later on mornings after leopard visits. Baboon groups occasionally shared sleeping sites simultaneously, possibly reducing risk through dilution. However, they did not reduce risk by frequently changing sleeping sites, minimizing detection at sleeping sites, or after leopard visits, arriving earlier the next evening or moving to a different site. Future research should explore if baboons readily detect nocturnal leopard presence and if predation-related changes in sleeping site use have cascading ecological effects.","[Bidner, Laura R.; Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bidner, Laura R.; Matsumoto-Oda, Akiko; Isbell, Lynne A.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Matsumoto-Oda, Akiko] Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Tourism Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan; [Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA USA",,"Bidner, LR (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Human Evolut & Social Change, POB 872402, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",lrbidner@gmail.com,,"Bidner, Laura/0000-0002-4198-6609","Division of Behavioral and Cognitive SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [126638999-03949]; Leakey Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KEKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23405016]; Wenner-Gren Foundation [8386]; National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation of Kenya [P/15/5820/4650]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 99-03949, BCS 1266389]; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System","Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, Grant number: 126638999-03949; Leakey Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KEKENHI, Grant number: 23405016; Wenner-Gren Foundation, Grant number: 8386; University of California; National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation of Kenya, Grant number: P/15/5820/4650; National Science Foundation, Grant numbers: BCS 99-03949, BCS 1266389",,53,10,10,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-2565,1098-2345,,AM J PRIMATOL,Am.

Recent theory suggests that fine-scale individual differences in investment into current versus future reproduction may lead to a 'slow-fast'-pace-of-life continuum, also referred to as the 'pace-of-life-syndrome' (POLS) hypothesis. According to this idea, individuals are predicted to differ in their level of risk-taking, which may drive among-individual variation and covariation of behaviours. Consistent individual differences in aggression, an ecologically relevant and potentially risky behaviour, have been reported across the animal kingdom. Here we test whether such individual differences in aggression are a manifestation of underlying differences in risk-taking. In a wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) population, we used standard behavioural tests to investigate if male territorial aggressiveness and risk-taking during breeding are positively related. At the start of breeding, we simulated conspecific territorial intrusions to obtain repeated measures of male aggressiveness. Subsequently, we measured male risk-taking as their latency to resume brood provisioning after presenting two different predators at their nest: human and sparrowhawk, a common predator of adult songbirds. First, we found substantial repeatability for male aggressiveness (R = 0.56 +/- 0.08 SE). Second, while males took longer to resume provisioning after presentation of a sparrowhawk mount as compared to a human observer, risk-taking was repeatable across these two predator contexts (R = 0.51 +/- 0.13 SE). Finally, we found no evidence for a correlation between male aggressiveness and risk-taking, thereby providing little support to a main prediction of the POLS hypothesis. Significance statement Consistent, and often correlated, individual differences in basal behaviours, such as aggression, exploration and sociability, are found across the animal kingdom. Why individuals consistently differ in their behaviour is poorly understood, as behavioural traits would seem inherently flexible. The 'pace-of-life syndrome' (POLS) hypothesis proposes observed behavioural variation to reflect differences in risk-taking associated with individual reproductive strategies. We tested this idea in a wild blue tit population by investigating whether individual males that were more aggressive toward territorial intruders also took more risk when provisioning their nestlings under a threat of predation. While we found consistent individual differences in both aggressiveness and risk-taking, these behaviours were not significantly correlated. Therefore, our study demonstrates among-individual variation in ecologically relevant behaviours in wild blue tits but provides little support for the POLS hypothesis.","[Salazar, Stephen M.; Fokkema, Rienk W.; Korsten, Peter] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Anim Behav, Morgenbreede 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Salazar, Stephen M.; Komdeur, Jan] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Behav & Physiol Ecol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Garcia, Julia I.

This insight recently led to the conceptual development of a landscape of coexistence that can be used to identify areas which can sustain large predator populations in human dominated landscapes. In this study we applied the landscape of coexistence concept to a large predator in Europe. We investigated to what extent Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx habitat selection is affected by human disturbance in a human dominated landscape. More specifically, we were interested in the existence of a tradeoff between the availability of roe deer, one of their main prey and avoidance of human disturbance and how this affects the spatio-temporal space use patterns of lynx. We found that lynx face a tradeoff between high prey availability and avoidance of human disturbance and that they respond to this by using areas of high prey availability (but also high human disturbance) during the night when human activity is low. Furthermore our analysis showed that lynx increase their travelling speed and remain more in cover when they are close to areas of high human disturbance. Despite clear behavioral adjustments in response to human presence, prey availability still proved to be the most important predictor of lynx occurrence at small spatial scale, whereas human disturbance was considerably less important. The results of our study demonstrate how spatio-temporal adaptations in habitat selection enable large carnivores to persist in human dominated landscapes and demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of a landscape of coexistence to develop adaptive management plans for endangered populations of large carnivores.","[Gehr, Benedikt; Muff, Stefanie; Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Muff, Stefanie] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hofer, Elizabeth J.; Ryser, Andreas; Vimercati, Eric; Vogt, Kristina] KORA, Carnivore Ecol & Wildlife Management, Muri, Switzerland; [Vogt, Kristina] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci Zool & Evolut, Basel, Switzerland",,"Gehr, B (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",benedikt.gehr@ieu.uzh.ch,,"Gehr, Benedikt/0000-0002-1044-9296; Lukas, Keller/0000-0002-0149-0174; Muff, Stefanie/0000-0002-8425-0757",Federal Office for the Environment; Canton of Berne,We thank the Federal Office for the Environment and the hunting authorities of the Canton of Berne for their financial contribution to this research project.

To examine this relationship, a human observer approached groups of Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), varying his behavior to simulate more or less threatening behavior. We measured the focal deer's angle of escape, distance moved during flight, duration of trotting and stotting behavior, and change in elevation during flight. Analyses revealed positive relationships between the distance moved during flight and the distance at which they fled. When flight was initiated when the approacher was close, deer fled relatively shorter distances and took flight paths at more acute angles, a property that would force a real predator to change direction suddenly. Our results indicate that deer do not compensate for allowing the observer to approach more closely by fleeing greater distances. Rather, distance moved and flight initiation distance are linked by level of reactivity and habituation: more reactive or less habituated deer both flee at a greater distance and move away to a greater distance during flight. More threatening behavior by the approacher led to longer durations of rapid flight behavior (e.g., trotting and stotting), and deer tended to flee uphill and into taller vegetation, using these landscape features as refuge from danger. Finally, we provide the first evidence for Pitcher's untested antiambush hypothesis for the function of stotting and discuss its significance. In general, both preflight predator behavior and habitat features influence both duration and direction of escape.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Stankowich, T (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, 319 Morrill Sci Ctr S,611 N Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",teds@bio.umass.edu,,"Stankowich, Theodore/0000-0002-6579-7765; Coss, Richard/0000-0002-7981-8862",,,,72,83,85,0,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In woodland caribou, human disturbances are associated with higher predation risk. Between 2004 and 2011, we investigated if habitat selection strategies of female caribou towards disturbances influenced their calf's survival in managed boreal forest with varying intensities of human disturbances. Calf survival was 53 % and 43 % after 30 and 90 days following birth, respectively, and 52 % of calves that died were killed by black bear. The probability that a female lose its calf to predation was not influenced by habitat composition of her annual home range, but decreased with an increase in proportion of open lichen woodland within her calving home range. At the local scale, females that did not lose their calf displayed stronger avoidance of high road density areas than females that lost their calf to predation. Further, females that lost their calf to predation and that had a low proportion of a parts per thousand currency sign5-year-old cutovers within their calving home range were mostly observed in areas where these young cutovers were locally absent. Also, females that lost their calf to predation and that had a high proportion of a parts per thousand currency sign5-year-old cutovers within their calving home range were mostly observed in areas with a high local density of a parts per thousand currency sign5-year-old cutovers. Our study demonstrates that we have to account for human-induced disturbances at both local and regional scales in order to further enhance effective caribou management plans.

Physiological stress reactions have been shown to affect the immune system of an animal and therefore may also affect the amount of maternal antibodies a female transmits to her offspring. A few studies have revealed that the presence of predators affects the amount of maternal antibodies deposited into eggs of birds. In this study, using Eurasian blue and great tit offspring (Cyanistes caeruleus and Parus major) as model species, we experimentally tested whether human recreation induces changes in the amount of circulating antibodies in young nestlings and whether this effect is modulated by habitat and competition. Moreover, we investigated whether these variations in antibody titre in turn have an impact on hatching success and offspring growth. Nestlings of great tit females that had been disturbed by experimental human recreation during egg laying had lower antibody titres compared with control nestlings. Antibody titre of nestling blue tits showed a negative correlation with the presence of great tits, rather than with human disturbance. The hatching success was positively correlated with the average amount of antibodies in great tit nestlings, independent of the treatment. Antibody titre in the first days of life in both species was positively correlated with body mass, but this relationship disappeared at fledging and was independent of treatment. We suggest that human recreation may have caused a stress-driven activation of the HPA axis in breeding females, chronically increasing their circulating corticosterone, which is known to have an immunosuppressive function. Either, lower amounts of antibodies are transmitted to nestlings or impaired transfer mechanisms lead to lower amounts of immunoglobulins in the eggs. Human disturbance could, therefore, have negative effects on nestling survival at early life-stages, when nestlings are heavily reliant on maternal antibodies, and in turn lead to lower breeding success and parental fitness. This is a so far overlooked effect of disturbance on early life in birds.","[Boetsch, Yves; Tablado, Zulima; Almasi, Bettina; Jenni, Lukas] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Seerose 1, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland; [Boetsch, Yves] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Boetsch, Yves] Michael Otto Inst NABU, D-24861 Bergenhusen, Germany",,"Botsch, Y (corresponding author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Seerose 1, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland.; Botsch, Y (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.; Botsch, Y (corresponding author), Michael Otto Inst NABU, D-24861 Bergenhusen, Germany.",yves.boetsch@nabu.de,"Bötsch, Yves/H-9800-2019; Tablado, Zulima/AAN-7484-2020","Bötsch, Yves/0000-0001-9171-8752; Almasi, Bettina/0000-0003-4962-8117; Tablado, Zulima/0000-0003-4520-9417",,,,66,3,3,1,1,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

This scarcity/risk hypothesis was developed to account for the foraging patterns of small animals with high metabolic rates susceptible to the threat of starvation. In this paper, we propose that animals should also be risk-prone when their diet quality is particularly high, far exceeding that which is needed to survive. Under these circumstances, the costs of experiencing a low or negative payoff can easily be recouped. We suggest that large-bodied omnivores are most likely to adopt this abundance/risk strategy. We investigate this question among wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that choose between a risk-averse strategy of feeding on plant material and a risk-prone strategy of hunting red colobus monkeys. Using 14 years of data on the Kanyawara chimpanzees of Kibale National Park, Uganda, we find strong evidence that chimpanzees follow the abundance/risk strategy. Both hunting rate (hunts/100 observation hours) and the probability of hunting upon encountering red colobus monkeys were positively correlated with seasonal consumption of ripe drupe fruits, a class of preferred food associated with elevated reproductive performance by females. Critically, these results remained statistically significant after controlling for the potentially confounding effects of male chimpanzee party size and the presence of sexually receptive females. These findings suggest that the relationship between risk-sensitive foraging and diet quality depends upon the daily probability of starvation, the number of alternative foraging strategies, and the degree to which diet quality satisfies an animal's nutritional requirements.","Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anthropol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Gilby, IC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anthropol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gilby@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,53,87,89,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Human predators present a particularly interesting cognitive challenge, as it is typically the case that different human subgroups pose radically different levels of danger to animals living around them. Although a number of prey species have proved able to discriminate between certain human categories on the basis of visual and olfactory cues, vocalizations potentially provide a much richer source of information. We now use controlled playback experiments to investigate whether family groups of free-ranging African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in Amboseli National Park, Kenya can use acoustic characteristics of speech to make functionally relevant distinctions between human subcategories differing not only in ethnicity but also in sex and age. Our results demonstrate that elephants can reliably discriminate between two different ethnic groups that differ in the level of threat they represent, significantly increasing their probability of defensive bunching and investigative smelling following playbacks of Maasai voices. Moreover, these responses were specific to the sex and age of Maasai presented, with the voices of Maasai women and boys, subcategories that would generally pose little threat, significantly less likely to produce these behavioral responses. Considering the long history and often pervasive predatory threat associated with humans across the globe, it is likely that abilities to precisely identify dangerous subcategories of humans on the basis of subtle voice characteristics could have been selected for in other cognitively advanced animal species.","[McComb, Karen; Shannon, Graeme] Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; [Sayialel, Katito N.; Moss, Cynthia] Amboseli Trust Elephants, Amboseli Elephant Res Project, Nairobi 00509, Kenya",,"McComb, K (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England.",karenm@sussex.ac.uk; G.Shannon@sussex.ac.uk,"Shannon, Graeme/A-5790-2011","Shannon, Graeme/0000-0002-5039-4904",Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [F/00 230/AC],"We thank the Kenyan Office of the President and Kenya Wildlife Services for permission to conduct the research in Amboseli National Park; Kenya Airways, P.

In this study we evaluated the effects of an early stressful experience (i.e. a rough visual and acoustical contact with humans) on the antipredatory reactions of adult Rock partridges. During the 1st week after hatching, one group of Rock partridges was exposed to repeated human intrusions into its aviary, and another undisturbed group served as control. Five months later, we observed that the escape reaction to an approaching human was elicited at greater distances in the experimental group than in the control one. On the other hand, the repeated disturbance by a human did not affect the reactions to raptor and fox dummies, which were however appropriate to the predator. In the Rock partridge the effect of this early aversive interaction was thus stimulus-specific, increasing defensive response only to the predator they experienced, although avoidance behaviour was not generalized to further common predators of these game-birds. This study stresses the importance, in farm reared birds, of the early experience of specific aversive stimuli to develop long-term appropriate responses to predators, and thus to increase the probability of survival after release in nature.","Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet, I-50125 Florence, Italy; Allevamento Urogallo, I-36012 Asiago, Italy",,"Zaccaroni, M (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet, Via Romana 17, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",marco.zaccaroni@unifi.it,,"zaccaroni, marco/0000-0002-3588-6476",,,,37,18,19,1,25,UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI FIRENZE,FLORENCE,"C/O PROF F DESSI-FULGHERI, VIA ROMANA 17, 50125 FLORENCE, ITALY",0394-9370,,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

Field experiments using a human simulated predator show that a lizard, the broad-headed skink, Eumeces laticeps, alters several aspects of feeding behavior in ways suggesting tradeoffs between predation risk and feeding. When food (cricket) was closer to the predator, the lizards more frequently did not attack it. and often retreated to safety before consuming it, reducing the duration of exposure to predation. The probability of attacking a cricket decreased with distance of the lizard from refuge, reflecting greater risk due to increased time required to reach refuge. Latency to attach increased with distance of the lizard from refuge, suggesting that lizards assessed the risk as acceptable after observing the predator's continued immobility. Large crickets were attacked with higher probability and shorter latency than small crickets, indicating that greater risk was acceptable fur greater energetic benefit. The lizards more frequently carried large than small crickets to refuges before eating them, reducing duration of exposure because handling time was greater for larger crickets. Smaller crickets were consumed where captured, again indicating modification of feeding behavior in response to predation risk. The skinks also reduced risk by reducing handling time when closer to the predator. Escape was delayed until a predator approached closer when lizards were eating than when not eating. This delay may reflect a tradeoff between predation risk and acquisition of food.","Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA",,"Cooper, WE (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA.",,,,,,,36,101,103,1,30,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,SEP,2000,137,,9,,,,1175,1189,,10.1163/156853900502583,,,15,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,384XV,WOS:000165973300003,,,,,2022-04-19,

While the benefits of familiarity for locating resources have been reported previously, the potential value of familiarity for predation avoidance has been accorded less attention. It has been suggested that familiarity should be beneficial for anti-predator behaviour when direct cues of predation risk are unclear and do not allow prey to identify well-defined spatial refuges. However, to our knowledge, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. Here, we assessed how site familiarity, measured as the intensity of use of a given location, is associated with the probability of roe deer Capreolus capreolus being killed by two predators with contrasting hunting tactics, the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and human hunters. While risk of human hunting was confined to open habitats, risk of lynx predation was more diffuse, with no clear refuge areas. We estimated cause-specific mortality rates in a competing risk framework for 212 GPS-collared roe deer in two ecologically distinct areas of Central Europe to test the hypothesis that the daily risk of being killed by lynx or hunters should be lower in areas of high familiarity. We found strong evidence that site familiarity reduces the risk of being predated by lynx, whereas the evidence that the risk of being hunted is linked to site familiarity was weak. We suggest that local knowledge about small-scale differences in predation risk and information about efficient escape routes affect an individual's ability to avoid or escape an attack by an ambush predator. Our study emphasizes the role of site familiarity in determining the susceptibility of prey to predation. Further research will be required to understand better how a cognitive map of individual spatial information is beneficial for avoiding predation in the arms race that drives the predator-prey shell game.","[Gehr, Benedikt; Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gehr, Benedikt] Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS,UMR 5175,Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, Montpellier 5, France; [Bonnot, Nadege C.] INRAE, EFNO, Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; [Heurich, Marco; Premier, Joseph] Bavarian Forest Natl Pk, Dept Visitor Management & Natl Pk Monitoring, Grafenau, Germany; [Heurich, Marco; Premier, Joseph] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Wildlife Ecol & Wildlife Management, Freiburg, Germany; [Cagnacci, Francesca; Ranc, Nathan] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, Dept Biodivers & Mol Ecol, Trentino, Italy; [Cagnacci, Francesca; Ranc, Nathan] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ciuti, Simone] Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Hewison, A.

The present study emphasises the wealth of information obtained from studying a remnant population of a medium-sized ungulate, the impala (Aepyceros melampus), on degraded rangelands in Rwanda. Compared with impala occurring under similar climatic conditions in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the study population showed a marked reduction in daytime activity, absence of a mid-day resting phase, and a slight increase in activity towards the late afternoon. This pattern was not directly correlated with daily variation in human activity. It is argued that hunting/poaching leads impala to seek shelter to such a degree that any daytime rhythmicity in activity patterns is lost and that increased afternoon activity reflects a shifted cost-benefit ratio of hiding versus foraging, as hungry individuals are more likely to take risks. Indeed, impala were more likely to encounter cattle herds and their herdsmen towards the afternoon. The study augments understanding of behavioural flexibility, potential for habituation and adaptation to human-induced habitat alterations in impala and highlights a possible function of rangelands as dispersal corridors for African wildlife populations.","[Wronski, T.; Plath, M.] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Bariyanga, J.

These costs are influenced by a suite of environmental variables, operating at several temporal and spatial scales. Here, I measured prey availability, distance to forest cover, cloud cover, and wind speed, in addition to human and shorebird densities to examine how human presence affected habitat choice, relative to these environmental variables, at Pachena Beach, British Columbia. In a standardised experiment, I also approached feeding flocks to determine if environmental factors influenced the time take for shorebirds to resume feeding. Binary logistic models suggested that people did not displace shorebirds. Instead, shorebirds were preferentially selecting areas further from forest cover that may have had lower predation risk. The time taken for shorebirds to resume feeding after a human disturbance was greater in the morning and in areas of low prey availability. This suggests that shorebirds respond more to a disturbance when the foraging cost is lower indicating that behavioural responses may not necessarily reflect the potential fitness costs of human disturbance.

Therefore, choice of sleeping sites would be predicted to incorporate predator-avoidance strategies. The current study, conducted in two national parks in southern India, examined the behaviors adopted by bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata) to reduce the risk of being preyed upon while sleeping. Bonnet macaques from an urban setting with a low predatory risk were included for comparison. The physical characteristics of the sleeping sites in the forest corresponded with features that were most difficult for predators to access; bonnet macaques selected emergent trees with high boles near human settlements. These trees typically overhung water. Within the canopy, individuals slept in huddled subgroups near the terminal ends of branches, preferentially selecting branches over water. Subgroups were generally composed of members of the same age and sex, which likely promoted social bonding. Adult males and females with infants selected branches higher than members of other age and sex categories. The lateral distances of individuals along branches from the main trunk were similar across demographic categories. The size of a subgroup appeared to be limited by the weight a branch could supports lateral distances were maintained by regulation of mean subgroup weight, with heavier individuals forming smaller subgroups. The urban troop slept on the top of a building. Subgroup compositions at the urban site were similar to those at the forest sites. However, subgroup size, not restricted by branch fragility, resulted in larger subgroups than those found in the forest. Our results indicate that bonnet macaques adopted a suite of behaviors that reduced their risk of being preyed upon at night by selecting sleeping sites that minimized predator encounters and by selecting the safest locations within the canopy.","Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, New Haven, CT 06504 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Livermore, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Ecol, Livermore, CA 95616 USA",,"Ramakrishnan, U (corresponding author), Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, 123 Huntington St,Box 1106, New Haven, CT 06504 USA.",,,"Coss, Richard/0000-0002-7981-8862",,,,44,31,34,0,21,JAPAN MONKEY CENTRE,INUYAMA AICHI,"PRIMATES, EDITORIAL OFFICE, INUYAMA AICHI, 484, JAPAN",0032-8332,,,PRIMATES,Primates,JUL,2001,42,3,,,,,193,206,,10.1007/BF02629636,,,14,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Zoology,469LC,WOS:000170816000003,,,,,2022-04-19,

Some species or populations, however, deviate from the predictions. These deviations may be due to a disequilibrium between evolutionary causes and behavioural adaptations, caused by recent human changes of the environment. The relationship between human habitat alteration and primate social behaviour is reviewed and investigated for langurs. Provisioning affects the spatial distribution of food. In these areas, but also in areas with natural monopolizable food sources, female dominance relationships are linear, but not nepotistic. This does not fit into the evolutionary model. Provisioning also affects the temporal distribution of food. This reduces the seasonality of mating, increases female monopolizability and gives rise to more one-male groups than in undisturbed areas. A human reduction of the number of predators leads to fewer males per group. It also results in female philopatry. Infanticide risk was higher in disturbed than in undisturbed areas. This was not caused by the lower proportion of one-male groups in disturbed areas, but by the lack of female dispersal. Thus, female behaviour was affected by human habitat disturbance in a way that does not fit the socioecological model. However, the extension of habitat disturbance does not explain all results. We could say that the model is refuted. Phylogenetic constraints, however, do explain the behaviour of despotic Hanuman langurs. Such phylogenetic constraints complement the socioecological model. To understand the evolutionary history of a current set of features, these two approaches should be studied simultaneously.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Ethol & Socioecol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Sterck, EHM (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Ethol & Socioecol, POB 80086, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands.",e.h.m.sterck@biol.ruu.nl,"Sterck, Elisabeth/C-1063-2011","Sterck, Elisabeth/0000-0003-1101-6027",,,,82,25,30,5,23,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0032-8332,1610-7365,,PRIMATES,Primates,JAN,1999,40,1,,,,,199,213,,10.1007/BF02557711,,,15,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Zoology,163YY,WOS:000078435600015,23179541,,,,2022-04-19,

Yet the recent trend toward a holistic approach to ecological risk assessment suggests that a rigorous paradigm should be applied to toxicants, from hazard identification to risk characterization. Recent discussions have recognized that an up-front problem formulation phase is more critical in ecological risk assessment than it is for human health risk assessment. In this article a modified environmental health risk assessment paradigm is used to examine the risk of lead to birds. This risk analysis is largely conceptual, based on laboratory and field data, and incorporates information currently available. The model expands the hazard identification phase to create a target identification phase that includes the identification of receptors, endpoints, relationships, spatial and temporal scales, and indicators. The target identification phase is unique to the particular hazard, species, population, or community being examined. Lead can cause mortality, or can indirectly affect populations through effects on the food base, avian behavior, reproductive success, and recruitment, lead can (1) decrease the abundance and availability of prey, (2) bioaccumulate in prey causing increased lead toxicosis in predators, or (3) increase prey availability by interfering with its hiding or escape behavior. Moreover, lower abundance of prey can lead to starvation or nutrient deficiencies, which amplify the absorption and retention or lead. lead also causes decreases in clutch and egg size, mortality of embryos and nestlings, depression of growth, and deficits in behavior that affect survival. Lead decreases migratory behavior, and increases vulnerability to cold stress, hunters, and other predators. Research needs for evaluating the risk of lead in birds include obtaining data on (1) metal dynamics within various tissues as a function of dose and time since initial exposure, (2) low-level effects on embryos, (3) effects on chick following fledging and in the period prior to recruitment, (4) effects on adult foraging skills and reproductive behavior, and (5) the relationship between effects from exposure in the laboratory and those from exposure in the wild. This latter point is extremely important, particularly if wild birds have other means of ridding the body of lead nor available or less apparent to laboratory birds.","RUTGERS STATE UNIV, INST ENVIRONM & OCCUPAT HLTH SCI, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",,"BURGER, J (corresponding author), RUTGERS STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, GRAD PROGRAM ECOL & EVOLUT, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA.",,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P42ES005955] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIEHS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [ES05022, ES05955] Funding Source: Medline",,,140,75,80,0,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0098-4108,,,J TOXICOL ENV HEALTH,J.

We characterized their nocturnal behavior and analyzed the influence of ecological factors such as group size, season, and habitat use. Giraffe were observed using night vision systems and thermal imaging cameras on Okapuka Ranch, Namibia. A total of 77 giraffe were observed during 24 nights over two distinct periods-July-August 2016 (dry season) and February-March 2017 (wet season). Photoperiod had a marked influence on their activity and moving behavior. At dusk, giraffe reduced the time spent moving and increasingly lay down and slept at the onset of darkness. Body postures that likely correspond to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep posture (RSP) were observed 15.8 +/- 18.3 min after giraffe sat down. Season had a significant effect with longer RSP phases during the dry season (dry: 155.2 +/- 191.1 s, n = 79; wet: 85.8 +/- 94.9 s, n = 73). Further analyses of the influence of social behavior patterns did not show an effect of group size on RSP lengths. When a group of giraffe spent time at a specific resting site, several individuals were alert (vigilant) while other group members sat down or took up RSP. Simultaneous RSP events within a group were rarely observed. Resting sites were characterized by single trees or sparse bushes on open areas allowing for good visibility in a relatively sheltered location.","[Burger, Anna Lena; Dierkes, Paul W.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Biosci Educ & Zoo Biol, Max Von Laue Str 13, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Fennessy, Julian; Fennessy, Stephanie] Giraffe Conservat Fdn, Windhoek, Namibia; [Fennessy, Julian] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Burger, AL (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Biosci Educ & Zoo Biol, Max Von Laue Str 13, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",burger@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Dierkes, Paul/M-4176-2019","Dierkes, Paul/0000-0002-6046-6406; Burger, Dr. Anna Lena/0000-0001-8621-4509",,,,69,10,10,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Ecological studies of invertebrate predator-prey systems have indicated that the body size, swimming behavior, and population density of both predator and prey are important components influencing predation risk. However, weighing the relative contribution of predation risk factors, the manner in which they interact, and their responses to toxicant exposure requires multi-species predator-prey systems which consider both empirical measures of predator efficiency as well as the behavior of predator and prey. The effect of pentachlorophenol (PCP) on the vulnerability of six herbivorous freshwater rotifer species to predation by the predatory rotifer Asplanchna girodi was studied. Prey species were exposed to sublethal concentrations of PCP (0, 110, 190, and 330 mu g/l) for 30 min. Predator-prey encounters and prey ingestions were quantified for each species and PCP concentration. In addition, a computer tracking system was used to assess the effects of PCP on the swimming speed of each species. Regression models indicated a relationship between predator-prey encounters and both prey body size and prey swimming speed. However, swimming speed was dependent upon body size. The number of prey ingested was only slightly dependent upon the frequency of predator-prey encounters. Responses to PCP exposure Varied between species, and the relationships between different indices of predation risk became less apparent after PCP exposure. Our results indicate that predator-prey interactions are responsive measures of toxicant exposure and provide ecological insight into how toxicants modify predator-prey interactions and zooplankton community structure.

Therefore, FCOY may avoid areas frequented by adult males during the mating season. The main aim of this study was to identify landscape features (i.e., structure, composition, and human footprint) that may differentiate the habitat use of FCOY in the small bear population of the Cantabrian Mountains (northwestern Spain; 2001-2016) from (a) areas frequented by females with yearlings, because older cubs are at less risk of infanticide than cubs-of-the-year, and (b) bear mating areas (i.e., the riskiest areas for FCOY because of the presence of adult males). During the first months after den emergence (Apr-Jun), FCOY settled in the roughest areas of the Cantabrian Mountains at most spatial scales. This settlement pattern might represent a behavioral adaptation of FCOY to reduce the risk of encounters with males during the mating season. However, FCOY also settled in similar landscapes to those used by adult bears during the mating season, which may increase the likelihood of risky encounters. Indeed, we observed a spatial overlap between observed locations of FCOY and mating areas, which may help explain the high frequency of infanticide observed in the Cantabrian Mountains. We hypothesize that the need for both shelter and food in early spring may 'trap' FCOY in otherwise favorable areas that overlap with mating areas. This may occur predominately in small and confined bear populations, such as the one in the Cantabrian Mountains, where a restricted range and limited habitat availability might prevent FCOY from avoiding risky areas successfully.","[Penteriani, Vincenzo; Zarzo-Arias, Alejandra; Delgado, Maria del Mar; Dalerum, Fredrick] CSIC UO PA, Res Unit Biodivers UMIB, Campus Mieres, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Dalerum, Fredrick] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dalerum, Fredrick] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Gurarie, Eliezer] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Peon Torre, Paloma; Sanchez Corominas, Teresa; Vazquez, Victor M.] Consejeria Desarrollo Rural & Recursos Nat, Oviedo 33005, Spain; [Vazquez, Victor M.] Real Inst Estudios Asturianos RIDEA, Oviedo 33005, Spain; [Vazquez Garcia, Pablo] Univ Valencia, Inst Cavanilles Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Valencia 46980, Spain; [Ordiz, Andres] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway",,"Penteriani, V (corresponding author), CSIC UO PA, Res Unit Biodivers UMIB, Campus Mieres, Mieres 33600, Spain.",v.penteriani@csic.es,"Zarzo-Arias, Alejandra/AAT-5513-2021","Zarzo-Arias, Alejandra/0000-0001-5496-0144; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457; PEON TORRE, PALOMA/0000-0002-8439-8225","Excellence Project - Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) [CGL2017-82782-P]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER, EU); International Association for Bear Research and Management (IBA) [IBA-RG_16_2016]","We specially thank D.

AD likely mirrors the effort invested into vigilance, while FID provides an estimate of the perceived risk of an approaching threat. Although individual variation in AD and FID is influenced by environmental factors such as variation in predation pressure and human disturbance, the repeatabilities of these traits (especially AD), and therefore their designation as personality traits, remain under-investigated. Here, we studied the repeatability of AD, FID, and the decision to flee in a flightless, ground-breeding seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). A single experimenter approached three times over three consecutive days 47 incubating king penguins from two different colonies with varying human disturbance levels. We explored the effects of weather, time of day, and approach speed of the experimenter on these behaviors. Weather had an effect on all three behaviors. In warm, sunny weather AD increased. In rainy, windy weather birds were more likely to flee, but waited longer before initiating flight. Faster approach speeds between AD and FID increased FID. Weather conditions and speed of approach affected repeatability estimates, highlighting the need to consider external sources of variation when refining such estimates. FID and the decision to flee were significantly and moderately repeatable (r = 0.26 and 0.57, respectively), while AD was not. There was no evidence of behavioral habituation or sensitization in either colony.","[Hammer, Tracey L.; Saraux, Claire; Gineste, Benoit; Robin, Jean-Patrice; Groscolas, Rene; Viblanc, Vincent A.] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, UMR 7178, Strasbourg, France; [Bize, Pierre] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Gineste, Benoit] IPEV Inst Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor, Plouzane, France",,"Hammer, TL (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, UMR 7178, Strasbourg, France.",tracey.hammer@iphc.cnrs.fr,,"Hammer, Tracey/0000-0003-3185-4909; Viblanc, Vincent/0000-0002-4953-659X; robin, jean-patrice/0000-0002-9500-2724",Institut Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor; Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique,Institut Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor; Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique,,123,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,APR,2022,128,4,,,,,303,316,,10.1111/eth.13264,,JAN 2022,14,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,ZO0BE,WOS:000746201000001,,,,,2022-04-19,

A key measure of escape response is flight-initiation distance (FID), the distance at which a prey animal initiates its escape when approached by a potential predator. We tested the predictions of optimal escape theory by determining the factors that influence FID of bird species in a Nigerian reserved area and its surrounding habitats, and so the potential utility of FID in managing human disturbance on birds, for the first time within a West African context. We tested how FID varied with group size, proximity to vegetation acting as protective cover, levels of human use, and survival rate, and whether these relationships varied by species. We collected 504 FIDs for seven bird species in Amurum Forest Reserve and its surrounding habitats (Jos, Nigeria). The FID was lower in larger groups and when species were closer to protective cover. The FID was lower outside of the protected area because animals in sites with higher levels of human presence and use may become habituated. The FID was higher for species with higher survival, being consistent with predictions from life history theory. Overall, birds perceived humans as a potential threat and responded in accordance to the predictions of optimal escape theory, with FID increasing with increased cost of staying. Reserve managers in Africa could use species- and context-specific FIDs to designate buffer distances for the protection of wildlife from human disturbance.","[Braimoh, Bukola; Chaskda, Adams; Ajang, Afan; Cresswell, Will] Univ Jos, AP Leventis Ornithol Res Inst, Jos, Nigeria; [Braimoh, Bukola] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Anim Demog Unit, Cape Town, South Africa; [Iwajomo, Soladoye] Univ Lagos, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Akoka, Yaba, Nigeria; [Wilson, Mark] Univ Stirling, British Trust Ornithol, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Cresswell, Will] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Biol Divers, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland",,"Braimoh, B (corresponding author), Univ Jos, AP Leventis Ornithol Res Inst, Jos, Nigeria.; Braimoh, B (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Anim Demog Unit, Cape Town, South Africa.",godsbatlax@yahoo.ca,"Azaki, Bukola Debola Aderewa/AAP-1417-2021; Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013","Azaki (Nee Braimoh), Bukola D.A./0000-0002-4443-0809; Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624; Iwajomo, Soladoye/0000-0003-2486-0622",SCCS Miriam Rothschild Travel Bursary Programme; Leventis Conservation Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the AP Leventis Ornithological Research Institute (APLORI) for help with logistics.

We examined the behavioral responses of nesting female Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) to human disturbance using both experimental and observational approaches. From April to August 2006 and 2007, we monitored Northern Cardinal nests in 18 riparian forests in Ohio, USA. Two experimental trials were conducted at each nest (N = 63), with Flight Initiation Distance (FID, the distance at which a bird flushed from the nest) recorded as we approached nests by walking directly toward them and by walking along trails located variable distances from nests. We also measured flight initiation distance (FID) when nests were approached during routine nest checks (N = 160). Cardinals were six times more likely to flush when nests were approached directly, and females on higher nests were less likely to flush regardless of distance to trail. FID was not significantly influenced by the distance of nests from trails. We found no association between nest survival and the tendency of birds to flush. Rather, nest survival was best explained by nest height. Thus, our findings suggest that the responses of birds to human use of recreational trails have only short-term effects, with no apparent effects of on nest survival. Because the reaction of birds to humans in our study depended on how nests were approached, studies where FID is used as an indicator of sensitivity to human disturbance and is determined by direct approaches may overestimate the potential impact of trails on nesting birds.","[Smith-Castro, Jennifer R.; Rodewald, Amanda D.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Smith-Castro, JR (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, 4625 Morse Rd,Suite 104, Columbus, OH 43230 USA.",jennifer_smith-castro@fws.gov,"Rodewald, Amanda/D-2038-2012; Rodewald, Amanda D/I-6308-2016","Rodewald, Amanda D/0000-0002-6719-6306","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0340879, DEB-0639429]; Ohio Division of Wildlife; Ohio Agriculture and Research Development Center; Ohio State University's School of Environment and Natural Resources; GradRoots (SENR)","We are grateful for funding support from the National Science Foundation (DEB-0340879 and DEB-0639429 to ADR), Ohio Division of Wildlife, Ohio Agriculture and Research Development Center, The Ohio State University's School of Environment and Natural Resources, and GradRoots (SENR).

Anthropogenic habitats provide an opportunity to document both predation events and foraging activity by prey and therefore enable an empirical evaluation of how prey cope with trade-offs between starvation and predation risk in environments of variable foraging opportunities and predation danger. Here, we use seven years of observational data of peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus and shorebirds at a semi-intensive shrimp farm to determine how starvation and predation risk vary for shorebirds under a predictable variation in foraging opportunities. Attack rate (mean 0.1 attacks/hr, equating 1 attack every ten hours) was positively associated with the total foraging area available for shorebirds at the shrimp farm throughout the harvesting period, with tidal amplitude at the adjacent mudflat having a strong nonlinear (quadratic) effect. Hunt success (mean 14%) was higher during low tides and declined as the target flocks became larger. Finally, individual shorebird vigilance behaviors were more frequent when birds foraged in smaller flocks at ponds with poorer conditions. Our results provide empirical evidence of a risk threshold modulated by tidal conditions at the adjacent wetlands, where shorebirds trade-off risk and rewards to decide to avoid or forage at the shrimp farm (a potentially dangerous habitat) depending on their need to meet daily energy requirements. We propose that semi-intensive shrimp farms serve as ideal arenas for studying predator-prey dynamics of shorebirds and falcons, because harvest operations and regular tidal cycles create a mosaic of foraging patches with predictable food supply. In addition, the relatively low hunt success suggests that indirect effects associated with enhanced starvation risk are important in shorebird life-history decisions.","[Basso, Enzo; Navedo, Juan G.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Bird Ecol Lab, Valdivia, Chile; [Basso, Enzo] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Programa Doctorado Ecol & Evoluc, Valdivia, Chile; [Drever, Mark C.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Pacific Wildlife Res Ctr, Delta, BC, Canada; [Fonseca, Juanita] Univ Autonoma Sinaloa, Fac Ciencias Mar, Mazatlan, Mexico; [Fonseca, Juanita] Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network Exec, Manomet, Mazatlan, Mexico",,"Navedo, JG (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Bird Ecol Lab, Valdivia, Chile.",jgnavedo@uach.cl,,"Fonseca, Juanita/0000-0002-1626-6829; Drever, Mark/0000-0001-5303-9230",Environment and Climate Change Canada,This study was funded by Environment and Climate Change Canada through annual grants to JGN,,58,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

On the other hand, individuals can be very consistent in their antipredator responses, with shy individuals showing greater degree of responsiveness than bold individuals. However, the link between habituation or boldness and individual benefits has not been thoroughly investigated. We established whether and how two behavioral components associated with antipredator responses (habituation and boldness, and their interaction) would influence body condition, which is a parameter related to fitness. We conducted an outdoor semi-natural experiment with Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica). Individual boldness was consistent across contexts, but we did not find any effect of boldness or the interaction between boldness and habituation on body condition. However, those individuals that habituated more readily to a frequent predatory stimulus were able to increase their body condition more relative to lizards that habituated less. This finding highlights the importance of individual differences in behavioral plasticity, which could influence traits related to fitness. Habituation can provide benefits for individuals exposed to low-risk predators; however, individuals more prone to habituation could also experience mortality costs by wrongly habituating to a dangerous predator.","[Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Rodriguez-Prieto, Inaki; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain",,"Fernandez-Juricic, E (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 915 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",efernan@purdue.edu,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998",Spanish National Research Council (CSIC);  [MCI-CGL 2008-02119],We thank El Ventorrillo MNCN Field Station for the use of their facilities.

These human-related disturbances on animals may induce behavioural and physiological changes that can ultimately affect their fitness, showing a similar anti-predator response that against natural predator or other threats. Here, we combine the use of behavioural and physiological approaches to assess the potential effect of winter human activities on a threatened farmland bird in Europe, the pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata). We compared before, during and after weekend variations in human activity rates, pin-tailed sandgrouse behaviour (flocking and flying behaviour, interspecific association in mixed flocks and habitat use) and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. Human disturbances, in particular those associated with hunting activities, peaked during weekends. Sandgrouse showed significant behavioural changes (increased sandgrouse-only flock sizes, increased proportion of birds flying and changes in habitat use) during weekends and higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations after the weekends compared with during or before weekends. Therefore, physiological stress levels could be modulated by behavioural adjustments such as increased flock sizes and changes in habitat use that may allow sandgrouse to cope with increased human disturbance rates during weekends. Nevertheless, temporal and spatial organization of hunting days among groups of estates might be good strategies to buffer these potential adverse effects on wintering pin-tailed sandgrouse and other steppe species of conservation concern, while preserving a socio-economically important activity such as hunting.","[Casas, Fabian] EEZA CSIC, Carretera Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Casas, Fabian; Benitez-Lopez, Ana; Vinuela, Javier; Garcia, Jesus T.; Mougeot, Francois] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Casas, Fabian] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Tarjuelo, Rocio; Morales, Manuel B.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, TEG, Madrid, Spain; [Barja, Isabel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Unidad Zool, Madrid, Spain",,"Casas, F (corresponding author), EEZA CSIC, Carretera Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.; Casas, F (corresponding author), CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.; Casas, F (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",fabian.casas@eeza.csic.es,"Casas, Fabian/AAE-9846-2020; Casas, Fabian/Y-3021-2018; Tarjuelo, Rocío/ABG-9983-2020; Morales, Manuel B./B-1448-2014; Benítez López, Ana/O-3396-2014; Mougeot, Francois/B-1894-2009; Mougeot, Francois/Y-9569-2019","Casas, Fabian/0000-0003-3662-6585; Casas, Fabian/0000-0003-3662-6585; Tarjuelo, Rocío/0000-0002-0638-1911; Benítez López, Ana/0000-0002-6432-1837; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275; Mougeot, Francois/0000-0002-5819-6275; Vinuela, Javier/0000-0002-8916-0398","Direccion General de InvestigacionSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2007-429 66322/BOS, CGL2008-04282/BOS]; Consejeria de Educacion y Ciencia de Castilla-La Mancha [PAI08-0171-9582, PAC06-137]; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid [CCG10-UAM/AMB-5325]; Spanish Ministry of ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2008-04282/BOS, CGL2009-13029/BOS]; REMEDINAL2 network of the CAM [S-2009/AMB/1783]; Andalucia Talent Hub Program; JAE-Doc contract - CSIC; European Social Fund (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF); Spanish Ministry of Education (FPU-grant) [AP2009-0762]; UCLM [2012-BIN-4462]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions (COFUND-Grant) [291780]; Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment of the Junta de Andalucia; Comunidad de MadridComunidad de Madrid","We thank A.

A cultural model is a simplified way of understanding a complex system, shared by members of a culture. Eighty-eight percent of respondents understood Pfiesteria using one of four previously existing cultural models: a disease in fish, a parasite in fish, a water pollutant, and a toxin or poison. These models are not used by marine biologists, who are more likely to refer to Pfiesteria taxonomically or, in its fish killing form, to call it a predator. Our survey shows that the cultural model a respondent holds is correlated significantly with his or her believed pathway of human harm (e.g., eating fish versus swimming) and is correlated significantly but weakly with his or her behavioral responses. We conclude that existing cultural models, as the public has applied them to Pfiesteria, have led people to avoid a range of coastal activities and seafoods, in virtually all cases unnecessarily. Cultural models appear to explain public reaction better than previously hypothesized factors such as inaccurate media coverage. These findings suggest an approach to developing a pedagogical and communications strategy which could provide the public with a cultural model better matched to Pfiesteria.","Univ Delaware, Coll Marine Studies, Newark, DE 19716 USA; Univ Delaware, Sea Grant Coll Pharm, Newark, DE 19716 USA",,"Kempton, W (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Coll Marine Studies, Robinson Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",,"Kempton, Willett M/H-5176-2012","Kempton, Willett M/0000-0002-7284-8954",,,,16,23,23,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0892-0753,,,COAST MANAGE,Coast.

The effects of trapping on animals' risk perception are not often studied, although nonlethal effects of risk can significantly influence animals' behavior and distribution. We used a combination of experimental (giving-up densities: GUDs) and behavioral (vigilance rates) measures to gauge monkeys' perceived risk before and after a short livetrapping period aimed at ear-tagging monkeys for individual recognition as part of ongoing research. Two groups of arboreal samango monkeys, Cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi, showed aversion to capture in the form of generalized, group-level trap shyness after 2 individuals per group were cage trapped. We predicted that trapping would increase monkeys' antipredatory behavior in trap vicinity and raise their GUDs and vigilance rates. However, live-capture led to no perceptible changes in monkeys' use of space, vigilance, or exploitation of experimental food patches. Height above ground and experience with the experiment were the strongest predictors of monkeys' GUDs. By the end of the experiment, monkeys were depleting patches to low levels at ground and tree heights despite the trapping perturbation, whereas vigilance rates remained constant. The presence of cage traps, reintroduced in the final 10 days of the experiment, likewise had no detectable influence on monkeys' perceived risk. Our findings, consistent for both groups, are relevant for research that uses periodic live-capture to mark individuals subject to long-term study and more generally to investigations of animals' responses to human interventions.","[Nowak, Katarzyna; Hill, Russell A.] Univ Durham, Evolutionary Anthropol Res Grp, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Nowak, Katarzyna; le Roux, Aliza] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-9866 Qwaqwa, Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa; [Richards, Shane A.] Univ Durham, Dept Biol & Biomed Sci, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Hill, Russell A.] Lajuma Res Ctr, Primate & Predator Project, POB 522, ZA-0920 Makhado, South Africa",,"Nowak, K (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Evolutionary Anthropol Res Grp, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3LE, England.; Nowak, K (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-9866 Qwaqwa, Phuthaditjhaba, South Africa.",knowak02@gmail.com,"Hill, Russell/D-9113-2013; le Roux, Aliza/Y-3541-2019; Nowak, Katarzyna/AAT-5468-2021","Hill, Russell/0000-0002-7601-5802; Richards, Shane/0000-0002-9638-5827; Nowak, Katarzyna/0000-0002-4992-7910",Claude Leon Foundation; Durham University; Earthwatch,"We thank I.

The risk-disturbance hypothesis predicts that animals exhibit risk-avoidance behaviours when exposed to human disturbance because they perceive the disturbance as a predatory threat. Aims. This study aimed to examine whether Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsoni) exhibit risk-avoidance behaviour with proximity to a major highway and with increasing traffic flow consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis. Methods. Focal-animal sampling was used to observe the behaviour of Tibetan antelopes. The behaviours were categorised as foraging, vigilance, resting, moving, or other. The time, frequency, and duration of foraging and vigilance were calculated. Key results. As distance from the road increased, time spent foraging and foraging duration increased while foraging frequency, time spent being vigilant and vigilance frequency decreased, indicating that there is a risk perception associated with roads. Tibetan antelopes presented more risk-avoidance behaviours during high-traffic periods compared with low-traffic periods. Conclusions. Tibetan antelopes exhibited risk-avoidance behaviour towards roads that varied with proximity and traffic levels, which is consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis. Implications.

There is a heritable basis to some of this variation, but the environment plays an important role in shaping individuals' risk-taking propensity as well. This chapter describes some of the challenges in studying the genetic basis of individual differences in risk-taking behavior, arguing new insights will emerge from studies which take a whole-genome approach and which simultaneously consider both genetic and environmental influences on the behavior. The availability of genomic tools for three-spined stickleback, a small fish renowned for its variable behavior, opens up new possibilities for studying the genetic basis of natural, adaptive variation in risk-taking behavior. After introducing the general biology of sticklebacks, the chapter summarizes the existing literature on the genetic and environmental influences on risk-taking behavior, and describes the overall strategy that our group is taking to identify inherited and environmentally responsive genes related to risk-taking behavior in this species. Insights gleaned from such studies will be relevant to our understanding of similar behaviors in other organisms, including ourselves.

We applied principles of patch use and foraging theory to test foraging strategies and fear responses of three strains of Mus musculus: wild-caught, control laboratory, and genetically modified strains. Foraging choices were quantified using giving-up densities (GUDs) under three foraging scenarios: (1) patches varying in microhabitat (covered versus open), and initial resource density (low versus high); (2) daily variation in auditory cues (aerial predators and control calls); (3) patches with varying seed aggregations. Overall, both domestic strains harvested significantly more food than wild mice. Each strain revealed a significant preference for foraging under cover compared to the open, and predator calls had no detectable effects on foraging. Both domestic strains biased their harvest toward high quality patches; wild mice did not. In terms of exploiting favorable and avoiding unfavorable distributions of seeds within patches, the lab strain performed best, the wild strain worst, and the mutant strain in between. Our study provides support for hypothesis that domestic animals have more energy-efficient foraging strategies than their wild counterparts, but retain residual fear responses. Furthermore, patch-use studies can reveal the aptitudes and priorities of both domestic and wild animals. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we tested whether birds' decisions about nest defence may additionally be affected by an increasing familiarity with a particular nest predator. We tested nest defence responses of great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus to a nest predator, the little bittern Ixobrychus minutus. Great reed warbler nests located close (a parts per thousand currency sign7 m) to synchronously breeding little bitterns were neighbour, other nests were solitary. Great reed warbler specific aggression towards a little bittern dummy was much lower (similar to 5-times) at neighbour than solitary nests. In contrast, generalised responses to a control innocuous intruder (the turtle dove, Streptopelia turtur) were statistically identical at neighbour and solitary nests. These patterns are in line with dynamic risk assessment hypothesis. We hypothesise that decreased great reed warbler aggression at neighbour nests also represents a specific behavioural adaptation to nesting in association with the little bittern. Little bitterns breeding closer to great reed warblers showed decreased risks of failure due to predation. However, further research is needed to experimentally test the causal links behind these patterns.","[Trnka, Alfred] Univ Trnava, Dept Biol, Trnava 91843, Slovakia; [Grim, Tomas] Palacky Univ, Dept Zool, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Grim, Tomas] Palacky Univ, Ornithol Lab, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic",,"Trnka, A (corresponding author), Univ Trnava, Dept Biol, Priemyselna 4, Trnava 91843, Slovakia.",atrnka@truni.sk,,,Human Frontier Science Program awardHuman Frontier Science Program [RGY83/12],"We are grateful to D.

In this pilot study, the scent marking behaviour of three female and five male captive stoats was observed in response to three experimental scents, two neutral and one potentially significant, introduced into their home cages. Each stoat was presented with a random sequence of three scents rubbed onto a plastic refuge tube within the cage: (1) a clean, washed tube; (2) goat odour, expected to be perceptible by the stoat but not threatening to it; (3) the body scent of male humans (because all eight stoats were accustomed to being fed by a female human carer). We observed scent marking behaviours such as tube sniffing, anal gland marking and body rubbing during all trials. When the treatment tube was rubbed with 'male human odour', stoats reacted strongly and more often, both by more vigorous anal gland marking and also by adding head-rubbing behaviours which normally convey an agonistic response. These results suggest that an extensive field trial could be justified to check whether this response might indicate the reactions of wild stoats towards traps.","[Watson, Stacey Winder; King, Carolyn M.] Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Watson, Stacey Winder] 711 Henry Watson Rd,RD1, Walton 3475, New Zealand",,"King, CM (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton, New Zealand.",carolyn.king@waikato.ac.nz,,,University of Waikato; Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour,"We are grateful to the University of Waikato and the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour for funding; to Alison Campbell, Rod McDonald, Joe Waas and the staff of the Bioengineering group, HortResearch, Animal Behaviour Welfare Research Centre for equipment and accommodation for the stoats; to Neil Cox and to the volunteers who donated their scents for the trials.",,13,1,1,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4223,1175-8821,,NEW ZEAL J ZOOL,N.

We used a systematic combination of empirical observational studies and experimental manipulations to comprehensively evaluate the effects of these process on a model endangered rodent, dusky hopping-mice (Notomys fuscus). We established a large manipulative experiment in arid Australia, and collected information from relative abundance indices, camera traps, GPS-collared dingoes (Canis familiaris) and dingo scats, along with a range of related environmental data (e.g. rainfall, habitat type, distance to artificial water etc.). We show that hopping-mice populations were most strongly influenced by geological and climatic effects of resource availability and rainfall, and not land use, invasive species, or human effects of livestock grazing, waterpoint provision, or the lethal control of dingoes. Hopping-mice distribution declined along a geological gradient of more to less available hopping-mice habitat (sand dunes), and their abundance was driven by rainfall. Hopping-mice populations fluctuated independent of livestock presence, artificial waterpoint availability or repeated lethal dingo control. Hopping-mice populations appear to be limited first by habitat availability, then by food availability, then by predation. Contemporary top-predator control practices (for protection of livestock) have little influence on hopping-mice behaviour or population dynamics. Given our inability to constrain the effects of predation across broad scales, management actions focusing on increasing available food and habitat (e.g. alteration of fire and herbivory) may have a greater chance of improving the conservation status of hopping-mice and other small mammals in arid areas. Our study also reaffirms the importance of using systematic and experimental approaches to detect true drivers of population distribution and dynamics where multiple potential drivers operate simultaneously.

The poachers imitate animal calls to feign the presence of eagles or leopards, two predators to which monkeys react with high calling rates and approach. In the presence of humans, monkeys become silent and move off. A small area of the park is now avoided by poachers, due to the establishment of a field project on chimpanzees in 1979. This offered the opportunity to investigate whether sudden changes in predation pressure lead to a rapid alteration in prey behaviour. Playback experiments, using groups of Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana, as subjects, revealed that the poachers' strategy works well in the home range of the habituated chimpanzee group. However, monkeys which are frequently exposed to poachers are rarely footed by the imitations.

Predators often reproduce at specific sites over many years causing permanent threats to local prey species. Such prey may respond by moving elsewhere thereby reducing local population abundance, or they may stay put and adjust their behavior to the presence of predators. We tested these predictions by analyzing population abundance and anti-predator behavior within 100 m of and 500 m away from nests of sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus and goshawks A. gentilis for 80 species of birds. Population abundance of prey was reduced by 11% near goshawk nests and by 15% near sparrowhawk nests when compared with nearby control sites in similar habitats. Flight initiation distance (FID) of prey, estimated as the distance at which birds took flight when approached by a human, increased by 50% in the presence of hawk nests, providing evidence of adjustment of anti-predator behavior to prevailing risks of predation. Susceptibility to predation was estimated as log transformed abundance of the observed number of prey items obtained from prey remains collected around nests minus log transformed expected number of prey according to point counts of breeding birds. FID increased from 10 to 46 m with increasing susceptibility of prey species to predation by the goshawk and from 12 to 15 m with increasing susceptibility of prey species to predation by the sparrowhawk. These findings suggest that prey adjust their distribution and anti-predator behavior to the risk of predation.","[Moller, Anders.

How this state of affairs has evolved has generated wide debate. The thrifty gene hypothesis was the first attempt to explain obesity as a consequence of adaptive responses to an ancient environment that in modern society become disadvantageous. The idea is that genes (or more precisely, alleles) predisposing to obesity may have been selected for by repeated exposure to famines. However, this idea has many flaws: for instance, selection of the supposed magnitude over the duration of human evolution would fix any thrifty alleles (famines kill the old and young, not the obese) and there is no evidence that hunter-gatherer populations become obese between famines. An alternative idea (called thrifty late) is that selection in famines has only happened since the agricultural revolution. However, this is inconsistent with the absence of strong signatures of selection at single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to obesity. In parallel to discussions about the origin of obesity, there has been much debate regarding the regulation of body weight. There are three basic models: the setpoint, settling point and dual-intervention point models. Selection might act against low and high levels of adiposity because food unpredictability and the risk of starvation selects against low adiposity whereas the risk of predation selects against high adiposity. Although evidence for the latter is quite strong, evidence for the former is relatively weak. The release from predation similar to 2-million years ago is suggested to have led to the upper intervention point drifting in evolutionary time, leading to the modern distribution of obesity: the drifty gene hypothesis. Recent critiques of the dual-intervention point/drifty gene idea are flawed and inconsistent with known aspects of energy balance physiology. Here, I present a new formulation of the dual-intervention point model. This model includes the novel suggestion that food unpredictability and starvation are insignificant factors driving fat storage, and that the main force driving up fat storage is the risk of disease and the need to survive periods of pathogen-induced anorexia. This model shows why two independent intervention points are more likely to evolve than a single set point. The molecular basis of the lower intervention point is likely based around the leptin pathway signalling. Determining the molecular basis of the upper intervention point is a crucial key target for future obesity research. A potential definitive test to separate the different models is also described.","[Speakman, John R.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Speakman, John R.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland",,"Speakman, JR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Speakman, JR (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland.",J.speakman@abdn.ac.uk,"John, Speakman/A-9494-2008","John, Speakman/0000-0002-2457-1823",Chinese Academy of Sciences Xiandao B eGPS project [XDB13030100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China microevolution programNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC91431102]; 1000 talents program; Wolfson merit Professorship from the UK Royal Society,"My work on body weight regulation has been generously supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Xiandao B eGPS project (XDB13030100), the National Natural Science Foundation of China microevolution program (NSFC91431102), the 1000 talents program and a Wolfson merit Professorship from the UK Royal Society.",,334,37,37,5,27,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

We used blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI to test whether amphetamine sensitization (1 mg/kg, i.p. x3 days) in female rats has a lasting effect on the neural response to a stress-evoking stimulus, the scent of a predator, during the postpartum period. The subiculum and dopamine-enriched midbrain VTA/SN of amphetamine-sensitized but not control mothers showed a greater BOLD signal response to predator odor than a control putrid scent. The greater responsiveness of these two brain regions following stimulant sensitization might impact neural processing in response to stressors in the maternal brain. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This information is crucial to reduce the number of predator attacks, which in absolute terms have increased in the last decades. Here, we focus on the role of carnivore species and sex, as well as victim-related factors (i.e. gender, activities, party composition), as determinants of carnivore attacks on humans. Using a dataset on attacks by grizzlies (Ursus arctos horribilis), black bears (Ursus americanus), cougars (Puma concolor), wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) in North America during the last five decades, we found that (1) male black bears were involved in attacks more frequently than females; (2) attacks by coyotes, cougars and wolves prevalently caused injuries, whereas cases of death were more frequent during grizzly and black bear attacks; and (3) people in a party were less vulnerable to an attack than a person alone. We identified risky situations and behaviours that should be avoided in areas where people and large carnivore share the landscape.","[Jose Garrote, Pedro; Fedriani, Jose M.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves CEABN InBIO, Lisbon, Portugal; [Jose Garrote, Pedro; Fedriani, Jose M.; Penteriani, Vincenzo] CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Conservat Biol, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville, Spain; [del Mar Delgado, Maria; Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose; Penteriani, Vincenzo] Oviedo Univ, UO CSIC PA, UMIB, Res Unit Biodivers, Campus Mieres, Mieres, Spain; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Bombieri, Giulia] Univ Torino, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Turin, Italy",,"Garrote, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves CEABN InBIO, Lisbon, Portugal.; Garrote, PJ; Penteriani, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Conservat Biol, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville, Spain.; Penteriani, V (corresponding author), Oviedo Univ, UO CSIC PA, UMIB, Res Unit Biodivers, Campus Mieres, Mieres, Spain.",garrotegarcia88@gmail.com; penteriani@ebd.csic.es,"Bombieri, Giulia/W-9305-2019; Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018","Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621",Portuguese FCT grantPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [IF/00728/2013]; Spanish 'Ramon y Cajal' grantSpanish Government [RYC-2014-16263]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [JCI-2012-13066],PJGG and JMF were funded by a Portuguese FCT grant (IF/00728/2013).

These potentially negative effects become even more problematic when dealing with threatened or endangered species, such as the Mojave Desert tortoise (Copherus agassizii). We addressed three concerns regarding use of dogs trained to locate desert tortoises in the wild. First, we looked at the potential for dogs to attract native and non-native predators to sites at a greater rate than with human visitation alone by comparing presence of predator sign before and after visitation by dogs and by humans. We found no significant difference in predator sign based upon type of surveyor. Second, we looked at the difference in risk of predation to desert tortoises that were located in the wild by humans versus humans with wildlife-detector dogs. Over a 5-week period, during which tortoises were extensively monitored and a subsequent period of 1 year during which tortoises were monitored monthly, there was no predation on, nor sign of predator-inflicted trauma to tortoises initially encountered either by humans or wildlife-detector dogs. Third, we looked at movement patterns of tortoises after encounter by either humans or wildlife-detector dogs. Movement of desert tortoises was not significantly different after being found by a human versus being found by a wildlife-detector dog. Based upon these initial results we conclude that use of trained wildlife-detector dogs to survey for desert tortoises in the wild does not appear to increase attraction of predators, increase risk of predation, or alter movement patterns of desert tortoises more than surveys conducted by humans alone.","[Heaton, Jill S.; Fracis, S.

We evaluated the effect of the presence of domestic dogs and humans on the foraging behavior of the Andean White-eared Opossum, Didelphis pernigra, in an ex-urban area in the Colombian Andes. We also studied habitat use by this marsupial using the giving-up density (GUD) technique, the amount of food left by a forager after exploiting a patch in which it experiences diminishing returns, and that informs about foraging costs experienced by an individual, including the perceived risk of predation. We measured the GUD's in experiments with the presence of dogs and/or humans in an area in natural regeneration of Andean forest and in an exotic plantation of Eucalyptus globulus near the Bogota River. The opossums used the regeneration area more than the plantation; the plantation was barely visited. Our results suggest that the opossum chose foraging sites depending on their exposure to potential predators. The human presence reduced the foraging of the opossum in the regeneration forest. In addition, their foraging also was affected by the moon's light, but this effect was modulated by the period of the night. The opossums do not seem to recognize the dog as a threat, probably increasing their vulnerability to the attack of these carnivores.","[Cortes-Alfonso, Daniela; Sanchez, Francisco] Univ Mil Nueva Granada, Fac Ciencias Basicas & Aplicadas, Grp INQUIBIO, Programa Biol Aplicada, Cajica, Colombia; [Valenzuela, Alejandro E.

However, birds have been known to feed from the hand of humans. Such behaviour must reflect the trade-off between acquisition of food and the risk of being captured by a potential predator feeding from the hand. Relying on YouTube, an international video-sharing platform, we found 36 European bird species recorded feeding from the hand of humans. We compared ecological traits between these species and all other 490 European bird species, which were not recorded as feeding from a human hand. We found that species with a large number of innovative behaviours, a higher rate of introduction success, larger breeding range, larger population size, and urban tolerance have a higher probability of feeding from the hand of a human. These associations were also supported after control for the similarity among taxa due to common phylogenetic descent. In conclusion, these findings suggest that frequent feeding from the hand of a human results in the transition from natural environments to novel urbanized environments with consequences for population size increasing and range expansion.","[Moller, Anders Pape; Xia, Canwei] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, AgroParisTech, CNRS,Ecol Systemat Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France",,"Moller, AP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Moller, AP (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, AgroParisTech, CNRS,Ecol Systemat Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France.",anders.moller@u-psud.fr,,,Chinese Ministry of Education (the 111 Project) [B13008],"J.

Prey at greater risk are predicted to have longer flight initiation distance (= distance from predator when escape begins), flee farther, be more likely to enter refuge, and have longer hiding time (= time between entering and exiting refuge). We simulated predators to study effects of risk factors in the lizard Sceloporus jarrovii. Flight initiation distance, distance fled and probability of entering refuge increased with approach speed. Flight initiation distance increased additively with increases in speed and directness of approach. Lizards habituated to human presence had shorter flight initiation distances than unhabituated lizards. As predicted from greater threat posed by a persistent predator, flight initiation distance and hiding time were longer after the second of two approaches. Fleeing was more likely when an investigator stood nearby and turned toward them than when farther way or turned away. These findings verify theoretical predictions of escape and refuge use for several risk factors and most are consistent with those for other lizards. However, speed and directness of approach had additive effects in S. jarrovii, but interacted in other species. Another novel finding was a small interaction between individual investigator and directness of approach. Although outcomes of tests of escape and refuge use theories consistently confirm qualitative predictions, quantitative comparisons between studies by different investigators may have limited value unless information is available about relative responses by prey to each investigator.","[Cooper, William E., Jr.; Avalos, Arian] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA",,"Cooper, WE (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA.",Cooperw@ipfw.edu,,"Avalos, Arian/0000-0002-4011-3099",Theodore Roosevelt grant,This work was partially support by a Theodore Roosevelt grant awarded to AA.

This collective behavior is often led by a few individuals of specific gender, social rank, or spatial physical location in the group (i.e., perimeter or front). We examined how individual social voles () in same-gender compared with mixed-gender groups respond to an owl attack. We found that anxiety level, as measured by the time that each individual spent in less-sheltered sectors (open arms of elevated plus-maze and center of open arena), was affected by both the social context and the gender of the tested individuals. While both female and male voles generally reduced their activity in the open following owl attack, males in mixed-gender groups were exceptional in dichotomizing into those that spent a short period and those that spent a long period in the open arms of the plus-maze. Based on the similar responses of the same-gender groups, we suggest that anxiety is contagious, and based on the lower anxiety level of the mixed-gender groups, we suggest that natural groups that comprise both males and females are better able to cope with life-threat compared with same-gender groups. Finally, we suggest that the differential responses of males in the mixed-gender groups were due to a few males that displayed a low level of anxiety. These males were probably individuals of high social rank, and their response reflects their natural protective role, as previously described in social voles.","[Eilam, David; Zadicario, Pazit; Genossar, Tom] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel; [Mort, Joel] USAF, Trust & Human Interact Branch, Res Lab, Dayton, OH USA",,"Eilam, D (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel.",eilam@post.tau.ac.il,,"Mort, Joel/0000-0002-7451-2434","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Air Force Material Command, USAFUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA8655-11-1-3050]","We are grateful to Mr. Daniel Galfanski and Ms. Rony Izhar for their help in experimentation and data acquisition, and to Ms. Naomi Paz for language editing.

Much of our current understanding is skewed because the ecology of sea turtles on their foraging grounds is known best from areas where there are, or have been, major human impacts. We studied green Chelonia mydas and loggerhead Caretta caretta sea turtles on the relatively pristine feeding ground of Shark Bay, Western Australia, where tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier are a major mortality agent. Recapture rates were lower for green than for loggerhead turtles, possibly reflecting a larger population rather than low site fidelity for greens. The sex ratio of loggerhead turtles was not significantly different from 1:1, whereas green turtles showed a strong female bias. Size distributions of both species were skewed towards larger (and presumably older) individuals relative to a human-impacted feeding ground in eastern Australia. Body condition varied temporally for green turtles, but not for loggerhead turtles, possibly due to longer distances traveled to nesting beaches by green turtles. Rates of shark-inflicted injuries were higher for loggerhead turtles, especially males, than for greens. Sublethal effects of these injuries were not evident. There are notable differences between sea turtles threatened primarily by tiger sharks in Shark Bay and populations on feeding grounds where historical and current mortality causes are anthropogenic.

We studied the effects of group size, habitat (shrubland steppe v. meadows), and risk of hunting by humans (protected core area v. edge area exposed to poaching) on vigilance and foraging behaviour of wild populations of the Lesser Rhea (Rhea pennata pennata), a near-threatened ratite, in north-western Patagonia, Argentina. On average, Lesser Rheas allocated 18% of their time to vigilance and 67% to foraging. Individuals tended to be more vigilant with declining group size, in areas with low visibility that hinders escape by running, and in areas exposed to hunting, than in open habitats with abundant food or sites with low risk of hunting. Although time spent foraging was also influenced by habitat type and hunting risk, there was no direct relationship between foraging time and group size. As in other species of ratite, Lesser Rheas seem to take advantage of flocking as an anti-predation strategy. Our data do not only confirm the influence of group size, but also of habitat structure and hunting risk, in determining the behaviour of this flightless bird in the wild.","[Barri, Fernando R.; Roldan, Nicolas; Navarro, Joaquin L.; Martella, Monica B.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Ctr Zool Aplicada, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina",,"Barri, FR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Ctr Zool Aplicada, CC 122, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",fbarri@efn.uncor.edu,,,Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia of the Province of Cordoba; Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica of the Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (SECyT-UNC)Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia (SECYT); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FONCYT)ANPCyTFONCyT,"We are grateful to the Estacion Experimental Agropecuaria INTA Bariloche for allowing us to conduct this work on their experimental ranch.

Adaptive maternal programming occurs when mothers alter their offspring's phenotype in response to environmental information such that it improves offspring fitness. When a mother's environment is predictive of the conditions her offspring are likely to encounter, such transgenerational plasticity enables offspring to be better-prepared for this particular environment. However, maternal effects can also have deleterious effects on fitness. 2. Here, we test whether female threespined stickleback fish exposed to predation risk adaptively prepare their offspring to cope with predators. We either exposed gravid females to a model predator or not, and compared their offspring's antipredator behaviour and survival when alone with a live predator. Importantly, we measured offspring behaviour and survival in the face of the same type of predator that threatened their mothers (Northern pike). 3. We did not find evidence for adaptive maternal programming; offspring of predator-exposed mothers were less likely to orient to the predator than offspring from unexposed mothers. In our predation assay, orienting to the predator was an effective antipredator behaviour and those that oriented survived for longer. 4. In addition, offspring from predator-exposed mothers were caught more quickly by the predator on average than offspring from unexposed mothers. The difference in antipredator behaviour between the maternal predator-exposure treatments offers a potential behavioural mechanism contributing to the difference in survival between maternal treatments. 5. However, the strength and direction of the maternal effect on offspring survival depended on offspring size. Specifically, the larger the offspring from predator-exposed mothers, the more vulnerable they were to predation compared to offspring from unexposed mothers. 6. Our results suggest that the predation risk perceived by mothers can have long-term behavioural and fitness consequences for offspring in response to the same predator. These stress-mediated maternal effects can have non-adaptive consequences for offspring when they find themselves alone with a predator. In addition, complex interactions between such maternal effects and offspring traits such as size can influence our conclusions about the adaptive nature of maternal effects.","[McGhee, Katie E.; Pintor, Lauren M.; Suhr, Elissa L.; Bell, Alison M.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"McGhee, KE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",kemcghee@illinois.edu,"Pintor, Lauren/B-6013-2013","McGhee, Katie/0000-0002-7965-5020",NIH/NICHDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [T32 HD007333]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 1121980]; University of Illinois; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH &HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [T32HD007333] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM082937] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank the Spirit Lake Fish Hatchery (Iowa) for providing the pike, the Jake Wolf Fish Hatchery (Illinois) for holding the pike, and B.

Other studies imply that the predator must have co-evolved with prey to maximize the efficacy of response. We used chemosensory cues from the urine of native and normative canines to manipulate the behavior of the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus). One-choice feeding trials were located along a distance gradient, and administered to 28 free-ranging, semiwild, western grey kangaroos. Foods closer to the chemical source (within 12 m) were less likely to be eaten than those further from the source when the urine came from a native predator, the dingo (Canis dingo). Flight behavior was more likely to be observed on occasions when the dingo urine had been presented. A lesser effect occurred (to within 6 m) when urine was presented from the normative canid (coyote [Canis latrans]), while the flight behavior occurred once. Neither human urine, nor tap-water control, had any effect. We offer the first evidence that native predator-based chemical cues affect patch selection, while increasing fear, for this herbivore.","Curtin Univ Technol, Ctr Ecosyst Divers & Dynam, Dept Environm Biol, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; Univ Plymouth, Dept Biol Sci, Newton Abbot TQ12 6NQ, Devon, England",,"Parsons, MH (corresponding author), Curtin Univ Technol, Ctr Ecosyst Divers & Dynam, Dept Environm Biol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",M.Parsons@curtin.edu.au,,"Lamont, Byron/0000-0001-9279-7149",,,,29,20,20,2,24,WILDLIFE SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2197 USA",0022-541X,,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

The saltwater crocodile Crocodylus porosus is a keystone species in mangrove wetlands but also a dangerous predator that affects people's safety and livelihoods. Although saltwater crocodiles are protected under the Myanmar Biodiversity and Protected Area Law, the government has not integrated local people's attitudes into conservation and management. As a consequence, saltwater crocodiles, although categorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, are restricted to a single protected area, Meinmahlakyun Wildlife Sanctuary, in Myanmar. To examine local attitudes towards the species, we investigated local knowledge about the environment, crocodiles, habitats and threats, awareness of human-crocodile conflict, and perceptions of the benefits and impacts of saltwater crocodile conservation through questionnaires in 244 households in 17 villages. We found that people were highly knowledgeable about the local environment, saltwater crocodiles, and their habitats. People with seasonal livelihoods that rely on natural resources from Meinmahlakyun had negative attitudes towards crocodile conservation. People were likely to have negative attitudes if they perceived there were no benefits from conserving the species. Law enforcement through restricting resource access does not enhance conservation success and builds resentment towards the conservation of the species. Local people suggested that, as a basis for management, understanding risks posed by crocodiles was the best approach to facilitate human-crocodile coexistence in the Ayeyarwady delta region.","[Than, Kay; Hughes, Alice] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Landscape Ecol Grp, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zaw, Zaw] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Int Coll, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Than, Kay] Minist Nat Resources & Environm Conservat, Watershed Management Div, Forest Dept, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar",,"Hughes, AC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Landscape Ecol Grp, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",ach_conservation2@hotmail.com,,"hughes, Alice/0000-0002-4899-3158",Southeast Asia Atlas of Biodiversity [Y5ZK121B01]; Rufford Foundation [21646-1],"We thank the villagers who participated in the interviews, the staff and rangers of Meinmahlakyun Wildlife Sanctuary for their help with fieldwork, the Forest Department of Myanmar for granting permission to conduct this research, and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Maternal experience with predators, for example, can have lifelong consequences for offspring traits, including fitness. Previous work in threespine sticklebacks showed that females exposed to simulated predation risk produced eggs with higher cortisol content and offspring with altered anti-predator behavior. However, it is unknown whether this maternal effect is mediated via the offspring glucocorticoid stress response and if it is retained over the entire lifetime of offspring. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that maternal exposure to simulated predation risk has long-lasting effects on the cortisol response to simulated predation risk in stickleback offspring. We measured circulating concentrations of cortisol before (baseline), 15 min after, and 60 min after exposure to a simulated predation risk. We compared adult offspring of predator-exposed mothers and control mothers in two different social environments (alone or in a group). Relative to baseline, offspring plasma cortisol was highest 15 mm after exposure to simulated predation risk and decreased after 60 min. Offspring of predator-exposed mothers differed in the cortisol response to simulated predation risk compared to offspring of control mothers. In general, females had higher cortisol than males, and fish in a group had lower cortisol than fish that were by themselves. The buffering effect of the social environment did not differ between maternal treatments or between males and females. Altogether the results show that while a mother's experience with simulated predation risk might affect the physiological response of her adult offspring to a predator, sex and social isolation have much larger effects on the stress response to predation risk in sticklebacks.

Although predation risk is thought to influence both the behavior and grouping patterns of most diurnal primates, evidence supporting this hypothesis is still limited. The spatial and temporal patterns of mineral lick use by one group of white-bellied spider monkeys (Ateles belzebuth) were evaluated, based on the growing evidence that mineral licks are perceived as areas of relative high predation risk by Neotropical primates. The area immediately surrounding the mineral lick was the most intensively used area within the home range of the study group, particularly by large subgroups of monkeys, and there were differences in mean subgroup size on days of mineral lick visitation versus days without lick visits. Additionally, on days of mineral lick visitation, subgroup size reached its maximum specifically during the period of lick visitation. Finally, on visit days subgroups showed a greater increase in size and higher fusion rates in the 2 hr before arriving at the lick in comparison with matched time windows on non-visit days. Together, these results provide an example of how primates employ behavioral strategies that might reduce the effects of predation. This study also demonstrates how taxa characterized by a high degree of fission-fusion dynamics can allow us to test hypotheses regarding the effects of socioecological variables on primate grouping patterns.

Except for a dose-dependent reduction in flinch/jump reactions to dorsal contact (taps), other defensive behaviors (flight, freezing, etc.) were not reliably altered by morphine treatment (0, 1.0, 2.5, 7.5 mg/kg). Vocalization responses to vibrissae stimulation in wild-trapped R. rattus were reliably increased following naloxone (1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) administration, lending support for opiate receptor involvement in the mediation of defensive vocalization. In the Anxiety/Defense Test Battery, measuring defensive reactions to situations associated with a predator (cat) or with cat odor, laboratory rats showed no decrease in defensive behavior with morphine (0, 1.0, 5.0 mg/kg). In direct contrast to the above findings, the effects of morphine treatment in this test battery suggested a generalized increase in defensiveness to noncontacting and nonpainful threat stimuli. These effects included a decrease in time spent near the cat compartment, with a complementary increase in time spent at maximum distance, a decrease in transits between these sections, an increase in crouching, and a decrease in grooming and rearing. This pattern of results suggests that morphine may have two opposing effects on defensive behavior, a generalized enhancement, together with a more specific reduction of responses to tactile or painful stimulation. A very widespread pattern of reliable sex or sex x drug effects in the Anxiety/Defense Test Battery was in good agreement with previous reports of sex differences in these tests, with females generally more defensive than males. Consonant with previous findings, no reliable sex differences were found with the Fear/Defense Test Battery, although several values approached an acceptable level of statistical significance.","UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & REPROD BIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,DEPT PSYCHOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV LEEDS,DEPT PSYCHOL,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND",,"BLANCHARD, DC (corresponding author), UNIV HAWAII,PACIFIC BIOMED RES CTR,BEKESY LAB NEUROBIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822, USA.",,,,"NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR01825, RR03061] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH42803] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH042803] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,47,37,38,0,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0091-3057,,,PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BE,Pharmacol.

Plains zebras (Equus quagga) and Grevy's zebras (E. grevyi) frequently form mixed-species groups in zones where their ranges overlap in Kenya. Although anecdotal observations suggest that Plains zebras are more flighty around humans than Grevy's zebras are, this has not been empirically confirmed, and relatively little is known about how they may influence each other's flight behavior. We addressed these questions by examining the flight initiation distances (FIDs) of Plains and Grevy's zebras in single-species and mixed-species groups from an approaching human. One target individual per group was approached steadily on foot, with start distance, alert distance, and FID recorded from this target. Using start distance and alert distance separately as covariates, 22 Plains zebras in single-species groups exhibited a significantly longer mean FID than 15 Grevy's zebras in single-species groups. The FIDs of 7 Plains zebras and 5 Grevy's zebras tested in mixed-species groups were virtually equivalent and intermediate to those of Plains and Grevy's zebras in single-species groups, suggesting a bidirectional moderating influence of heterospecifics on risk assessment. This effect was most pronounced for Plains zebras in mixed-species groups that exhibited an FID that was significantly shorter than that of Plains zebras in single-species groups.

In the present studies the behavioral effects of 8-OH-DPAT treatment (0.01-1.0 mg/kg, SC) were entirely consistent with anxiety/fear reduction. These effects included an increase in time spent near the cat compartment, and a complimentary decrease in time spent farthest from this compartment, together with an increase in transits and locomote behavior. 8-OH-DPAT (1.0 mg/kg) also increased eat frequencies and durations (highly preferred food) both during and following cat presentation, without influencing drinking. This finding is discussed with reference to previous findings with 8-OH-DPAT in studies assessing both food intake and anxiolysis. Interestingly, 8-OH-DPAT was more potent in a majority of its effects in female subjects, a finding consistent with recent neurochemical data. These findings provide important behavioral evidence for a sexual differentiation in 5-HT function, and support the case for greater emphasis on female subjects in animal models of anxiety.","UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & REPROD BIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,DEPT PSYCHOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV LEEDS,DEPT PSYCHOL,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND",,"BLANCHARD, DC (corresponding author), UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,BEKESY LAB NEUROBIOL,1993 EAST WEST RD,HONOLULU,HI 96822, USA.",,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH042803] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR01825, RR03061] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH42803] Funding Source: Medline",,,49,68,68,0,4,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,APR,1992,106,4,,,,,531,539,,10.1007/BF02244826,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,HF491,WOS:A1992HF49100016,1533722,,,,2022-04-19,

Reduced movements may further alter heterogeneity in biotic and abiotic conditions experienced by individuals. The joint action of local conditions and matrix permeability may shape emigration decisions. Here, we tested the interactive effects of predation risk and matrix permeability on movement propensity, movement costs and movers' phenotype in the common toad Bufo bufo. In a full-crossed experimental design, we assessed the movement propensity of juveniles in three connectivity treatments (from poorly to highly permeable matrix), with or without predation risk in their living patch. We also assessed the relationships between movement propensity and morphological traits (i.e. body and leg length) and how it affected the movement cost (i.e. mass loss). Movement propensity increased in presence of predation risk, while matrix permeability had no effect. However, matrix permeability interacted with predation risk to influence movers' phenotype and the physiological cost they endured while moving. In particular, a well-known movement syndrome in toads (i.e. movement propensity positively related to longer legs) depended on the interaction between matrix permeability and predation risk and resulted in differences in mass loss among matrix types. Movers lost more mass on average than residents except when they also displayed longer legs or when they crossed the most permeable matrix in the presence of predation risk. Our results show that matrix permeability shapes the physiological cost of dispersal by changing the identity of individuals moving away from local conditions. As the movers' phenotype can importantly alter (meta)population dynamics, context-dependency of dispersal syndromes should be considered in studies predicting the functioning of human-altered natural systems.","[Winandy, Laurane; Cote, Julien; Di Gesu, Lucie; Pellerin, Felix] Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, UMRS EDB 174, FR-31062 Toulouse, France; [Trochet, Audrey; Legrand, Delphine] CNRS, UMR5321, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, Moulis, France",,"Winandy, L (corresponding author), Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, UMRS EDB 174, FR-31062 Toulouse, France.",laurane.winandy@uliege.be,"Cote, Julien/B-7809-2011","Cote, Julien/0000-0002-4453-5969",Laboratoire d'Excellence TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41]; Fyssen Foundation; CLE project entitled TRAM-MIDPYR [14051117]; 'Investissements d'avenir' programme from the Agence Nationale de la rechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-INBS-0001AnaEE-Services]; Laboratoire d'Excellence CEBA [ANR-10-LABX-25-01];  [ANR-12-JSV7-0004-01],"This work was carried out at the Station d'Ecologie Theorique et Experimentale (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR 5321) and the Laboratoire Evolution et Diversite Biologique (CNRS, Universite Paul Sabatier, IRD, UMR 5174), which are supported by the Laboratoires d'Excellence TULIP (ANR-10-LABX-41) and CEBA (ANR-10-LABX-25-01).

Within such shared landscapes, co-occurrence of humans and predators often leads to human-carnivore conflicts and pose a substantial challenge for biodiversity conservation. To better elucidate large carnivore space use within a hotspot of human-wildlife conflicts, we used GPS data for leopards (N=6) to identify behavioral states and document spatial patterns of resource selection in response to season and human activity periods within a fragmented landscape of North Bengal, eastern India. We identified two major behavioral states (i.e. resting and travelling). From the resource selection models, we found leopards selected habitats with dense to moderate vegetation cover and proximity to water while resting and travelling within the landscape. During the dry season, when risk of human-leopard conflicts is highest, leopards selected tea plantations, forest patches but avoided protected areas. These results suggest a potential for increase in human-carnivore conflicts and a strategy to conserve large predators within multiple-use landscapes of South Asia.","[Naha, Dipanjan; Dash, Suraj Kumar; Sathyakumar, Sambandam] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Endangered Species Management, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Kupferman, Caitlin; Beasley, James C.] Univ Georgia, Savannah Res Ecol Lab, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,"Sathyakumar, S (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Dept Endangered Species Management, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",ssk@wii.gov.in,,,"Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India under the National Mission for Himalayan Studies (NMHS) [NMHS/LG/2016/009]","This study was funded by was funded by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India under the National Mission for Himalayan Studies (NMHS).

We examined the effect of recreational trails on the risk of nest predation and nest predator activity at four lowland riparian sites along the Front Range of Colorado. At one site on each of two streams, we placed a transect of artificial nests near a recreational trail and another transect on the opposite side of the stream, We also placed another transect of nests at a second site on each stream that was not associated with a recreational trail. In 1995, nests were baited with quail eggs; in 1996 a clay egg was also added to nests to aid us in nest predator identification. Artificial nests are not perfect surrogates for natural nests, but are useful in generating hypotheses about causes of nest failure and for detecting changes in predator assemblages. Overall, predation rates were high (93%). There were significant differences in vulnerability to predation on the different transect types, with a tendency for predation rates to increase with distance from trails. There was a significant effect of time with a greater risk of predation in 1996. In 1996, 83% of the clay eggs that were recovered showed signs of predation. House Wrens destroyed 11% of the clay eggs; impressions from Black-billed Magpies, Blue Jays, and Common Grackles were found on 69%; mice preyed on 25%; and squirrels on 12% of the eggs. Birds attacked more nests near trails than away from trails, whereas mammals appeared to avoid nests near trails to some extent. These results support the contention that recreational trails and human activity may affect nesting success for some species, and suggest that patterns of nest predation reflect the unique, and sometimes, counter-intuitive responses of individual predator species. Rather than relying on simplistic assumptions about the compatibility of recreation and wildlife, it is important to consider how individual species respond to the habitat alteration and human activity associated with trails when deciding where trails should be located and in developing overall conservation strategies in human-dominated areas.

An important question for conserving large carnivores outside of protected areas is the role of human activity in influencing the behavior of these predators. We used high-resolution animal location tracking and statistical modeling to examine the behavior of seven leopards (Panthera pardus) occupying an area that includes a research center and livestock ranch in central Kenya. Our analyses reveal changes in habitat selection around the times of sunrise and sunset, corresponding with changes in human activity at our site. Activity patterns were also variable within and among the leopards in our sample. To explore sources of this variability, we used regression modeling to estimate the relative influence of changing spatial and environmental conditions for leopard ranging behavior. Despite the tendency to be active during the day, we found that leopards strongly avoided areas where they were likely to encounter people during the daytime and showed variable selection for these same areas at night. The use of anthropogenic habitats was also associated with periods of greater ranging activity. We discuss the implications of these results for conservation efforts that attempt to balance the demands of livestock ranching alongside carnivore conservation.","[Van Cleave, Eric K.; Caillaud, Damien; Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bidner, Laura R.; Caillaud, Damien; Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bidner, Laura R.; Ford, Adam T.; Isbell, Lynne A.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki 10400, Kenya; [Ford, Adam T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, 1177 Res Rd, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Wilmers, Chris C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Van Cleave, EK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",evancleave@ucdavis.edu,"Caillaud, Damien/AAH-5850-2019","Caillaud, Damien/0000-0002-8347-6869; Bidner, Laura/0000-0002-4198-6609","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1255913, BCS 99-03949, BCS 1266389]; L.S.B.

Recent studies demonstrate the surprising plasticity of oligodendrocytes and myelin with stress and experience, providing a potential mechanism by which trauma induces aberrant structural and functional changes in the adult brain. In this study, we utilized a translational approach to test the hypothesis that gray matter oligodendrocytes contribute to traumatic-stress-induced behavioral variation in both rats and humans. We exposed adult, male rats to a single, severe stressor and used a multimodal approach to characterize avoidance, startle, and fear-learning behavior, as well as oligodendrocyte and myelin basic protein (MBP) content in multiple brain areas. We found that oligodendrocyte cell density and MBP were correlated with behavioral outcomes in a region-specific manner. Specifically, stress-induced avoidance positively correlated with hippocampal dentate gyrus oligodendrocytes and MBP. Viral overexpression of the oligodendrogenic factor Olig1 in the dentate gyrus was sufficient to induce an anxiety-like behavioral phenotype. In contrast, contextual fear learning positively correlated with MBP in the amygdala and spatial-processing regions of the hippocampus. In a group of trauma-exposed US veterans, T1-/T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging estimates of hippocampal and amygdala myelin associated with symptom profiles in a region-specific manner that mirrored the findings in rats. These results demonstrate a species-independent relationship between region-specific, gray matter oligodendrocytes and differential behavioral phenotypes following traumatic stress exposure. This study suggests a novel mechanism for brain plasticity that underlies individual variance in sensitivity to traumatic stress.","[Long, Kimberly L.

Rats foraging for food in a large arena encountered either a 2D or 3D looming stimulus, to which they instinctively fled back to a safe nest. When facing a direct aerial threat, female rats exhibited a greater fear response than males and this divergence maintained when exposed to the environment on subsequent days with no predator interaction, suggesting stronger contextual fear in female rats.

Recordings at the vervets' sleeping site revealed that they gave 'leopard' alarm calls most frequently near dusk and dawn, whereas photographs showed that leopards approached vervets more closely at night, when the monkeys alarm-called less often. GPS data showed that after vervets alarm-called, leopards within 200 m quickly moved away, changing direction, but when vervets did not alarm-call, leopards continued moving forward. These results reveal that vervets' leopard alarm calls function as a predator deterrent in addition to a conspecific warning call.","[Isbell, Lynne A.; Bidner, Laura R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Isbell, Lynne A.; Bidner, Laura R.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya",,"Isbell, LA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Isbell, LA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Isbell, LA (corresponding author), Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya.",laisbell@ucdavis.edu,,,"Wenner-Gren Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 99-03949, BCS 1266389]; L.S.B.

However, few studies have examined behavioural responses by large carnivores to motorised and non-motorised recreational activity - a knowledge gap that has implications for the success of human access management aimed at improving habitat quality for wildlife. We used an integrated step selection analysis of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) radiotelemetry data and a spatio-temporal model of motorised and non-motorised human recreational activity to examine how human recreational activity on trails affects both habitat selection and movement behaviour of individual bears. Grizzly bears were captured and radiocollared in the west-central Alberta Rocky Mountains and Foothills, and trail cameras were deployed on trails to obtain data on human recreational activity. We found that models including data on recreational activity outperformed trail-proximity models when interactions with movement covariates were included. Responses were highly variable among individuals and across classes: males, females, and females with cubs. Male and solitary female grizzly bears increased avoidance of trails with a high probability of motorised activity as well as displaying increased movement rates in response to motorised recreation. Females with cubs did not increase avoidance, however they had the largest response in terms of higher movement rates. In contrast, for all classes, selection for proximity to trail increased when probability of non-motorised activity was high, and the effect on movement was dampened relative to the motorised response. Synthesis and applications. By combining selection and movement into a unified modelling framework, we show that bears alter selection and movement behaviour in response to trails and recreation, and that such responses are determined by the type of recreational activity. Reduced selection and increased movement in proximity to motorised trails could affect bears' ability to exploit foraging opportunities in these areas. Future access management actions for grizzly bear recovery should consider frequency and type of linear feature use by humans rather than solely relying on thresholds relating to feature densities.","[Ladle, Andrew; Avgar, Tal; Boyce, Mark S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Wheatley, Matthew; Nielsen, Scott E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Stenhouse, Gordon B.] fRI Res, Hinton, AB, Canada",,"Ladle, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",ladle@ualberta.ca,"Nielsen, Scott/O-7482-2019; Avgar, Tal/W-9520-2019; Boyce, Mark/A-2620-2014","Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Avgar, Tal/0000-0002-8764-6976; Boyce, Mark/0000-0001-5811-325X",International Bear Association; Parks Canada; Alberta Conservation Association; Mountain Equipment Co-op; Alberta Environment and Parks; TD: Friends of the Environment; Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute; Safari Club International: Northern Alberta Chapter,International Bear Association; Parks Canada; Alberta Conservation Association; Mountain Equipment Co-op; Alberta Environment and Parks; TD: Friends of the Environment; Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute; Safari Club International: Northern Alberta Chapter,,74,18,18,5,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The theory of migratory coupling postulates that aggregations of migrant prey can induce large-scale synchronized movements in predators, and this coupling is consequential for the dynamics of ecological communities. The degree to which humans influence these interactions remains largely unknown. We tested whether creation of large resource pulses by humans such as seasonal herding of reindeer Rangifer tarandus and hunting of moose, Alces alces, can induce migratory coupling with Golden Eagles, Aquila chrysaetos, and whether these lead to demographic consequences for the eagles. Location Fennoscandia. Methods We used movement data from 32 tracked Golden Eagles spanning 125 annual migratory cycles over 8 years. We obtained reindeer distribution data through collaboration with reindeer herders based on satellite tracking of reindeer, and moose harvest data from the national hunting statistics for Sweden. We assessed demographic consequences for eagles from ingesting lead from ammunition fragments in moose carcasses through survival estimates and their links with lead concentrations in eagles' blood. Results In spring, eagles migrated hundreds of kilometres to be spatially and temporally coupled with calving reindeer, whereas in autumn, eagles matched their distribution with the location and timing of moose hunt. Juveniles were more likely to couple with reindeer calving, whereas adults were particularly drawn to areas of higher moose harvest. Due to this coupling, eagles ingested lead from spent ammunition in moose offal and carcasses and the resulting lead toxicity increased the risk of mortality by 3.4 times. Main conclusions We show how migratory coupling connects landscape processes and that human actions can influence migratory coupling over large spatial scales and increase demographic risks for predators. We provide vital knowledge towards resolving human-wildlife conflicts and the conservation of protected species over a large spatial and temporal scale.","[Singh, Navinder J.; Ecke, Frauke; Hornfeldt, Birger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Katzner, Todd] U S Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosystem Sci Ctr, Boise, ID USA; [Bagchi, Sumanta] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Sandstrom, Per] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, Umea, Sweden",,"Singh, NJ (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",navinder.singh@slu.se,"Ecke, Frauke/AAW-6468-2021","Ecke, Frauke/0000-0003-4208-345X",Naturvardsverket; Energimyndigheten,"Naturvardsverket, Grant/Award Number: Vindval; Energimyndigheten, Grant/Award Number: Vindval",,62,0,0,5,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

This balance is particularly true for gallinaceous birds, such as the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), which are ground foragers and are often exposed to increased predation risk compared to arboreal foragers. We studied how bobwhites might mitigate the threat of human hunting pressure by altering their foraging strategy. We directly monitored hunting encounters with bobwhites, during October 2014-March 2015, and collected daily movement paths (n=514) using radio-telemetry. We performed first-passage time analysis to infer foraging behavior by calculating bout frequency, area, duration, and timing. We found bobwhites mitigated exposure to human hunters by increasing foraging frequency coupled with a decrease in duration (15.4%) and area (7.1%) in response to hunting pressure. We observed a temporal shift in foraging away from peak hunting hours by 30minutes when birds were recently exposed to a discharged firearm. Our results imply that hunting game species can disrupt timing of foraging and therefore influence allocation to competing activities such as anti-predator vigilance. We propose implementing a dynamic harvest management regime that distributes hunting activity temporally and spatially to mitigate high hunting pressure and reduce behavioral effects on bobwhites. Careful planning of hunting activity should reduce its additive effects on natural mortality while improving hunter satisfaction. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society. Northern bobwhites altered their foraging in response to increased levels of hunting pressure in an intensely managed landscape such that bobwhites increased the frequency of foraging but decreased the duration and area foraged. Our results imply that anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting pressure, can lead to disruption of time allocated to foraging; therefore, we suggest distributing the spatial and temporal concentration of hunting evenly throughout the hunting season.","[McGrath, Diana J.; Terhune, Theron M., II] Tall Timbers Res Stn & Land Conservancy, 13093 Henry Beadel Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32312 USA; [Martin, James A.] Univ Georgia, Savannah River Ecol Lab, DB Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,"McGrath, DJ (corresponding author), Tall Timbers Res Stn & Land Conservancy, 13093 Henry Beadel Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32312 USA.",dmcgrath@talltimbers.org,,,Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy,"We thank field technicians E.

Two different processes may modulate fish antipredator behavior in the waters off remote archipelagos. First, places with low human density may have reduced fishing pressure. Second, due to their remoteness and lack of other human impacts, these isolated places may have more intact fish assemblages. We investigated antipredator behavior off the smallest archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic not subjected to regular spearfishing by quantifying flight initiation distance (FID) ? the distance a diver can approach a fish before it flees. Our goal was to identify natural patterns of risk assessment in reef fish. We focused on five common species and investigated how body size, group size and depth influence on the FID. In contrast to previous studies, we found that Caranx lugubris had significantly negative relationships between body size and FID, whereas Kyphosus sectatrix showed an opposite relationship. Finally, only a single species (Melichthys niger) had a significant relationship between depth and FID. Given we found small FID for all species studied, we suggest that much of our understanding of fish antipredator behavior studied using FID may reflect the somewhat ubiquitous impact of humans on species' risk assessments and not reflect patterns seen in areas with very low human density/disturbance. Our results suggest that fish antipredator behavior may be a metric of human impacts.","[Nunes, Jose Anchieta C.

To compensate for the increased risk while sleeping, many bird species have evolved eye-blinking strategies called peeking, which allows vigilance to persist in a sleep-like state. However, the drivers of vigilance behaviour during sleep have rarely been explored. We investigated how social factors, anthropogenic disturbance and environmental conditions affected the sleep-vigilance trade-off in the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus). Data were collected on the frequency, total duration and average duration of peeking at two locations on the Menai Strait, North Wales. Our results reveal that exposure to anthropogenic disturbance, particularly the presence of people exercising dogs, led to an increase in vigilance duration and reduced time sleeping, while increasing boat traffic resulted in elevated levels of peek frequency, but the overall duration of vigilance was in fact reduced. Furthermore, oystercatchers adjust their vigilance behaviour according to social context, with reduced levels of individual vigilance when a greater number of animals were present. However, if surrounding neighbours were awake - then the observed animal was more likely to be alert, demonstrating the importance of monitoring the behaviour of conspecifics. Likewise, the temperature and wind speed influenced vigilance with elevated levels of peek frequency observed in warmer and windier conditions. Oystercatchers are able to make fine-scale adjustments to their vigilance behaviour while asleep, which reduces the risk of external threats such as predators. Nevertheless, they are making these decisions against the backdrop of a finely balanced energy budget, particularly during the winter months. Increased levels of human activity and disturbance may elevate the costs of vigilance and ultimately have fitness implications for this species.","[McBlain, M.; Jones, K.

However, recently the thrift family of hypotheses have attracted serious criticism necessitating alternative thinking Optimization of foraging behaviour is an important aspect of behavioural evolution. For a species evolved for optimizing nutritional benefits against predation or other foraging risks, reduction in foraging risk below a threshold dramatically increases the steady-state body weight. In modem life where feeding is detached from foraging, the behavioural regulation mechanisms are likely to fail resulting into escalation of adiposity. At a proximate level the signalling pathways for foraging optimization involve fear induced signal molecules in the brain including Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART) interacting with adiposity signals such as leptin. While leptin promotes the expression of the fear peptides, the fear peptides promote anorectic action of leptin. This interaction promotes foraging drive and risk tolerance when the stored energy is low and suppresses hunger and foraging drive when the perceived risk is high. The ecological model of foraging optimization and the molecular model of interaction of these peptides converge in the outcome that the steady state adiposity is an inverse square root function of foraging risk. The foraging optimization model is independent of thrift or insurance hypotheses, but not mutually exclusive. We review existing evidence and suggest testable predictions of the model. Understanding obesity simultaneously at proximate and ultimate levels is likely to suggest effective means to curb the obesity epidemic.","[Baig, Ulfat; Lokhande, Lavanya; Lalwani, Poortata; Chawla, Suraj] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Dr Home Bhabha Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Watve, Milind] Deenanath Mangeshkar Hosp & Res Ctr, Pune, Maharashtra, India",,"Watve, M (corresponding author), Deenanath Mangeshkar Hosp & Res Ctr, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",ulfat@iiserpune.ac.in; lavanya.lokhande5@gmail.com; poortata.l@gmail.com; suraj.chawla591@gmail.com; milind.watve@gmail.com,,"Lalwani, Poortata/0000-0003-3022-3152",Rajeev Gandhi Science and Technology Commission,UB and PL were supported by Maharashtra Gene Bank Programme funded by Rajeev Gandhi Science and Technology Commission during the work.

Three hypotheses have traditionally been used to explain sexual segregation: (1) the predation risk hypothesis, (2) the forage selection hypothesis, (3) the activity budget hypothesis. The first of these seems to be a valid explanation of large-scale segregation in fallow deer at San Rossore, where the use by the two sexes of areas characterized by intense anthropic disturbance, during the day, was compared with other areas not affected by human pressure. Males showed a high use of disturbed areas, both during the day and the night, with the exception of the rutting period, when they reached more remote areas to mate. Females frequented disturbed areas only during the night, with the exception of the birth period, when sexual segregation peaked because females never used these areas, not even during the night. The forage selection hypothesis was invalid on a large scale, considering that no differences between the degree of day and night sexual segregation were to be expected. However, the predation risk hypothesis seems not to be a valid explanation of small-scale sexual segregation, when further subdivisions of disturbed areas are considered, because sexes proved to be segregated also during the night in the area they both used. This emphasizes both the importance of scale in understanding ecological processes, since a combination of many different factors may be responsible for the evolution of sexual segregation in ungulates, and the importance of human pressure in influencing deer behaviour.","Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Zool & Antropol Biol, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",,"Apollonio, M (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Zool & Antropol Biol, Via Muroni 25, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",marcoapo@uniss.it,"Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013","Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509",,,,59,39,41,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Methods: Based on longitudinal self-report data from 4327 California and Oregon students, we used logistic regression to develop weighted estimates of the prevalence of academic difficulties, substance use, and delinquent behavior within the three smoking status groups at grades 7 and 12. Huber variance estimates, which adjust for weighting and clustering of observations, were used to assess the statistical significance of differences across groups. Results: Compared with nonsmokers, early smokers were at least 3 times more likely by grade 12 to regularly use tobacco and marijuana, use hard drugs, sell drugs, have multiple drug problems, drop out of school, and experience early pregnancy and parenthood. These adolescents were also at higher risk for low;academic achievement and behavioral problems at school, stealing and other delinquent behaviors, and use of predatory and relational violence. Early experimenters were;at significantly greater risk for these problems as well, although to a lesser extent than smokers. Importantly, the higher risk among experimenters and smokers of experiencing many of these problems was evident as early as grade 7. Conclusions: Early experimenters and smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to experience various problem behaviors by grade 12, with many of these problems evident as early as grade 7. Results suggest that substance use programs that target multiple problems in addition to smoking may be most effective for these high-risk adolescents.

Low probability-high consequence events such as shark bites on humans attract substantial media attention for short time periods, but how the media react when several of these rare but fatal events occur in quick succession has seldom been subject to quantitative analysis. Understanding media portrayal of such encounters is important because it both reflects and influences public perceptions of risks, mitigation measures, and conservation policies. This study examined media portrayals of sharks between 2011 and 2013 in the state of Western Australia during which six shark bites resulting in fatalities occurred. We analysed 361 shark-related articles published in major Western Australian newspapers over 26 months to trace changes in media reporting about sharks prior to, during, and after the six fatalities. The findings indicate that when rare, but fatal human-wildlife events occur in quick succession, negative framing by media of wildlife behaviour and threats can exaggerate public anxiety about the pervasive presence of wildlife predators and high risk of human fatalities. The study highlights the need for government agencies and conservation scientists to better engage with media to provide accurate and effective information and advice to swimmers and surfers about shark ecology and behaviour.","[Sabatier, Etienne] Inst Univ Europeen Mer, Brest, France; [Sabatier, Etienne; Huveneers, Charlie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia",,"Huveneers, C (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",charlie.huveneers@flinders.edu.au,,"Huveneers, Charlie/0000-0001-8937-1358",,,,85,34,34,8,29,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0972-4923,0975-3133,,CONSERV SOC,Conserv.

More specifically, we test whether gibbons respond to the presence of humans in a manner consistent with predator-avoidance and predicted that the gibbon study subjects would avoid areas visited by humans (Risk-Disturbance Hypothesis). Data were collected August 2010-June 2011. We collected GPS locations and behavioral data on both the humans (6,652 hours) and the gibbons (1,253 hours) in the forest using 10 minute instantaneous sampling. Results indicate that humans preferentially assemble at the most sacred spot in the forest (Cikajayaan waterfall). Two gibbon groups' home ranges encompassed most of the sacred areas. Group B avoided areas of high human use, as high human use areas and high gibbon use areas did not overlap. Group C, though, continued to use areas that were heavily visited by humans. We thus found partial support for the Risk-Disturbance Hypothesis, although the variation in gibbon response to human disturbance indicates behavioral flexibility. We suggest that understanding the effects of shared space on wildlife is necessary for informing conservation policy in human-visited forests.","[Reisland, Melissa Ann] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anthropol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Reisland, Melissa Ann; Lambert, Joanna E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Reisland, MA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anthropol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Reisland, MA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",melissa.reisland@colorado.edu,,,"Fulbright Institute of International Education; Primate Conservation, Inc.

However, these deficiencies may result from other factors, e.g., comorbid psychopathology. The current study investigated the neuropsychological functioning of young adult males at high risk for alcohol abuse due to a family history of alcoholism (FH) and/or a personal history of antisocial personality disorder (ASP). A family history of alcoholism (FH+) alone was not associated with neuropsychological impairment. Subjects with ASP, however, exhibited some difficulty with higher level motor control and with verbal concept formation compared with nonASP subjects. No clear pattern of FH x ASP interaction was evident in the measures examined. These findings suggest that previous findings suggesting cognitive deficiencies in FH+ individuals may have been related to a failure to consider co-morbid ASP. The deficits exhibited by the ASP subjects may reflect both reduced inhibitory control and a deficiency in higher level verbal skills. These deficiencies may leave ASP individuals less capable of utilizing higher level language skills to regulate behavior.","UNIV CONNECTICUT,SCH MED,DEPT PSYCHIATRY,FARMINGTON,CT 06030",,,,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [P50AA003510] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [2P50 AA3510] Funding Source: Medline,,,62,61,62,0,1,WILLIAMS & WILKINS,BALTIMORE,"351 WEST CAMDEN ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21201-2436",0145-6008,,,ALCOHOL CLIN EXP RES,Alcoholism (NY),APR,1992,16,2,,,,,206,214,,10.1111/j.1530-0277.1992.tb01365.x,,,9,Substance Abuse,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Substance Abuse,HP802,WOS:A1992HP80200010,1590541,,,,2022-04-19,

Since trees and cliff faces provide safety from these predators, baboons might use such refuges in order to reduce predation risk. This hypothesis was explored in a study of four groups of chacma baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, in a desert population in Namibia (groups ranged between 22 and 55 individuals with one to six adult males). All baboons spent most of their time close by refuges and little time distant from them. This pattern was most accentuated among females in smaller groups. These females spent more time on refuges primarily as a result of greater refuge use during resting and grooming. This pattern was less clear during feeding and travelling, apparently owing to the constraints on refuge use imposed by the nature of these activities. A comparison of refuge use in high-risk and low-risk habitats (after the confounding effects of habitat-specific refuge availability had been removed) suggests that baboons might adopt one of two strategies in high-risk areas; if refuges are widespread they will use refuges more intensively, but if refuges are scarce they will adopt a time-minimizing strategy to leave the area as rapidly as possible. The baboons also increased their vigilance when refuges were distant. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that baboons use refuges to reduce predation risk.

Our global study revealed a strong effect of humans on daily patterns of wildlife activity. Animals increased their nocturnality by an average factor of 1.36 in response to human disturbance. This finding was consistent across continents, habitats, taxa, and human activities. As the global human footprint expands, temporal avoidance of humans may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence. However, such responses can result in marked shifts away from natural patterns of activity, with consequences for fitness, population persistence, community interactions, and evolution.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Hojnowski, Cheryl E.; Brashares, Justin S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Carter, Neil H.] Boise State Univ, Human Environm Syst Res Ctr, Boise, ID 83725 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kgaynor@berkeley.edu,,"Carter, Neil/0000-0002-4399-6384; Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",NSF-GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program [IIA-1301792]; NSF-CNH [115057],K.M.G. and C.E.H. were funded by the NSF-GRFP; N.H.C. was supported by IIA-1301792 from the NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program; and J.S.B. was funded in part by NSF-CNH 115057.,,55,329,350,25,196,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,JUN 15,2018,360,6394,,,,,1232,+,,10.1126/science.aar7121,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,GJ4OM,WOS:000435360400053,29903973,Green Submitted,,,2022-04-19,

This transition occurs in most altricial animals, but our understanding of the behavioral neurobiology has mostly relied on the infant rat. The transformation from dependence to independence occurs over three weeks in pups and is accompanied by complex changes in responses to both natural and learned threats and the supporting neural circuitry. Overall, in early life, the threat system is quiescent and learning is biased towards acquiring attachment related behaviors to support attachment to the caregiver and proximity seeking. Caregiver-associated cues learned in infancy have the ability to provide a sense of safety throughout lifetime. This attachment/safety system is activated by learning involving presumably pleasurable stimuli (food, warmth) but also painful stimuli (tailpinch, moderate shock). At about the midway point to independence, pups begin to have access to the adult-like amygdala-dependent threat system and amygdala-dependent responses to natural dangers such as predator odors. However, pups have the ability to switch between the infant and adult-like system, which is controlled by maternal presence and modification of stress hormones. Specifically, if the pup is alone, it will learn fear but if with the mother it will learn attachment (10-15 days of age). As pups begin to approach weaning, pups lose access to the attachment system and rely only on the amygdala-dependent threat system. However, pups learning system is complex and exhibits flexibility that enables the mother to override the control of the attachment circuit, since newborn pups may acquire threat responses from the mother expressing fear in their presence. Together, these data suggest that the development of pups' threat learning system is not only dependent upon maturation of the amygdala, but it is also exquisitely controlled by the environment. Most notably the mother can switch pup learning between attachment to threat learning in a moment's notice. This enables the mother to navigate pup's learning about the world and what is threatening and what is safe. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is the situation for an increasing number of mammalian prey species, as large carnivores recover or are reintroduced in ecosystems on several continents. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus in southern Norway illustrate a case in which prey face two predators with contrasting patterns of predation risk. They face a catch-22 situation: spatially avoiding the risk from one predator (lynx Lynx lynx in dense habitat) implies exposure to the other (hunters in open habitat). Using GPS-data from 29 roe deer, we tested for daily and seasonal variation in roe deer selection for habitat with respect to the habitats' year-round average risk level. Generally, roe deer altered their habitat selection between night and day in a pattern consistent with being able to avoid predicted risk from the nocturnal lynx during night and predicted risk from human hunters during day. However, seasonal variation in habitat selection only partially corresponded with the predicted seasonal variation in risk. Whereas roe deer avoided areas with high risk from hunters more strongly during the hunting season than in other seasons, there was a lack of selection towards areas and time periods lowering the risk of lynx predation during winter. It seems likely that the risk of starvation and thermal stress constrain roe deer habitat selection during this energetically challenging season with cold temperatures, snow cover and limited natural forage. The habitat selection pattern of roe deer fits thus only partly with the two contrasting risk gradients they face. Adjusting risk-avoidance behavior temporally can be an adaptive response in the case of several predators whose predation patterns differ in space and time.","[Lone, Karen; Gobakken, Terje; Loe, Leif Egil] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Lone, Karen] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, Tromso, Norway; [Mysterud, Atle] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, Oslo, Norway; [Odden, John; Linnell, John] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway",,"Loe, LE (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway.",leif.egil.loe@nmbu.no,"Odden, John/F-6088-2019; Linnell, John/V-4177-2019; Mysterud, Atle/AAQ-2864-2020","Odden, John/0000-0002-6275-8648; Linnell, John/0000-0002-8370-5633; Mysterud, Atle/0000-0001-8993-7382; Lone, Karen/0000-0003-1016-4351",Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Norwegian Environment Agency; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA); Nature Protection Division of the County Governor's Office for Buskerud county; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"This study was supported by the Research Council of Norway, the Norwegian Environment Agency, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), the Nature Protection Division of the County Governor's Office for Buskerud county, and the municipalities of Fla, Gol, Nes, and Al as well as by the large carnivore management board for region 2.

When a predation risk arises, gregarious, open-habitat-dwelling ungulates usually increase their vigilance rate and enlarge their herd sizes, which are the two antipredator responses that are most often investigated. However, other reactive responses, as well as prey risk assessments and escape strategies depending on a predator's approach behavior, are less explored. In this paper I want to discuss the responses of goitered gazelles and their escape strategies when they encountered humans or vehicles in their natural habitat in Kazakhstan. I found that in most cases adult goitered gazelles, being more experienced and habituated to dangerous situations, usually made a preflight risk assessment and stopped in mid escape for an additional scan of their surroundings. The younger, more reactive individuals behaved this way less often and instead ran immediately instead regardless of threat level. In cases with a more obvious, direct danger, all goitered gazelles, irrespective of age, galloped immediately without stopping, and ran mainly in a sideways direction almost perpendicular to or even across the path of the approaching predator. Goitered gazelles also preferred to run upward to elevated points or toward mountain foothills, where they could get higher than the perceived threat. Furthermore, this study has shown that the goitered gazelles, preferring rough open terrain of lowlands and foothills, combined escape features found in typical antipredator strategies of both open-habitat antelopes (first assessment of danger mainly through sight, then galloping to outrun the predator) and mountain-dwelling ungulates (use of rough terrain as refuge, running to the highest elevation for a better view, and attempting to get higher on the slope than their pursuer). The goitered gazelles, however, did not demonstrate any freezing pattern for concealment, typical for forest-dwelling ungulates.","[Blank, D.

We collected data on natural human vigilance behaviour in two different contemporary environments (a large refectory-style cafeteria and open parks) to test between four alternative hypotheses for this relationship: predation risk, searching for friends, mate searching and mate guarding. The results demonstrate that, at least in contemporary city environments, humans monitor their surroundings largely for reasons motivated by mate searching. Data on whom subjects look at in a busy environment indicate that males are significantly more likely to attend differentially to female passers-by, but that females show a less clear-cut discrimination. We conclude that vigilance patterns are determined by locally salient functions.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, ESRC Res Ctr Econ Learning & Social Evolut, Liverpool L69 3GS, Merseyside, England",,"Dunbar, RIM (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, ESRC Res Ctr Econ Learning & Social Evolut, Nicholson Bldg, Liverpool L69 3GS, Merseyside, England.",,"Daly, Frank/AAR-5807-2021",,,,,30,14,14,1,28,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,MAY,2002,139,,5,,,,695,711,,10.1163/15685390260136771,,,17,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,576AL,WOS:000176980600008,,,,,2022-04-19,

Although many nonlethal mitigation solutions are available, they rarely use the behavioral ecology of the conflict species to derive effective and longlasting solutions. Here, we use a long-term study with 106 GPS-collared free-ranging cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) to demonstrate how new insights into the socio-spatial organization of this species provide the key for such a solution. GPS-collared territory holders marked and defended communication hubs (CHs) in the core area of their territories. The CHs/territories were distributed in a regular pattern across the landscape such that they were not contiguous with each other but separated by a surrounding matrix. They were kept in this way by successive territory holders, thus maintaining this overdispersed distribution. The CHs were also visited by nonterritorial cheetah males and females for information exchange, thus forming hotspots of cheetah activity and presence. We hypothesized that the CHs pose an increased predation risk to young calves for cattle farmers in Namibia. In an experimental approach, farmers shifted cattle herds away from the CHs during the calving season. This drastically reduced their calf losses by cheetahs because cheetahs did not follow the herds but instead preyed on naturally occurring local wildlife prey in the CHs. This implies that in the cheetah system, there are problem areas, the CHs, rather than problem individuals. The incorporation of the behavioral ecology of conflict species opens promising areas to search for solutions in other conflict species with nonhomogenous space use.","[Melzheimer, Joerg; Heinrich, Sonja K.; Wasiolka, Bernd; Mueller, Rebekka; Palmegiani, Ivan; Portas, Ruben; Roeder, Ralf; Hofer, Heribert; Wachter, Bettina] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, D-10315 Berlin, Germany; [Thalwitzer, Susanne] Vet Off Ravensburg, D-88212 Ravensburg, Germany; [Weigold, Annika] Zool Garden Wilhelma, D-70376 Stuttgart, Germany; [Krofel, Miha] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Hofer, Heribert] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Vet Med, D-14163 Berlin, Germany; [Hofer, Heribert] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Biol Chem & Pharm, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",,"Melzheimer, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.",melzheimer@izw-berlin.de,"Hofer, Heribert/AAF-7854-2021","Hofer, Heribert/0000-0002-2813-7442; Portas, Ruben/0000-0002-0686-0701; Heinrich, Sonja/0000-0002-8934-009X; Krofel, Miha/0000-0002-2010-5219; Palmegiani, Ivan/0000-0001-8855-227X; Melzheimer, Joerg/0000-0002-3490-1515; Muller, Rebekka/0000-0003-3791-3308",WWF-Germany; German Academic Exchange ServiceDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We thank the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism for permission to conduct the study; the farmers of the Seeis, Hochfeld, and Auas Oanob Conservancies for cooperation; B.

However, few studies have examined the ecological impacts of human-induced trait changes across large spatial and temporal scales and species assemblages. We compared behavioural traits and predation rates by predatory fishes on standard squid prey in protected areas of different protection levels and ages, and found that predation rates were 6.5 times greater at old, no-take (greater than 40 years) relative to new, predominantly partial-take areas (approx. 8 years), even accounting for differences in predatory fish abundance, body size and composition across sites. Individual fishes in old protected areas consumed prey at nearly twice the rate of fishes of the same species and size at new protected areas. Predatory fish exhibited on average 50% longer flight initiation distance and lower willingness to forage at new protected areas, which partially explains lower foraging rates at new relative to old protected areas. Our experiments demonstrate that humans can effect changes in functionally important behavioural traits of predator guilds at large (30 km) spatial scales within managed areas, which require protection for multiple generations of predators to recover bold phenotypes and predation rates, even as abundance rebounds.","[Rhoades, O.

The extent and consequences of human disturbance on populations of vertebrates are contentious issues in conservation. As recreational and industrial uses of the countryside continue to expand, it is becoming increasingly important that the effects of such disturbance on wildlife are quantified. 2. This study describes a method of quantifying the effect of disturbance, based on measuring the trade-off between resource use and risk of disturbance. This approach is based on one used by ethologists to study the effects of predation risk on patch use. 3. Pink-footed geese, Anser brachyrhynchus, feeding on arable fields, are highly responsive to disturbance from surrounding roads. The extent to which these fields are exploited declines linearly with increasing risk of disturbance. The reduction in use of these feeding grounds caused by disturbance can be quantified by translating the biomass of food not exploited into the number of birds that this food could have supported. 4. This approach allows both quantification of the impact of disturbance on a population, and exploration of the potential consequences of changes in disturbance on the size of populations.",,,"Gill, JA (corresponding author), UNIV E ANGLIA,SCH BIOL SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND.",,"Gill, Jennifer A/A-7759-2008; Sutherland, William/B-1291-2013; Watkinson, Andrew R/N-1649-2013","Sutherland, William/0000-0002-6498-0437",,,,25,215,236,3,120,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Ecological uncertainty shapes neophobic predator avoidance in Trinidadian guppies,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Antipredator defence; Neophobia; Phenotypic plasticity; Behavioural trade-offs; Trinidadian guppies,COGNITIVE ECOLOGY; RISK; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; RECOGNITION; RETENTION; DECISIONS; ANIMALS; STRESS; CUES,"Neophobic predator avoidance (NPA), the fear response exhibited by prey animals exposed to novel stimuli, is a plastic trait thought to be induced by exposure to elevated chronic risk of predation. Indeed, prey experiencing low levels of background risk fail to display NPA, while those experiencing high background risk do display NPA. Recent work has suggested that the trigger for inducing and maintaining NPA may not be background risk per se but rather uncertainty in the predation environment. Here, we designed two experiments on wild-caught neophobic Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to test the uncertainty hypothesis'. In the first experiment, we tested if the diversity of novel stimuli encountered by guppies would affect the maintenance of their NPA. We found that exposure to a single novel odour once per day for 3days was sufficient to extinguish the neophobic response to that odour (Experiment 1A) but not a new odour (Experiment 1B). However, when guppies were exposed to multiple novel odours so that each odour was encountered once a day for 3days, they retained their NPA to both a previously encountered novel odour (Experiment 1A) and a new odour (Experiment 1B). In our second experiment, we repeatedly exposed guppies to a novel cue in a spatially predictable vs. unpredictable location and found that spatial unpredictability interfered with the reduction of NPA to that cue. Combined, our results suggest that uncertainty of risk experienced by prey in time and space shapes the retention of NPA.Significance statementWhen prey face uncertainty, or lack of complete information, about risk in their environment, they engage in adaptive antipredator behaviours such as neophobic predator avoidance. Showing a fear response to a novel stimulus in a high-risk environment is likely adaptive if we assume that most species in that environment are threats. Here, we aim to show how uncertainty, as opposed to simply background levels of risk, may influence the maintenance of neophobic responses in prey. On the basis of two experiments, we showed that prey experiencing increased uncertainty, via increased diversity and spatial unpredictability of novel cues, maintain their neophobic responses more so than prey experiencing lower uncertainty. Understanding the effects of ecological uncertainty on prey behaviour, particularly neophobia, will shed light on how prey might respond as uncertainty increases with climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat modification.","[Feyten, Laurence E.

Within NAc shell, orexin/hypocretin also has been reported to stimulate food intake and is implicated in reward, whereas blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by scopolamine suppresses intake and may have anti-reward effects. Here, we show that NAc microinjection of orexin-A in medial shell amplifies the hedonic impact of sucrose taste, but only within the same anatomically rostral site, identical to the opioid hotspot. By comparison, at all sites throughout medial shell, orexin microinjections stimulated 'wanting' to eat, as reflected by increases in intake of palatable sweet chocolates. At NAc shell sites outside the hotspot, orexin selectively enhanced 'wanting' to eat without enhancing sweetness 'liking' reactions. In contrast, microinjections of the antagonist scopolamine at all sites in NAc shell suppressed sucrose 'liking' reactions as well as suppressing intake of palatable food. Conversely, scopolamine increased aversive 'disgust' reactions elicited by bitter quinine at all NAc shell sites. Finally, scopolamine microinjections localized to the caudal half of medial shell additionally generated a fear related anti-predator reaction of defensive treading and burying directed toward the corners of the transparent chamber. Together, these results confirm a rostra' hotspot in NAc medial shell as a unique site for orexin induction of hedonic 'liking' enhancement, similar to opioid enhancement They also reveal distinct roles for orexin and acetylcholine signals in NAc shell for hedonic reactions and motivated behaviors.","[Castro, Daniel C.; Terry, Rachel A.; Berridge, Kent C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Castro, DC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",castrod@umich.edu,"Berridge, Kent C/C-1525-2009; Castro, Daniel/AAT-3097-2020","Berridge, Kent C/0000-0002-6031-2626; Castro, Daniel/0000-0001-8036-1313","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH63649, DA015188, DC00011]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH063649] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [T32DC000011] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA015188] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The enclosed manuscript contains original research that has not been published.

In animals, inducible defenses may manifest as changes in behavior, morphology, physiology, or life history, and prey species can adjust their defensive responses based on the dangerousness of predators. Analogously, prey may also change the composition and quantity of defensive chemicals when they coexist with different predators, but such predator-induced plasticity in chemical defenses remains elusive in vertebrates. In this study, we investigated whether tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) adjust their chemical defenses to predation risk in general and specifically to the presence of different predator species; furthermore, we assessed the adaptive value of the induced defense. We reared tadpoles in the presence or absence of one of four caged predator species in a mesocosm experiment, analyzed the composition and quantity of their bufadienolide toxins, and exposed them to free-ranging predators. We found that toad tadpoles did not respond to predation risk by upregulating their bufadienolide synthesis. Fishes and newts consumed only a small percentage of toad tadpoles, suggesting that bufadienolides provided protection against vertebrate predators, irrespective of the rearing environment. Backswimmers consumed toad tadpoles regardless of treatment. Dragonfly larvae were the most voracious predators and consumed more predator-naive toad tadpoles than tadpoles raised in the presence of dragonfly cues. These results suggest that tadpoles in our experiment had high enough toxin levels for an effective defense against vertebrate predators even in the absence of predator cues. The lack of predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in bufadienolide synthesis may be due to local adaptation for constantly high chemical defense against fishes in the study population and/or due to the high density of conspecifics.","[Ueveges, Balint; Szederkenyi, Mark; Bokony, Veronika; Hettyey, Attila] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Plant Protect Inst, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Otto Ut 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Ueveges, Balint; Szederkenyi, Mark; Mahr, Katharina; Hoi, Herbert] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Vienna, Austria; [Mahr, Katharina] Univ Debrecen, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, Debrecen, Hungary; [Moricz, Agnes M.; Kruzselyi, Daniel] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Plant Protect Inst, Dept Pathophysiol, Budapest, Hungary",,"Uveges, B (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Plant Protect Inst, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Otto Ut 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary.",uveges.balint@yahoo.de,"Bókony, Veronika/AAH-7679-2020; Móricz, Ágnes M/E-2416-2018; Krüzselyi, Dániel/AAZ-8401-2021","Bókony, Veronika/0000-0002-2136-5346; Móricz, Ágnes M/0000-0002-4330-9396; Krüzselyi, Dániel/0000-0003-4749-7010; Uveges, Balint/0000-0001-9234-9258","Sparkling Science Project of the Federal Ministry of Science and Research, Austria [SPA 04/171]; FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-631722]; Lendulet Programme [LP2012-24/2012]; Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA)Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Janos Bolyai Scholarship of MTA; Young Researcher Programme of MTA; National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) of Hungary [115402]","Sparkling Science Project of the Federal Ministry of Science and Research, Austria, Grant/Award Number: SPA 04/171; FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration Grant, Grant/Award Number: PCIG13-GA-2013-631722; Lendulet Programme, Grant/Award Number: LP2012-24/2012; Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA); Young Researcher Programme of MTA; Janos Bolyai Scholarship of MTA; National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) of Hungary, Grant/Award Number: 115402",,94,10,10,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Lizards that were approached rapidly fled while farther away from the predator than lizards that were approached more slowly. Skinks approached indirectly permitted closer approach than those approached directly. Approach distance increased more with directness of approach for individuals exposed on the ground than for those on trees. Eumeces laticeps responded to threat cues related to speed and directness of approach and distance from refuge. Males near females allowed closer approach than isolated males. Males with females have greater escape cost because they may lose fertilizations to other males and must search to relocate Females. Risk may be at least as great For males with females as for males alone, because two lizards are more likely than one to attract the attention of a predator, and females usually flee before males, leaving the males exposed alone.

The wild boar is one species known to change its activity pattern with the intensity of human disturbance. We conducted camera trap surveys in two study sites, Shingo and Himuro, in Tochigi, central Japan. We investigated effects of two types of human disturbance on the activity pattern of a wild boar population: 'direct' disturbance related to hunting activity and 'indirect' disturbance related to daily human activity. In the hunting season, relative abundance indices (RAI) of wild boars significantly decreased, and the proportion of activity at night increased compared with the nonhunting season. RAI of wild boars at night decreased with increasing distance from the settlement, while RAI of wild boars during the day did not. Relative proportion of activity at night was higher in cameras at 0-200 m from the settlements, while no significant pattern was found in cameras far from settlements. Both direct and indirect effects of human activity had a significant effect on the activity pattern of wild boars. A decrease in human activity may result in the rapid expansion of wild boar populations, and re-evaluation of the human factor is important for more intelligent management of wild boar populations and to solve the human-wildlife conflict.","[Ohashi, Haruka; Saito, Masae; Kuwabara, Takashi; Hiroshige, Yutaka] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Educ & Res Ctr Frontier Agr Sci, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; [Horie, Reiko] Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3218505, Japan; [Tsunoda, Hiroshi] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fac Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; [Noba, Hiromu; Ishii, Haruka] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Grad Sch Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; [Koike, Shinsuke; Hoshino, Yoshinobu; Toda, Hiroto; Kaji, Koichi] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Agr, Grad Sch Tokyo, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan",,"Ohashi, H (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Educ & Res Ctr Frontier Agr Sci, 3-5-8 Saiwai Cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.",oharu0429@gmail.com,"Koichi, Kaji/C-8355-2013; TODA, Hiroto/C-2889-2013; Hoshino, Yoshinobu/G-1159-2013; Koike, Shinsuke/C-4619-2013; Tsunoda, Hiroshi/L-2974-2019","Koichi, Kaji/0000-0001-6578-9995; TODA, Hiroto/0000-0003-1405-2381; Koike, Shinsuke/0000-0002-2926-8196; Tsunoda, Hiroshi/0000-0001-6214-5625","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","This study was supported by the Development of wildlife management system with DPSIR scheme project, the special budgets for research and education in the fiscal year of 2010 2011 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the risk assessment and defensive behavioral responses of captive white-lipped peccary (WLP; Tayassu pecari) and collared peccary (CP; Pecari tajacu), which retain different conservation status; WLP are considered vulnerable and CP of least concern. We used an adapted paradigm of the mouse defense test battery (MDTB) comprising four consecutive tests. Two of these tests simulated a novel environment, while the other two stimulated the expression of defensive behavioral patterns. Besides differences in risk assessment and defensive threat/attack behavioral patterns between species, we compared flight initiation distance, flight speed, and plasma glucocorticoid concentrations. When facing a novel environment and risk challenges from humans' predator-like cues, the white-lipped peccary showed more exploratory and defensive threat/attack behavioral patterns, shorter flight initiation distances, and lower flight speeds, whereas the collared peccaries showed more cautious and retreat patterns, longer flight initiation distances, and higher flight speeds. There were also correlations between physiological and behavioral parameters. We confirmed our hypothesis that the collared peccary's cautiousness may help to prevent a decrease in its population, while the white-lipped peccary's exploratory and confrontational behavioral patterns in overhunted areas, together with other simultaneous factors as forest fragmentation, might contribute to placing this species in the vulnerable category.","[Nogueira, Selene S.

This may be because Common Elders nest on offshore islands where terrestrial predators are limited and/or because this type of behaviour increases the risk of predation for the female. Elders at the East Bay colony, however, are subjected to Arctic Foxes (Alopex: lagopus) during egg-laying and early incubation and this may have influenced the frequency with which distraction display behaviors are expressed.","Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Yellowknife, NT X1A 1E2, Canada",,"Kay, MF (corresponding author), Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Suite 201,5204-50th Ave, Yellowknife, NT X1A 1E2, Canada.",,,,,,,26,1,1,1,7,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,OTTAWA,"PO BOX 35069, WESTGATE PO, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 1A2, CANADA",0008-3550,,,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

Aim: We explored the role of these interactions in the risk of disease transmission (foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]) between cattle and the African buffalo (the maintenance host) and how a top predator, the lion, may modulate these interactions. Location: The interface of Hwange National Park (HNP) and surrounding communal lands, Zimbabwe. Method: We combined a longitudinal serological cattle survey for FMD, GPS-collar data and cattle owners' interviews during four seasons in 2010-2011. Results: Overall FMD incidence in cattle was low, but showed a peak during the rainy season. The incidence dynamic was significantly explained by cattle incursion into the protected area (i.e., buffer zone of 3 km inside HNP) and not by contacts with buffalo or contacts among cattle. These results suggest that FMD virus either survives in the environment or is transmitted by other ungulate groups or species. The analysis of incursion frequency in the buffer suggests that (1) buffalo and cattle are avoiding each other up to 2 months after one species track and that (2) lions make frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it, whereas buffalo did not use areas occupied by lions. Lions could thus reduce the spatio-temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the interface, which could contribute to the low level of FMD incidence. Main conclusions: During the rainy season, traditional herding practices push cattle away from growing crops near villages into the HNP but not during the dry season, suggesting that cattle owners may decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land in the dry season to avoid the risks of infection and/or predation in the HNP. This study highlights the complex dynamics that operates at human/livestock/wildlife interfaces.","[Miguel, Eve; Grosbois, Vladimir; Caron, Alexandre; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel; Nicod, Florian] Cirad, AGIRs Anim & Integrated Management, UR22, Montpellier, France; [Miguel, Eve; Fritz, Herve; Caron, Alexandre; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel] Univ Zimbabwe, CNRS, Nust, UZ,Cirad,PCP,RP,UZ, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Fritz, Herve; Valeix, Marion] Univ Claude Bernard, CNRS, Lab Biomet & Biol Evolut, UMR 5558,Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France; [Caron, Alexandre] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Pretoria, South Africa; [Loveridge, Andrew J.; Stapelkamp, Brent; Macdonald, David W.; Valeix, Marion] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon, Oxon, England",,"Miguel, E (corresponding author), Cirad, AGIRs Anim & Integrated Management, UR22, Montpellier, France.",eve.miguel@ird.fr,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014; Caron, Alexandre/F-8969-2010; Valeix, Marion/A-5110-2010; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/AAI-1550-2019","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661; Caron, Alexandre/0000-0002-5213-3273; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/0000-0002-5438-1473","Cirad; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Harare, SCAC funds); EU (PARSEL project); Zimbabwean office of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO); FrenchANR (FEAR project)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-08-BLAN-0022]; Darwin Initiative for Biodiversity [162/09/015]; Eppley Foundation; Rufford Foundation; Regina B.

Importantly, prey vary considerably in their behavioral responses to exotic predators. Factors proposed to explain variation in prey response to exotic predators include the similarity of new predators to familiar, native predators, the prevalence and diversity of predators in a prey's past, and variation in a prey's innate ability to discriminate between predators and safety. While these factors have been put forth verbally in the literature, no theory exists that combines these hypotheses in a common conceptual framework using a unified behavioral model. Here, we formalize existing verbal arguments by modeling variation in prey responses to new predators in a state-dependent detection theory framework. We find that while some conventional wisdom is upheld, novel predictions emerge. As expected, prey respond poorly to exotic predators that do not closely resemble familiar predators. Furthermore, a history with more abundant or diverse native predators can lessen effects of some exotic predators on prey; however, under some conditions, the opposite prediction emerges. Also, prey that evolved in situations where they easily discriminate between safe and dangerous situations can be more susceptible to novel predators.","[Ehlman, Sean M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55114 USA; [Ehlman, Sean M.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ehlman, Sean M.; Trimmer, Pete C.; Sih, Andrew] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Trimmer, Pete C.] Univ Bielefeld, Evolut Biol, Konsequenz 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",,"Ehlman, SM (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55114 USA.; Ehlman, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Ehlman, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",sehlman@umn.edu,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",University of California Davis Dissertation Year Fellowship; National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSF Postdoctoral Research in Biology Fellowship; NSF Integrative Organismal Systems grantNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1456724]; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB TRR (Sonderforschungsbereich/Transregio) 212]; Sih lab group,"We thank the Sih lab group for support during the development of this project.

Thus, fleeing prey need flexible behaviors that increase fitness and chances of survival. This study Sought to understand how a small planktivore, Pseudorasbora parva, modifies its foraging behavior in a complex environment where multiple dangers exist. Fish were reared in a flume consisting of two types of rnicrohabitats; pools representing a profitable site with a higher predation risk, and riffles representing a safer but otherwise unfavorable site due to low foraging Success and flow velocity stress. The results showed that P. parva exhibited a high degree of flexibility in behavior reflecting the conflicting conditions of high velocity and predation risk. There was a trade-off between foraging rate and predation risk because prey escaped to the riffle when the pool which was the preferred habitat, was occupied by the predator. Microhabitat selection, feeding behavior, shoaling and swimming distance also reflected its adjustable responses with regard to variation of the risk of predation. The fish, under pressure of predation and high flow velocity, became more slender in body shape that might increase the swimming performance suited to avoidance behavior and minimize the swimming energy expenditure. This phenotypic modification may be a result of trade-off between morphological defense and swimming cost for fish inhabiting streams. These results suggest that small preys are able to demonstrate various compensatory behaviors in response to multiple conflicting conditions.","Saitama Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Human Engn, Sakura Ku, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan",,"Asaeda, T (corresponding author), Saitama Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Human Engn, Sakura Ku, 255,Shimookubo, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan.",asaeda@post.saitama-u.ac.jp,"Asaeda, Takashi/C-5278-2008","Sunardi, Sunardi/0000-0002-7972-3580",,,,52,18,18,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,OCT 15,2005,549,,,,,,155,166,,10.1007/s10750-005-5442-1,,,12,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,979CX,WOS:000232921100013,,,,,2022-04-19,

Studies of alarm vocalizations have revealed various levels of sophistication in classification [1-5]. In many taxa, reactions to danger are inflexible, but some species can learn the level of threat presented by the local population of a predator [6-8] or by specific, recognizable individuals [9, 10]. Some species distinguish several species of predator, giving differentiated warning calls and escape reactions; here, we explore an animal's classification of subgroups within a species. We show that elephants distinguish at least two Kenyan ethnic groups and can identify them by olfactory and color cues independently. In the Ambosell ecosystem, Kenya, young Maasai men demonstrate virility by spearing elephants (Loxodonta africana), but Kamba agriculturalists pose little threat. Elephants showed greater fear when they detected the scent of garments previously worn by Maasai than by Kamba men, and they reacted aggressively to the color associated with Maasai. Elephants are therefore able to classify members of a single species into subgroups that pose different degrees of danger.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY1 69JP, Fife, Scotland; Amboseli Trust Elephants, Nairobi 00509, Kenya",,"Bates, LA (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY1 69JP, Fife, Scotland.",,"Bates, Lucy A/N-6371-2017","Bates, Lucy A/0000-0003-4746-3312",,,,23,73,73,1,53,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0960-9822,1879-0445,,CURR BIOL,Curr.

However, in large parts of the world, particularly in Europe, large carnivores live in and are returning to strongly human-modified ecosystems. At present, we lack a coherent framework to predict the effects of large carnivores in these anthropogenic landscapes. We review how human actions influence the ecological roles of large carnivores by affecting their density or behaviour or those of mesopredators or prey species. We argue that the potential for density-mediated trophic cascades in anthropogenic landscapes is limited to unproductive areas where even low carnivore numbers may impact prey densities or to the limited parts of the landscape where carnivores are allowed to reach ecologically functional densities. The potential for behaviourally mediated trophic cascades may be larger and more widespread, because even low carnivore densities affect prey behaviour. We conclude that predator-prey interactions in anthropogenic landscapes will be highly context-dependent and human actions will often attenuate the ecological effects of large carnivores.

Thus, when disturbed, animal responses are likely to follow the same economic principles used by prey when encountering predators. We simulated predator attacks with different characteristics and in different situations to study the factors that determine the escape response of 1-year-old chinstrap penguins. The results indicate that 1-year-old penguins adjusted their escape behaviour according to the level of risk posed by the researcher acting as a potential predator. When 1-year-old penguins were close to a breeding subcolony, they started to escape later, and fled shorter distances, at lower speeds, and not fleeing directly into the subcolony. This contrasts with their fleeing behaviour far from subcolonies, when penguins fled sooner, for longer, and faster, and in a direction that maximized the distance between themselves and the experimenter, by fleeing directly away from the experimenter. This might suggest the existence of a trade-off between fleeing from the predator and avoiding entering the subcolony where 1-year-old penguins will receive aggressive responses from breeding adults. The type of approach was not important in deciding when to flee. However, penguins did escape for longer distances and faster when approached directly, showing that penguins were able to assess risk level based on predator behaviour. Our findings may have implications for management of penguin colonies visited by tourists. The delimitation of buffer areas and advice on how tourists should behave when approaching penguins might arise from studies of the factors that affect risk assessment of penguins.","CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,"Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Jose.Martin@mncn.csic.es,"Fargallo, Juan A/I-5585-2015; De Neve, Liesbeth/F-7896-2011; Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014","Fargallo, Juan A/0000-0003-4090-9000; De Neve, Liesbeth/0000-0003-0041-9824; Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Vicente, Polo/0000-0002-0994-5372",,,,45,24,26,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4060,,,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,NOV,2004,27,12,,,,,775,781,,10.1007/s00300-004-0653-x,,,7,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,870IH,WOS:000225050300006,,,,,2022-04-19,

Large carnivore conservation thus requires designing landscapes of coexistence, which should provide suitable habitats and dispersal opportunities in areas shared with humans. This study investigates the landscape of coexistence for the Iberian wolf, using movement data from 15 individuals to model how human-related risks constrain the spatial distribution of habitats and functional connectivity in highly modified landscapes. Wolves avoided potential sources of human disturbance, particularly settlements, roads, trails and windfarms. Avoidance was generally stronger for residents than dispersers, and in daytime than in twilight and night. There was strong elevational segregation, particularly at night, with higher and lower elevations selected by residents and dispersers, respectively. Conductance surfaces indicated that resident wolves were largely restricted to fragmented mountainous areas less used by people, while they faced strong resistance to movement in more densely populated lowlands. Higher tolerance to humans facilitated the movement of dispersers through the landscape, though they had the additional constraint of avoiding resident wolves. There were well-defined dispersal corridors potentially connecting most wolf packs. Our results reinforce the need to prevent new sources of human disturbance such roads and wind farms in remnant areas used by resident wolves, and to preserve continuous dispersal corridors through areas heavily used by humans. More generally, designing landscapes of coexistence should target at facilitating the spatial and temporal segregation of human structures and activities from large carnivore breeding and dispersal habitats.","[Rio-Maior, Helena; Nakamura, Monia; Alvares, Francisco; Beja, Pedro] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Rio-Maior, Helena] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal; [Beja, Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, CEABN InBio, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Prof Baeta Neves, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal",,"Rio-Maior, H (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio, Campus Agr Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",helenariomaior@gmail.com,"Nakamura, Mónia/M-9175-2013; Rio-Maior, Helena/M-8499-2013; Beja, Pedro/A-7851-2008; Alvares, Francisco/K-6353-2013","Nakamura, Mónia/0000-0003-2493-2489; Beja, Pedro/0000-0001-8164-0760; Alvares, Francisco/0000-0002-4033-6989; Rio-Maior, Helena/0000-0002-8210-0886",Empreendimentos Eolicos do Vale do Minho S.A.; Associacao para a Conservacao do Habitat do Lobo Iberico (ACHLI),"This study was funded by Empreendimentos Eolicos do Vale do Minho S.A. and Associacao para a Conservacao do Habitat do Lobo Iberico (ACHLI).

We determined the flight initiation distance (FID; i.e. human-animal distance when the animal begins to flee) of a common frugivorous bird of Southeast Asia, Sooty-headed Bulbul (Pycnonotus aurigaster) across a gradient of hunting pressures in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, SW China.

Here, we review recent studies in threespined sticklebacks (a species in which males are the sole providers of parental care) showing that when parents are exposed to an ecologically relevant stressor (predation risk), there are consequences for offspring. For example, female sticklebacks exposed to predation risk produce eggs with higher concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, and offspring with altered behavior and physiology. Male sticklebacks exposed to predation risk produce offspring that are less active, smaller, and in poorer condition. The precise mechanisms by which maternal and paternal experiences with predators affect offspring phenotypes are under investigation, and could include steroid hormones, olfactory cues and/or parental behavior. As in other species, some of the consequences of parental exposure to predation risk for offspring in sticklebacks might be adaptive, but depend on the stressor, the reliability of the parental and offspring environments and the evolutionary history of the population.","[Bell, Alison M.; McGhee, Katie E.; Stein, Laura] Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Sch Integrat Biol, 505 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [McGhee, Katie E.] Univ South, Dept Biol, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA; [Stein, Laura] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Bell, AM (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Sch Integrat Biol, 505 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",alisonmb@life.illinois.edu,,"McGhee, Katie/0000-0002-7965-5020","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 1121980, IOS 12-10696]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 GM082937]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM082937] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation IOS 1121980 to McGhee and Bell, IOS 12-10696 to Stein and Bell, and the National Institutes of Health R01 GM082937 to Bell and Mark Band.",,45,12,12,0,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-1546,2352-1554,,CURR OPIN BEHAV SCI,Curr.

The food-related factors influencing this movement have not been explored, but can be important for understanding the benefits and costs to black bear foraging behavior and the fundamental origins of bear conflicts. We tested whether the scarcity of wildland foods or the availability of urban foods can explain when black bears forage near houses, examined the extent to which male bears use urban areas in comparison to females, and identified the most important food items influencing bear movement into urban areas. We monitored 16 collared black bears in and around Missoula, Montana, during 2009 and 2010, while quantifying the rate of change in green vegetation and the availability of 5 native berry-producing species outside the urban area, the rate of change in green vegetation, and the availability of apples and garbage inside the urban area. We used parametric time-to-event models in which an event was a bear location collected within 100 m of a house. We also visited feeding sites located near houses and quantified food items bears had eaten. The probability of a bear being located near a house was 1.6 times higher for males, and increased during apple season and the urban green-up. Fruit trees accounted for most of the forage items at urban feeding sites (49%), whereas wildland foods composed <10%. Black bears foraged on human foods near houses even when wildland foods were available, suggesting that the absence of wildland foods may not influence the probability of bears foraging near houses. Additionally, other attractants, in this case fruit trees, appear to be more important than the availability of garbage in influencing when bears forage near houses.","[Merkle, Jerod A.; Krausman, Paul R.] Univ Montana, Boone & Crockett Program Wildlife Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Robinson, Hugh S.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Alaback, Paul] Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",,"Merkle, JA (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Boone & Crockett Program Wildlife Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",jerod.merkle.1@ulaval.ca,"Merkle, Jerod A/ABB-5431-2021","Merkle, Jerod A/0000-0003-0100-1833",Boone and Crockett Program in Wildlife Conservation; Harry Longwell Family Foundation,"We thank Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks for cooperation and logistical assistance, particularly M.

However, it is uncertain whether this dysfunction predates or is secondary to the onset of psychosis. Studying 21 unmedicated persons at risk for psychosis plus 24 healthy controls (HCs) we used a incentive delay paradigm with monetary rewards during functional magnetic resonance imaging. During processing of reward information, at-risk individuals performed similarly well to controls and recruited the same brain areas. However, while anticipating rewards, the high-risk sample exhibited additional activation in the posterior cingulate cortex, and the medio- and superior frontal gyrus, whereas no significant group differences were found after rewards were administered. Importantly, symptom dimensions were differentially associated with anticipation and outcome of the reward. Positive symptoms were correlated with the anticipation signal in the ventral striatum (VS) and the right anterior insula (rAI). Negative symptoms were inversely linked to outcome-related signal within the VS, and depressive symptoms to outcome related signal within the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Our findings provide evidence for a reward-associated dysregulation that can be compensated by recruitment of additional prefrontal areas. We propose that stronger activations within VS and rAl when anticipating a reward reflect abnormal processing of potential future rewards. Moreover, according to the aberrant salience theory of psychosis, this may predispose a person to positive symptoms. Additionally, we report evidence that negative and depressive symptoms are differentially associated with the receipt of a reward, which might demonstrate a broader vulnerability to motivational and affective symptoms in persons at-risk for psychosis.","[Wotruba, Diana; Heekeren, Karsten; Buechler, Roman; Theodoridou, Anastasia; Roessler, Wulf] Univ Hosp Psychiat Zurich, Zurich Program Sustainable Dev Mental Hlth Serv Z, CH-8021 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wotruba, Diana; Michels, Lars; Buechler, Roman; Kollias, Spyros] Univ Zurich Hosp, Dept Neuroradiol, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wotruba, Diana; Roessler, Wulf] Coll Helveticum, Zurich, Switzerland; [Heekeren, Karsten; Theodoridou, Anastasia; Kaiser, Stefan] Univ Hosp Psychiat, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Michels, Lars] Univ Childrens Hosp Zurich, Ctr MR Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Simon, Joe J.] Univ Heidelberg Hosp, Ctr Psychosocial Med, Dept Gen Internal Med & Psychosomat, Heidelberg, Germany; [Roessler, Wulf] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychiat, Lab Neurosci LIM 27, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Kaiser, Stefan] Univ Zurich, Ctr Integrat Human Physiol, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Wotruba, D (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Psychiat Zurich, Zurich Program Sustainable Dev Mental Hlth Serv Z, Mil Str 8,Postfach 1930, CH-8021 Zurich, Switzerland.",diana.wotruba@uzh.ch,"Simon, Joe/ABA-6896-2021; Michels, Lars/X-6939-2018","Simon, Joe/0000-0001-7407-1344; Rossler, Wulf/0000-0003-0049-4533; Kaiser, Stefan/0000-0002-3013-2034; Theodoridou, Anastasia/0000-0003-4792-385X; Heekeren, Karsten/0000-0001-5105-1922",Zurich Program for Sustainable Development of Mental Health Services (ZInEP),This work was supported by the Zurich Program for Sustainable Development of Mental Health Services (ZInEP).,,59,42,44,0,13,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

In contrast, other animals seemingly thrive in the presence of humans and benefit from human-derived resources. Flight initiation distance (FID: the distance between predator and prey when prey starts to flee) is a measure commonly used to assess animals' tolerance to humans. In this study, we tested how FID changes in relation to human presence in two hyrax species in Serengeti National Park. Hyraxes living on kopjes (rock outcrops) among human settlements showed a significantly shorter FID than hyraxes living on kopjes without human settlements. In addition, we found that hyraxes feeding before the experiment had shorter FID than hyraxes resting or being vigilant, and hyraxes disturbed during the early morning had shorter FID than hyraxes disturbed during late morning. We did not find any significant effects of group size or species composition on FID. Our results suggest that hyraxes living in the presence of humans are habituated and are not adversely affected by human settlements.","[Mbise, Franco P.] Univ Dodoma, Dept Conservat Biol, POB 338, Dodoma, Tanzania; [Mbise, Franco P.; Fredriksen, Kari-Elise; Ranke, Peter S.; Fossoy, Frode; Roskaft, Eivin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway; [Fyumagwa, Robert] Tanzania Wildlife Res Inst, Arusha, Tanzania; [Jackson, Craig; Fossoy, Frode] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway; [Holmern, Tomas] Norwegian Environm Agcy, Trondheim, Norway",,"Mbise, FP (corresponding author), Univ Dodoma, Dept Conservat Biol, POB 338, Dodoma, Tanzania.",francombise@gmail.com,"MBISE, FRANCO/AAT-2739-2021; Jackson, Craig/AAT-9335-2021","Ranke, Peter S./0000-0003-3757-8626; Mbise, Franco/0000-0002-5825-5984; Roskaft, Eivin/0000-0003-0262-8443",European Commission Horizon 2020 [641918]; Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES),"European Commission Horizon 2020 funded project (Grant Agreement 641918; African BioServices)., Grant/Award Number: 641918; Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)",,58,4,4,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,MAR,2020,126,3,,,,,297,303,,10.1111/eth.12968,,OCT 2019,7,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,KI6AV,WOS:000490639600001,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022-04-19,

Despite these benefits, snakes are historically a target of persecution and negative attitudes across cultures, and many of them are threatened. Understanding the predictors of snake-human conflicts is essential to improve conservation efforts. We investigated the degree to which emotions, myth beliefs, experience with snakes (via exposure, bites, and knowledge of mortality from a snakebite), and education would predict attitudes toward snakes in a sample of southeastern Nigerian people. We further examined whether attitudes would predict intentional killing of snakes. Ordinal regression analyses revealed that fear, disgust, and belief in the myth that snakes are evil were related to low tolerance of snakes. More frequent encounters with snakes and higher education were associated with higher tolerance of snakes. Furthemore, higher tolerance of snakes was associated with a reduced likelihood of intentionally killing snakes, even when controlling for the influence of the other psychological and experiential variables. Wildlife management education interventions may be important to change attitudes and decrease intentional killing of snakes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

These disturbances may precede the onset of psychosis and may underlie early social and emotional problems. In this study, we examined self-referential processing in a group of children (7-12 years) at familial high risk (FHR) for psychosis (N = 17), compared to an age and sex-matched group of healthy control (HC) children (N = 20). The participants were presented with a list of adjectives and asked to indicate whether or not the adjectives described them (self-reference condition) and whether the adjectives described a good or bad trait (semantic condition). Three participants were excluded due to chance-level performance on the semantic task, leaving N = 15 FHR and N = 19 HC for final analysis. Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to measure brain activation during self-referential vs. semantic processing. Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Evaluating main effects of task (self > semantic) showed activation of medial prefrontal cortex in HC and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in FHR. Group-comparison yielded significant results for the FHR > HC contrast, showing two clusters of hyperactivation in precuneus/ PCC (p = 0.004) and anterior cerebellum / temporo-occipital cortex (p = 0.009). Greater precuneus/PCC activation was found to correlate with greater CBCL internalizing (r = 0.60, p = 0.032) and total (r = 0.69, p = 0.009) problems. In all, this study shows hyperactivity of posterior DMN during self-referential processing in pre-adolescent FHR children. This finding posits DMN-related disturbances in self-processing as a developmental brain abnormality associated with familial risk factors that predates not just psychosis, but also the prodromal stage. Moreover, our results suggest that early disturbances in self-referential processing may be related to internalizing problems in at-risk children.","[Collin, Guusje; Bauer, Clemens C.

The adverse neuro-behavioural effects of Se have been investigated in both humans and fishes, but little is known about its effects on social behaviours or the serotonergic signaling pathway in the brain. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chorionic dietary exposure to Se (as selenomethionine) at different concentrations (control, 2.1, 11.6 or 31.5 mu g/g dry wt.) on antipredator avoidance, shoaling behaviour, and social group preferences in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, we also measured the expression of important genes in the serotonergic pathway that influence social behaviours. After 60 days of exposure, the highest dose (31.5 mu g/g dry wt.) caused the highest level of baseline fear behaviour, with fish swimming lower in the water column and in tighter shoals compared to fish in the other treatments. With high levels of baseline fear, these fish did not significantly intensify fear behaviours in response to predation risk in the form of exposure to chemical alarm cues. When individual fish were given an opportunity to shoal with groups of differing sizes (3 vs. 4 individuals), fish exposed to the high dose spent less time with groups in general, and only control fish showed a significant preference for the larger group. In the zebrafish brain, we found significant upregulation in the mRNA expression of serotonin receptors (htrlaa and htrl b), a transporter (slc6a4a), and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (tph2), whereas there was a downregulation of the monoamine oxidase (mao) gene. The results of this study suggest that disruption of serotonergic neurotransmission might have been responsible for Se-induced impairment of antipredator and social behaviour in zebrafish.

However, less is known about whether prey species modify their behavior in response to predator body and behavioral cues. Recent studies indicated that tufted titmice, a small songbird, decreased their foraging behavior and increased their calling rates when they detected a potential predator facing toward a feeder they were using, compared to a potential predator facing away from that feeder. Here, we tested whether related Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis, were also sensitive not just to the presence of a predator model, but to its facial/head orientation. Although chickadees are closely related to titmice, recent studies in different populations suggest chickadees respond to risky contexts involving predators differently than titmice. We conducted two field studies near feeders the birds were exploiting. In Study One, a mask-wearing human observer stood near the feeder. In Study Two, a model of a domestic cat was positioned near the feeder. In both studies, the potential threatening stimulus either faced toward or faced away from the feeder. Chickadees avoided the feeder more in both studies when the potential predator was present, and showed strongest feeder avoidance when the potential predator faced toward the feeder. Chickadee calling behavior was also affected by the facial orientation of the potential predator in Study 1. These results suggest that, like titmice, chickadees exhibit predation-risk-sensitive foraging and calling behavior, in relation to facial and head orientation of potential threats. These small birds seem to attend to the likely visual space of potential predators. Sensitivity to predator cues like behavior and body posture must become more central to our theories and models of anti-predator behavioral systems.","[Freeberg, Todd M.; Book, D.

Heron response declined through the nesting period and the level of response varied among colonies, suggesting different perceptions of risk among groups of herons in the study. It was experimentally shown that variation in the response of herons through one nesting period was due to both behavioural habituation and the stage of the nesting period. Response was stronger in 1999 than in 1998, indicating that habituation did not hold between nesting periods. In general, habituation in herons may bode well for their potential to persist in areas with tight human use. But irrespective of habituation, stimuli early in the nesting period and large or novel events may still cause herons to abandon their nests owing to the effects of the stage of the nesting period.","[Vennesland, Ross G.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",,"Vennesland, RG (corresponding author), Pk Canada Agcy, 300-300 W Georgia St, Vancouver, BC V6B 6B4, Canada.",rgv@sfu.ca,,,Habitat Conservation Trust Fund; Rob Butler; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"I am grateful to both Rob Butler and Ron Ydenberg for their efforts as my graduate supervisors.

Leopard-livestock conflict is a contentious issue in the Baviaanskloof Mega-Reserve (BMR), South Africa. Little is known about the spatial distribution of livestock losses and the associated management responses by farmers. We investigated the vegetation-specific livestock predation by leopards in the BMR, as well as the consequences for livestock management and biodiversity preservation. Leopard killed livestock in 14 of the 22 vegetation types, of which Groot Valley Thicket, Cockscomb Mountain Fynbos and Baviaanskloof Mountain Fynbos were 'used' more than expected. Leopard predation was focused on the properties that bordered the reserve, but constituted a relatively small proportion of livestock losses on these properties. Farmers respond to this actual predation and perceived predation by removing livestock from areas bordering the reserve. Given the high levels of herbivory exerted on the vegetation by livestock, the removal of livestock may create plant refugia from herbivory. Thus, we propose that leopard predation may induce human-mediated behavioural effects on livestock which resembles the behavioural responses of herbivores to 'landscapes of fear'. Therefore, retaining top predators may assist in the conservation of biodiversity within multi-use landscapes by maintaining predator-prey dynamics and associated top-down processes.","[Minnie, Liaan; Boshoff, Andre F.; Kerley, Graham I.

We studied how varying levels of human, disturbance influence this function in the mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) along the southern coastal plain of Israel. Based on current theory, we predicted that changes in the slope of this function should be associated with changes in average group size. In heavily disturbed areas, individual vigilance levels increased in the bigger groups, causing the vigilance vs. group size curve to flatten, i.e., vigilance was high in all group sizes. Consequently, and in accordance with theory, we found a negative relationship between group size and human disturbance. Specifically, we found that-in open areas with low disturbance levels, gazelles wore in bigger groups than in open areas with high disturbance levels. In social species, the disruption of behavioral patterns by increased human presence can affect their social structure. Because social structure is a key component in the evolution and dynamics of social species, its disruption by human disturbance can have a considerable effect on population performance even if the disturbance does not, directly impact survival and reproduction. Social disruption due to increased access to natural areas should be an important consideration in managing fragmented landscapes.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel",,"Manor, R (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Sde Boker Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",,"SALTZ, DAVID/F-1581-2012; Saltz, David/AAC-7054-2019","Saltz, David/0000-0002-7437-0472",,,,22,72,80,2,58,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

To qualify such behavioral plasticity we measured the degree to which gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) exploited sunflower seeds in pans distributed over an urban-rural gradient of 78 sites in Virginia. Our objective was to use squirrel GUDs as a functional, relativistic measure of the effects of urbanization. Results showed that a higher proportion of pans were foraged from and that the GUDs were lower (more seeds were removed) in relatively high-density urban and suburban areas than in more rural agricultural areas, or in relatively human-free forest controls. For sites near or within human settlements, GUDs were lower nearer to human-occupied structures than at a greater distance from them, where more squirrels were observed, and where the density of trees was higher; GUDs were higher where there was substantial ground cover and where domestic pets (i.e., cats/dogs) were present nearby. Squirrels living in close proximity to humans appear to be either more limited by food or less sensitive to predatory risk than those living in more natural areas. We argue that the GUD represents a valuable metric with utility for measuring the separate and combined impact of anthropogenic actions at the individual and population levels.","UNIV VIRGINIA, BLANDY EXPTL FARM, BOYCE, VA 22620 USA",,"Bowers, MA (corresponding author), UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT ENVIRONM SCI, POB 175, BOYCE, VA 22620 USA.",,,,,,,36,93,96,42,432,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

However, bycatch risk may differ on temporal and spatial scales due to the uneven distribution and effort of fleets operating different fishing gear, and to focal species distribution and foraging behavior. Scopoli's shearwater Calonectris diomedea is a long-lived seabird that experiences high bycatch rates in longline fisheries and strong population-level impacts due to this type of anthropogenic mortality. Analyzing a long-term dataset on individual monitoring, we compared adult survival (by means of multi-event capture-recapture models) among three close predator-free Mediterranean colonies of the species. Unexpectedly for a long-lived organism, adult survival varied among colonies. We explored potential causes of this differential survival by (1) measuring egg volume as a proxy of food availability and parental condition; (2) building a specific longline bycatch risk map for the species; and (3) assessing the distribution patterns of breeding birds from the three study colonies via GPS tracking. Egg volume was very similar between colonies over time, suggesting that environmental variability related to habitat foraging suitability was not the main cause of differential survival. On the other hand, differences in foraging movements among individuals from the three colonies expose them to differential mortality risk, which likely influenced the observed differences in adult survival. The overlap of information obtained by the generation of specific bycatch risk maps, the quantification of population demographic parameters, and the foraging spatial analysis should inform managers about differential sensitivity to the anthropogenic impact at mesoscale level and guide decisions depending on the spatial configuration of local populations. The approach would apply and should be considered in any species where foraging distribution is colony-specific and mortality risk varies spatially.","[Genovart, Meritxell; Igual, Jose-Manuel; Oro, Daniel] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Esporles, Mallorca, Spain; [Genovart, Meritxell; Oro, Daniel] CSIC, CEAB, Acces Cala St Francesc, Girona, Catalonia, Spain; [Becares, Juan; Rodriguez, Beneharo; Arcos, Jose M.] SEO BirdLife Marine Programme, Delegacio Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain; [Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro] Univ A Coruna, Dept Biol, Grp Invest Biol Evolut, La Coruna, Spain; [Escandell, Raul] SOM, Es Castell, Menorca, Spain; [Sanchez, Antonio] Ayuntamiento Valencia, Oficina Tecn Devesa Albufera, Valencia, Spain; [Rodriguez, Beneharo] Canary Isl Ornithol & Nat Hist Grp GOHNIC, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain",,"Genovart, M (corresponding author), IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Esporles, Mallorca, Spain.",xell@imedea.uib-csic.es,"Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012; Igual, Jose M/N-3975-2014; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/G-4522-2016; Genovart, Meritxell/L-4873-2014","Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007; Igual, Jose M/0000-0002-8369-3150; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/0000-0001-8009-4331; Genovart, Meritxell/0000-0003-2919-1288; Rodriguez, Beneharo/0000-0002-9946-3421","European UnionEuropean Commission [LIFE04NAT/ES/000049, LIFE07NAT/E/000732]; Regional Government of the Balearic Islands [PD/023/2015]; Spanish Ministry of the EconomySpanish Government [CGL2013-42203-R]; Consell Insular de Menorca; H2020 Environment [RIA-MINOUW, H2020-634495]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Universidade da Coruna; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [GRC2014/050]","European Union, Grant/Award Number: LIFE04NAT/ES/000049, LIFE07NAT/E/000732; Regional Government of the Balearic Islands, Grant/Award Number: PD/023/2015; Spanish Ministry of the Economy, Grant/Award Number: CGL2013-42203-R; Consell Insular de Menorca; H2020 Environment, Grant/Award Number: RIA-MINOUW Grant, ref.

Factors that may affect FID can be altered by human-stimulated predation risk, although the magnitude of response may depend on human exposure. We investigated how FID and distance to refuge of foraging eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis Gmelin, 1788), vary in seven sites corresponding to three levels of human exposure. We predicted that both FID and distance to refuge increase as exposure to human stimuli decreases; FID increases with the starting distance of the approaching human; and Flu increases with distance to refuge. We found that FID increased with decreasing human exposure and that FID increased with increasing starting distance. We found no difference in distance to refuge between exposure levels. Our results suggest that risk posed to gray squirrels in areas frequently visited by humans is minimized or reduced, leading to differences in MD between exposure levels and may be attributed to habituation to increased nonlethal stimuli in the form of exposure to humans.","[Engelhardt, S.

Since social learning allows animals to capitalize on the risk-taking of others, and avoid endangering themselves, social learning should be used around novel and unpredictable stimuli. However, it is unclear whether animals use social cues equally around all types of novelty and at all times of year. We assessed whether wild, individually marked jackdaws-a highly neophobic, yet adaptable species-are equally influenced by social cues to consume novel, palatable foods and to approach a startling object. We conducted these tests across two seasons, and found that in both seasons observers were more likely to consume novel foods after seeing a demonstrator do so. In contrast, observers only followed the demonstrator in foraging next to the object during breeding season. Throughout the year more birds were wary of consuming novel foods than wary of approaching the object, potentially leading to jackdaws' greater reliance on social information about food. Jackdaws' dynamic social cue usage demonstrates the importance of context in predicting how social information is used around novelty, and potentially indicates the conditions that facilitate animals' adjustment to anthropogenic disturbance.","[Greggor, Alison L.; Clayton, Nicola S.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [McIvor, Guillam E.; Thornton, Alex] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England",,"Greggor, AL (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.; Thornton, A (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England.",alg61@cam.ac.uk; alex.thornton@exeter.ac.uk,"Greggor, Alison/H-6956-2019; McIvor, Guillam E./H-6602-2019","Greggor, Alison/0000-0003-0998-618X; McIvor, Guillam E./0000-0003-3922-7651; Thornton, Alex/0000-0002-1607-2047; Clayton, Nicola/0000-0003-1835-423X","Gates-Cambridge Trust; BBSRC David Phillips FellowshipUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H021817/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H021817/2, BB/H021817/1] Funding Source: researchfish; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H021817/1, BB/H021817/2] Funding Source: UKRI","We are very grateful to Paul Gluyas and the staff at Pencoose farm and to Stithians Parish Council for allowing us to work on their land.

We hypothesized that human activities and infrastructure cause a decrease in the individual performance of preys because of anthropogenically enhanced predation risk. We evaluated the impacts of commercial logging and road networks on the fitness of a large herbivore known to be sensitive to human disturbance: the forest-dwelling woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). For 8 consecutive years (2004-2011) we monitored 59 individuals using GPS telemetry in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Canada. We also used Very High Frequency telemetry locations collected on 28 individuals from 1999-2000. We related habitat selection of adult caribou at various spatio-temporal scales to their probability of dying from predation, and to indices of their reproductive success and energy expenditure. The probability that adult caribou died from predation increased with the proportion of recent disturbances (including cutblocks <= 5 years old) in their annual home range. The respective effects of increasing paved and forestry road densities depended upon the overall road density within the home range of caribou. At a finer scale of 10 to 15 days before their death, caribou that were killed by a predator selected for recent disturbances more than individuals that survived, and avoided old mature conifer stands. The home range area of caribou increased with road density. Finally, the composition of the home range of females had no effect on their reproductive success. We show that human activities and infrastructure may influence the individual performance of large prey species in highly managed regions. We outline the need to consider the full set of impacts that human development may have on threatened animal populations, with particular emphasis on predator-prey relationships and population dynamics.","[Leblond, Mathieu; Ouellet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Leblond, Mathieu; Ouellet, Jean-Pierre] Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Dussault, Christian] Minist Dev Durable Environm Faune & Parc Quebec, Direct Faune Terrestre & Avifaune, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",,"Leblond, M (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",mathieu_leblond@uqar.ca,"Leblond, Mathieu/J-9646-2019","Leblond, Mathieu/0000-0002-2833-6265",Ministere des Transports du Quebec; Endangered Species Recovery Fund; Fondation de la faune du Quebec; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Funding was provided by the Ministere des Transports du Quebec (www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca), the Endangered Species Recovery Fund (wwf.panda.org), the Fondation de la faune du Quebec (www.fondationdelafaune.qc.ca), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca).

We find that cooperation is the only strategy that survives the harshest of environments and that humans opt for riskier, more cooperative strategies when their energy supply is depleted. Together the results show the significant role environmental harshness plays in human cooperative dynamics and the species-unique cognition designed to support it. It has been proposed that environmental stress acted as a selection pressure on the evolution of human cooperation. Through agent-based evolutionary modelling, mathematical analysis, and human experimental data we illuminate the mechanisms by which the environment influences cooperative success and decision making in a Stag Hunt game. The modelling and mathematical results show that only cooperative foraging phenotypes survive the harshest of environments but pay a penalty for miscoordination in favourable environments. When agents are allowed to coordinate their hunting intentions by communicating, cooperative phenotypes outcompete those who pursue individual strategies in almost all environmental and payoff scenarios examined. Data from human participants show flexible decision-making in face of cooperative uncertainty, favouring high-risk, high-reward strategy when environments are harsher and starvation is imminent. Converging lines of evidence from the three approaches indicate a significant role for environmental variability in human cooperative dynamics and the species-unique cognition designed to support it.","[Ibbotson, Paul; Jimenez-Romero, Cristian] Open Univ, Fac Wellbeing Educ & Language Studies, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Page, Karen M.] UCL, Dept Math, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",,"Ibbotson, P (corresponding author), Open Univ, Fac Wellbeing Educ & Language Studies, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.",paul.ibbotson@open.ac.uk,,,,,,87,1,1,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

To test this hypothesis, we estimated diet composition for red deer in the Scottish highlands in spring, when recreational activity tends to be high, and in winter when it is lower. We analysed faecal samples from three habitat types (grassland, heather moorland and woodland) collected at sites close to a busy track (disturbed) and at a distance from it (less disturbed). The diet consisted of 39% grasses, sedges, herbs and rushes (GSHR) and 58% Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp. (heather) in spring, compared with 14% grasses and 77% heather in winter, with small quantities of Vaccinium spp. (berry) and Pinus sylvestris (tree) in both seasons. In spring, faeces from disturbed grass and woodland sites indicated a diet with less GSHR and more heather and tree than faeces from less-disturbed sites, which could be due to an increased need for vigilance in exposed grassland and the need to seek cover. In contrast, faeces from all disturbed sites in winter indicated a diet with more GSHR and less heather than faeces from less-disturbed sites. This could be due to a seasonal decline in recreation and increase in hunting activity reversing the disturbance levels at the different sites, since hunting is not normally carried out in areas used by the public for recreation. We conclude that there may be nutritional benefits to deer of reducing disturbance near open grassland.","[Jayakody, Sevvandi; Sibbald, Angela M.; Mayes, Robert W.; Hooper, Russell J.] Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Gordon, Iain J.] CSIRO Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia; [Jayakody, Sevvandi; Lambin, Xavier] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland",,"Sibbald, AM (corresponding author), Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",angela.sibbald@macaulay.ac.uk,"Gordon, Iain J/K-8636-2012; Lambin, Xavier/E-8284-2011; Gordon, Iain/S-8076-2019","Gordon, Iain J/0000-0001-9704-0946; Lambin, Xavier/0000-0003-4643-2653; Gordon, Iain/0000-0001-9704-0946; Jayakody, Sevvandi/0000-0001-9600-4986",Commonwealth Scholarship Association (UK); Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (now the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate),This research was funded by the Commonwealth Scholarship Association (UK) and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (now the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate).

For example, models of predation events for moving prey groups predict higher mortality risk for individuals at the periphery and front of groups. We investigated these predictions in sardine (Sardinella aurita) schools under attack from group hunting sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) in the open ocean. Sailfish approached sardine schools about equally often from the front and rear, but prior to attack there was a chasing period in which sardines attempted to swim away from the predator. Consequently, all sailfish attacks were directed at the rear and peripheral positions of the school, resulting in higher predation risk for individuals at these positions. During attacks, sailfish slash at sardines with their bill causing prey injury including scale removal and tissue damage. Sardines injured in previous attacks were more often found in the rear half of the school than in the front half. Moreover, injured fish had lower tail-beat frequencies and lagged behind uninjured fish. Injuries inflicted by sailfish bills may, therefore, hinder prey swimming speed and drive spatial sorting in prey schools through passive self-assortment. We found only partial support for the theoretical predictions from current predator-prey models, highlighting the importance of incorporating more realistic predator-prey dynamics into these models.

If these differences extend to pertinent natural environmental changes, which indicate changing predation or starvation threat, then personality may reflect important variation in how animals manage risk. We examined whether personality traits classified in captivity would predict the behavioral flexibility of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus as they foraged in the wild. Behavioral flexibility was defined as the tendency to adjust feeder use with changing winter air temperature, an indicator of starvation risk. At the population level, birds reduced their feeder use on warm days. Individuals, though, varied widely, with some instead using feeders at a relatively fixed, temperature-independent rate. Sex and size, correlates of dominance in blue tits, did not predict behavioral flexibility. Instead, behavioral flexibility was predicted by age and 2 personality traits: old, neophobic, and exploratory birds were more behaviorally flexible than young, neophilic, and nonexploratory birds. Our findings suggest that personality types differ in how they use information about their environments and hence cope with environmental change.A bird's response to the weather depends on their personality. Individual birds, like humans, respond differently to the same novel or threatening situations. In winter, when starvation risk is greatest, blue tits varied in foraging strategy. Shy but exploratory individuals adjusted their feeder use with air temperature, feeding most on cold days. Bold but less exploratory individuals fed at a fixed rate all winter. Thus, personality may predict how individuals cope with environmental change.","[Herborn, Katherine A.; Arnold, Kathryn E.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Heidinger, Britt J.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fargo, ND 58102 USA; [Alexander, Lucille] WALTHAM Ctr Pet Nutr, Melton Mowbray LE14 4RT, England; [Arnold, Kathryn E.] Univ York, Environm Dept, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",,"Herborn, KA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",katherine.herborn@glasgow.ac.uk,"Arnold, Kathryn E/F-8683-2016; Herborn, Katherine/Q-4412-2019","Arnold, Kathryn E/0000-0002-6485-6065; Herborn, Katherine/0000-0002-5913-7912",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Industrial Case studentshipUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); WALTHAM(R) [BBS/S/M/2006/13139]; Royal Society University Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London,K.H. was funded by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Industrial Case studentship with WALTHAM (R) (BBS/S/M/2006/13139) and K.

In this context, tonic immobility (TI) behavior is an innate response associated with extreme threat situations, such as predator attack. Some reports have demonstrated the involvement of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in regulation of the endocrine system, defensive behaviors and behavioral responses to stress. Particularly, a previous study showed that the activation of CRF receptors in the basolateral (BLA) or central (CeA) nuclei of the amygdala increased TI responses, whereas treatment with a non-selective CRF antagonist, alpha-helical-CRF9-41, decreased this innate fear response. However, while CRF1 receptors have pronounced effects in stress-induced anxiety, CRF2 receptors appear be involved in the expression of both stress-induced anxiety and spontaneous anxiety behavior. In this study, we investigated the effects of specific CRF receptors, CRF1 and CRF2, in the BLA and CeA on the duration of TI in guinea pigs. The results show that blockade of CRF1 and CRF2 receptors in the BLA and CeA produces a decrease in fear and/or anxiety, as suggested by a decrease in TI duration in the guinea pigs. Additionally, the specific antagonists for CRF1 and CRF2 receptors were able to prevent the increase in TI duration induced by CRF administration at the same sites. These results suggest that the modulation of fear and anxiety by the CRF system in the BLA and CeA occurs through concomitant effects on CRF1 and CRF2 receptors.","[Spinieli, Richard Leandro; Andrade Leite-Panissi, Christie Ramos] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Philosophy Sci & Literature Ribeirao Preto, Psychobiol Grad Program, BR-14040901 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Andrade Leite-Panissi, Christie Ramos] Univ Sdo Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Dent Sch, Dept Morphol Physiol & Basic Pathol, BR-14040904 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil",,"Leite-Panissi, CRA (corresponding author), Univ Sdo Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Dent Sch, Dept Morphol Physiol & Basic Pathol, BR-14040904 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",christie@forp.usp.br,"Leite-Panissi, Christie Ramos Andrade/A-2011-2013","Leite-Panissi, Christie Ramos Andrade/0000-0003-1762-2730",CAPES/PROEXCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [307383/2012-1]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/10936-5],"The authors would like to thank Patricia Adriana Basile for her technical assistance.

We examined the degree to which two songbirds, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis, n = 160 pairs) and the Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens, n = 70 pairs), changed nest-site attributes (e.g., nest height, nest concealment, and vegetation density surrounding the nests) between subsequent within-season nesting attempts from 2006 to 2010 in Ohio. Specifically, we asked if birds adjusted nest-sites based upon information such as prior experience with nest predation, predator abundance, and predation risk. We predicted that, in cases where previous nests failed (private information) and/or sites had a greater risk of nest predation (public information), birds would make greater changes in nest characteristics such as nest height, concealment, and the vegetation density surrounding the nest to make presumably safer nest sites. Only cardinals, not flycatchers, showed evidence of using private and public information in changing nest-site attributes. There were greater changes in nest height when previous nests failed, and greater changes in nest concealment at riskier sites compared to those with low daily predation rates. These findings suggest that species differ in behavioral plasticity and use of information in ways that can both reflect and predict their ability to adapt to novel conditions.","[Kearns, Laura J.; Rodewald, Amanda D.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43202 USA",,"Kearns, LJ (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, 2021 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43202 USA.",kearns.9@buckeyemail.osu.edu,"Rodewald, Amanda D/I-6308-2016","Rodewald, Amanda D/0000-0002-6719-6306","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0340879, DEB-0639429]; Ohio Division of Wildlife through the State Wildlife Grant program; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through the State Wildlife Grant programUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center","Funding for this research was provided by NSF DEB-0340879 and DEB-0639429 to A.

Forest leopards are an apex predator of primates in African rain forests and may represent a significant risk to ape populations. More field data are needed to further elucidate the behavioural modifications of apes in response to predation.

In many cases, animals living near humans become tolerant of them and reduce antipredator responses. Yet, we still lack an understanding of the underlying evolutionary dynamics behind these shifts in traits that affect animal survival. Here, we used a phylogenetic meta-analysis to determine how the mean and variability in antipredator responses change as a function of the number of generations spent in contact with humans under 3 different contexts: urbanization, captivity, and domestication. We found that any contact with humans leads to a rapid reduction in mean antipredator responses as expected. Notably, the variance among individuals over time observed a short-term increase followed by a gradual decrease, significant for domesticated animals. This implies that intense human contact immediately releases animals from predation pressure and then imposes strong anthropogenic selection on traits. In addition, our results reveal that the loss of antipredator traits due to urbanization is similar to that of domestication but occurs 3 times more slowly. Furthermore, the rapid disappearance of antipredator traits was associated with 2 main life-history traits: foraging guild and whether the species was solitary or gregarious (i.e., group-living). For domesticated animals, this decrease in antipredator behavior was stronger for herbivores than for omnivores or carnivores and for solitary than for gregarious species. By contrast, the decrease in antipredator traits was stronger for gregarious, urbanized species, although this result is based mostly on birds. Our study offers 2 major insights on evolution in the Anthropocene: (1) changes in traits occur rapidly even under unintentional human interventions (i.e., urbanization) and (2) there are similarities between the selection pressures exerted by domestication and by urbanization. In all, such changes could affect animal survival in a predator-rich world, but through understanding evolutionary dynamics, we can better predict when and how exposure to humans modify these fitness-related traits.","[Geffroy, Benjamin; Sadoul, Bastien] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, CNRS, IFREMER,IRD, Palavas Les Flots, France; [Putman, Breanna J.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Putman, Breanna J.] Nat Hist Museum Angeles Cty, Dept Herpetol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Putman, Breanna J.] Urban Nat Res Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Berger-Tal, Oded] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] Inst Ecol & Bot, Ctr Ecol Res, Vacratot, Hungary; [Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] Eotvos Lorand Univ, MTA ELTE, Theoret Biol & Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Dept Plant Systemat Ecol & Theoret Biol, Budapest, Hungary; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Paris, France; [Moller, Anders Pape] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Putman, Breanna J.] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Biol, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA",,"Geffroy, B (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, CNRS, IFREMER,IRD, Palavas Les Flots, France.",bgeffroy@ifremer.fr,"Berger-Tal, Oded/P-9189-2014; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-1670-2019; Geffroy, Benjamin/D-1541-2012; Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt/M-1488-2015","Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X; Geffroy, Benjamin/0000-0001-6120-1103; Sadoul, Bastien/0000-0001-5968-3983; Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt/0000-0001-8920-2183","National Research, the Development and Innovation Office in Hungary [K129215]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council","LZG is supported by the National Research, the Development and Innovation Office in Hungary (K129215).

If native large carnivores perceive dogs as threatening, impacts could extend to the community level by altering interactions between large carnivores and their prey. Dog impacts may be further exacerbated if these human-associated predators are also perceived as indicators of risk from humans. However, observational approaches used to date have led to ambiguity regarding the effects of dog presence on wildlife. We experimentally quantified dog impacts on the behavior of a native large carnivore, presenting playbacks of dog vocalizations to pumas in central California. We show that the perceived presence of dogs has minimal impacts on puma behavior at their kill sites, and is no more likely to affect total feeding time at kills than non-threatening controls. We previously demonstrated that pumas exhibit strong responses to human cues, and here show that perceived risk from human presence far exceeds that from dogs. Our results suggest that protected areas management policies that restrict dogs but permit human access may in some cases be of limited value for large carnivores.","[Suraci, Justin P.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Clinchy, Michael; Zanette, LianaY] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Suraci, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",justin.suraci@gmail.com,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We thank R.

Using a standardized walking approach method on focal bird individuals, we investigated whether different levels of vegetation cover (habitat) influence the perception of predation risk. To do this, we worked in an area of tropical dry forest in central Mexico that is currently part of a restoration ecology experiment. We hypothesized that restoration decreases individual's predation risk perception by increasing the complexity of the vegetation cover. The escape responses of three tropical birds with different diets and foraging strategies were also contrasted. There was no effect of habitat on FID, suggesting that birds in both habitats perceived predation risk in a similar manner. There was, however, a difference in FID among species: the Golden-cheeked Woodpecker tolerated closer human presence before flight than the Inca Dove and Streak-backed Oriole. This difference is likely due to the use of an alternative avoidance strategy of this species, which uses trunks for hiding. To decrease birds' perceived predation risk, restoration intervention plans should include a mosaic of larger excluded plots located near relatively well-conserved sites to increase the area covered by vegetation.","[Osorio-Beristain, Marcela; Rodriguez, Angeles; Martinez-Garza, Cristina; Ernesto Alcala, Raul] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Conservac, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico",,"Osorio-Beristain, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Conservac, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico.",mosorio@uaem.mx,"Martínez-Garza, Cristina/K-4519-2019; Martínez-Garza, Cristina/H-8956-2019","Martínez-Garza, Cristina/0000-0002-9310-564X; ",Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente en Educacion Superior UAEMOR-CA [56]; Individual Project from the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos; CMG by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [80027],"This study was funded by the Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente en Educacion Superior UAEMOR-CA 56.

Starving rodents, for example, will forage in areas that are more susceptible to predators and will also modulate aggressive behavior within a territory of limited or depleted nutrients. The neural basis of these adaptive behaviors likely involves circuits that link innate feeding, aggression and fear. Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are critically important for driving feeding and project axons to brain regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping techniques in mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which suppresses territorial aggression and reduces contextual fear. We propose that AgRP neurons serve as a master switch capable of coordinating behavioral decisions relative to internal state and environmental cues.","[Padilla, Stephanie L.; Barker, Forrest D.; Palmiter, Richard D.] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Qiu, Jian; Nestor, Casey C.; Ronnekleiv, Oline K.; Kelly, Martin J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Soden, Marta E.; Zweifel, Larry S.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Soden, Marta E.; Zweifel, Larry S.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharmacol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sanz, Elisenda; Quintana, Albert] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Neurociencies, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanz, Elisenda; Quintana, Albert] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Biol Cellular Fisiol & Immunol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Ronnekleiv, Oline K.; Kelly, Martin J.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Oregon Natl Primate Res Ctr, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR USA",,"Padilla, SL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",slp23@uw.edu,"Zweifel, Larry/O-3284-2017; Sanz, Elisenda/I-2765-2015; Quintana, Albert/N-5544-2015","Zweifel, Larry/0000-0003-3465-5331; Sanz, Elisenda/0000-0002-7932-8556; Nestor, Casey/0000-0001-5939-2131; Quintana, Albert/0000-0003-1674-7160; Soden, Marta/0000-0002-0695-8653","Hilda Preston Davis Foundation; US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01DK068098, R01NS038809, R01MH094536, R01DA024908]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie award [H2020-MSCA-IF-2014-658352]; Ramon y Cajal fellowshipSpanish Government [RyC-2012-11873]; European Research Council Starting Grant NEUROMITO [ERC-2014-StG-638106]; MINECO Proyectos I+D de Excelencia [SAF2014-57981P]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [R01DK068098] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH094536] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R01NS038809] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA024908] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank K.

Addressing this lack of knowledge, we used low-productive laying hens (n = 93) and assessed behavioral responses to an open-field test [at 17, 18, 29, 33 weeks of age (wa)], an aerial predator test (at 39 wa), and a social reinstatement test (at 42 wa). Bone condition was assessed using a palpation technique on five occasions (at 16, 29, 33, 45, 58 wa), with half of the hens experiencing damage (deviations, fractures, or both) at 29 wa and all hens by 58 wa. Corticosterone (CORT) concentration in feathers (at 16, 33, 58 wa) and body weight (at 23, 47, 58 wa) were also investigated. We hypothesized that lighter birds (at 23 wa) with higher CORT (at 16 wa) and open field-induced fear collected before the onset of lay (at 17 and 18 wa) are associated with a worse bone condition when in lay. We also hypothesized that those birds with more damage at the peak of laying (at 29 wa) would be lighter at 47 and 58 wa and more fearful by showing higher open field-induced (at 29 and 33 wa) and predator-induced fear responses, however, acting less socially toward conspecifics. These hens were also expected to have higher CORT (at 33 and 58 wa). Our results show no association between open-field fear level and fear behavior, CORT concentration, or body weight on the one hand (all measured before starting to lay) and bone damage at 29 wa on the other. When in lay, bone damage was associated with more pecking and less crossing zones when faced with an open-field situation at 29 wa and improved sociality at 42 wa. This study provides the first evidence of a relationship of bone health with fear, sociality, and stress response. When in poor bone condition, our hens had enhanced psychological stress measured by fear behavior reactivity but not physiological stress measured as feather CORT concentration.","[Rokavec, Neza; Zupan Semrov, Manja] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Anim Sci, Domzale, Slovenia",,"Semrov, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Anim Sci, Domzale, Slovenia.",manja.zupansemrov@bf.uni-lj.si,,,"Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [V4-1604]; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food (MKGP) Slovenia [V4-1604]","This work was a part of the Slovene national project V4-1604 granted by the Slovenian Research Agency and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food (MKGP) Slovenia.",,66,2,2,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-1769,,FRONT VET SCI,Front.

The classical growth/predation risk tradeoff assumes reduced activity as the cause of these declines. However, in many cases these costs cannot be explained by reduced foraging effort or enhanced allocation to defensive structures under predation risk. Here, we tested for a physiological origin of defence costs by measuring oxygen consumption in tadpoles (Rana temporaria) exposed to predation risk over short and long periods of time. The short term reaction was an increase in oxygen consumption, consistent with the fight-or-flight'' response observed in many organisms. The long term reaction showed the opposite pattern: tadpoles reduced oxygen consumption after three weeks exposure to predators, which would act to reduce the growth cost of predator defence. The results point to an instantaneous and reversible stress response to predation risk. This suggests that the tradeoff between avoiding predators and growing rapidly is not caused by changes in metabolic rate, and must be sought in other behavioural or physiological processes.",,,"Steiner, UK (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Zool, Zurich, Switzerland.",usteiner@stanford.edu,"Steiner, Ulrich/AAQ-2713-2021; Steiner, Ulrich K/C-7099-2015","Steiner, Ulrich/0000-0002-1778-5989; Steiner, Ulrich K/0000-0002-1778-5989; Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626",NIA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P01-AG0225000-01] Funding Source: Medline,,,46,70,71,0,64,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"185 BERRY ST, STE 1300, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 7,2009,4,7,,,,,,,e6160,10.1371/journal.pone.0006160,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,468GZ,WOS:000267806400015,19582147,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2022-04-19,

In previous studies, we investigated the effects of captivity on the behaviour of red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) and found that captive populations differed behaviourally as well as genetically. The aim of the present study was to compare the behaviour of two of the previously studied populations, raised under identical conditions. Eggs were collected from birds at Copenhagen zoo (Cop) and Gotala research station (Got) and were incubated and hatched together. Twenty-eight birds (16 Got and 12 Cop) were reared together and tested in eight different behavioural tests, measuring different aspects of fear-related behaviours as well as exploratory and social behaviours. The study revealed several differences in fear-related behaviours between the populations but none in exploratory or social behaviours. In general, one of the populations (Cop) showed more intense fear behaviours than the other (Got), which instead were less fearful in their behaviours. This indicates that breeding animals in captivity may lead to behavioural modifications, which can affect the outcome of reintroductions. The results further suggest that fear-related behaviours are dependent on the genetic background of the animals while social behaviours may be more influenced by the social environment. Since fear-related behaviours, such as predator avoidance and fear of humans, are essential for a life in the wild, these aspects are crucial for the breeding of animals in captivity for conservation purposes.

Increasing urbanization and recreational activities around and within biodiversity hotspots require an understanding of how to reduce the impacts of human disturbance on more than a single species; however, we lack a general framework to study multiple species. One approach is to expand on knowledge about the theory of anti-predator behaviour to understand and predict how different species might respond to humans. 2. We reviewed the literature and found that only 21% of studies that used a behavioural approach to study human disturbance focused on multiple species. These studies identified a number of potential predictive variables. 3. We developed a simulation model that investigates interspecific variation in different parameters of disturbance with variation in human visitation. We found that fitness-related responses, such as the quantity of food consumed by a species, are relatively sensitive to the distance at which animals detect humans, the frequency of disturbance by humans and the interaction of these factors, but are less sensitive to other characteristics. 4. We examined avian alert distance (the distance animals first orientated to an approaching threat, a proxy for detection distance) across 150 species, controlling for phylogenetic effects. We found that larger species had greater alert distances than smaller species, which could increase local spatial and temporal limitations on suitable habitat with increasing human visitation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that body size could be a potential predictor of responses to human disturbance across species, and could be used by managers to make conservation decisions regarding levels of human visitation to a protected site. We suggest that three things are essential to develop predictive models of how different species will respond to human disturbance. First, multiple indicators of disturbance should be studied to select those with lower intraspecific variation for a given study system. Secondly, the species-specific nature of responses should be identified. Thirdly, life history, natural history and other correlates with these species-specific responses must be assessed.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Rhinelander, WI 54501 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012; Zollner, Patrick A/A-8727-2010","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244; Zollner, Patrick A/0000-0001-8263-7029",,,,37,204,223,7,152,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Road salt is a widespread contaminant among freshwater ecosystems, yet a relatively understudied subject in community ecology. Unknown is whether road salt salinization interacts with predatory stress to influence the growth, behavior, or reproduction of freshwater organisms. Using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and zooplankton (Daphnia pulex), we exposed them to variable levels of road salt (NaCl) crossed with the presence or absence of alarm cues or kairomones. Alarm cue reduced trout activity and aggression and increased shoaling behavior. Road salt reduced trout growth in the high compared to moderate salt concentration, but neither concentration was different from the control. There was no interaction between alarm cues and salt for trout. Road salt and predatory stress had an additive effect on Daphnia abundance. Predatory stress decreased Daphnia abundance by 11%. Compared to the control, salt decreased Daphnia abundance by 40% in 860 mg Cl-/L and 79% in 1300 mg Cl-/L, and by the final day abundance was reduced by 85% in 1300 mg Cl-/L. Road salt and predatory stress had an interactive effect on Daphnia reproduction. Predatory stress in control water and moderate salt levels (230 mg -Cl-/L) increased sexual reproduction of Daphnia, but these responses disappeared at high salt concentrations. Thus, road salt could limit reproductive adaptations to natural and anthropogenic stressors in Daphnia. Our results indicate road salt salinization could alter zooplankton population dynamics directly and by interacting with predatory stress, which might affect energy flow through freshwater food webs.","[Hintz, William D.; Relyea, Rick A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA",,"Hintz, WD (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",hintzwd@gmail.com,,"Hintz, William/0000-0002-9755-5314","Polytechnic Institute, IBM; Fund for Lake George","We thank Jeff Inglee of the Warren County Fish Hatchery for providing experimental fish.

Despite evolutionary relevance, comparatively limited work on the appraisal of predation risk and aspects of cognitive ecology and ecoimmunology has been carried out in non-chordate animals. The present study explored the capacity of holothuroid echinoderms to display an immune response to both reactive and anticipatory predatory stressors. Experimental trials and a mix of behavioural, cellular and hormonal markers were used, with a focus on coelomocytes (analogues of mammalian leukocytes), which are the main components of the echinoderm innate immunity. Findings suggest that holothuroids can not only appraise threatening cues (i.e. scent of a predator or alarm signals from injured conspecifics) but prepare themselves immunologically, presumably to cope more efficiently with potential future injuries. The responses share features with recently defined central emotional states and wane after prolonged stress in a manner akin to habituation, which are traits that have rarely been shown in non-vertebrates, and never in echinoderms. Because echinoderms sit alongside chordates in the deuterostome clade, such findings offer unique insights into the adaptive value and evolution of stress responses in animals.","[Hamel, Jean-Francois] Soc Explorat & Valuing Environm SEVE, St Philips, NB A1M 2B7, Canada; [Jobson, Sara; Caulier, Guillaume; Mercier, Annie] Mem Univ, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",,"Mercier, A (corresponding author), Mem Univ, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",amercier@mun.ca,"Mercier, Annie/B-4254-2012",,Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)Canada Foundation for Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI) from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund,"This research was partly supported by grants to AM from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Ocean Frontier Institute (OFI), through an award from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund.

White-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus respond to temporally and spatially predictable threats posed by humans consistent with the landscape of fear theory. However, few studies examining the response of deer to hunting have accounted for the localized nature of risk. To determine if white-tailed deer are able to recognize and respond to risks posed by hunters relative to specific hunting locations, we equipped 38 female white-tailed deer with GPS collars August-December 2013-2015. Deer were generally found to increase use of feeders, food plots, and vulnerability zones during crepuscular and nocturnal periods as the hunting season progressed. However, deer use of areas around hunting stands decreased during the middle of the day and increased at night in the days immediately following a stand being hunted. We detected no change in use of areas around hunting stands during crepuscular hours in days following when a stand was hunted. Our results suggest that female white-tailed deer are able to recognize and respond to localized risks and do so with a gradient of responses based on localized risk history. However, response was only apparent when analysis accounted for the localized nature of risk, suggesting previous studies may have underestimated the ability of deer to respond to such threats.","[Sullivan, Jeffery D.; Ditchkoff, Stephen S.] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Collier, Bret A.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Ruth, Charles R.] South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Columbia, SC USA; [Raglin, Joshua B.] Brosnan Forest, Norfolk Southern Railways, Dorchester, SC USA",,"Ditchkoff, SS (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",ditchss@auburn.edu,,"Ditchkoff, Stephen/0000-0002-7414-5777","South Carolina Department of Natural Resources; Norfolk Southern - Brosnan Forest; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [1005302]","This research was supported by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, and Norfolk Southern - Brosnan Forest.

The mechanisms underlying space use can be understood by simultaneously evaluating habitat selection and movement patterns, and fine-resolution locational data are increasing our ability to do so. We use high-resolution location data and an integrated step-selection analysis to evaluate caribou, moose, bear, and wolf habitat selection and movement behaviour in response to anthropogenic habitat modification, though caribou data were limited. Space-use response to anthropogenic linear features (LFs) by predators and prey is hypothesized to increase predator hunting efficiency and is thus believed to be a leading factor in woodland caribou declines in western Canada. We found that all species moved faster while on LFs. Wolves and bears were also attracted towards LFs, whereas prey species avoided them. Predators and prey responded less strongly and consistently to natural features such as streams, rivers and lakeshores. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that LFs facilitate predator movement and increase hunting efficiency, while prey perceive such features as risky. Understanding the behavioural mechanisms underlying space-use patterns is important in understanding how future land-use may impact predator-prey interactions. Explicitly linking behaviour to fitness and demography will be important to fully understand the implications of management strategies.","[Dickie, Melanie] Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [McNay, Scott R.; Sutherland, Glenn D.] Wildlife Infometr Inc, Mackenzie, BC, Canada; [Cody, Michael] Cenovus Energy Inc, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Avgar, Tal] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA",,"Dickie, M (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",mvezina@ualberta.ca,"Avgar, Tal/W-9520-2019","Avgar, Tal/0000-0002-8764-6976",,,,66,31,31,11,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Identifying predictive neurobehavioral vulnerability markers of substance use and related problems may improve targeted prevention and early intervention initiatives. This review synthesizes 44 longitudinal studies and explores the utility of developmental imbalance models and neurobehavioral addiction frameworks in predicting neural and cognitive patterns that are associated with prospective substance use initiation and escalation among young people. A total of 234 effect sizes were calculated and compared. Findings suggest that aberrant neural structure and function of regions implicated in reward processing, cognitive control, and impulsivity can predate substance use initiation, escalation, and disorder. Functional vulnerability markers of substance use include hyperactivation during reward feedback and risk evaluation in prefrontal and ventral striatal regions, fronto-parietal hypoactivation during working memory, distinctive neural patterns during successful (fronto-parietal hyperactivation) and failed response inhibition (frontal hypoactivation), and related cognitive deficits. Structurally, smaller fronto-parietal and amygdala volume and larger ventral striatal volume predicts prospective substance misuse. Taken together, the findings of this review suggest that neurobehavioral data can be useful in predicting future substance use behaviors. Notably, little to no research has empirically tested the underlying assumptions of widely used theoretical frameworks. To improve the reliability and utility of neurobehavioral data in predicting future substance use behaviors, recommendations for future research are provided.

Although MAOA deficiency is associated with reactive aggression in humans and mice, the involvement of this enzyme in defensive behaviour remains controversial and poorly understood. To address this issue, we tested MAOA knockout (KO) mice in a spectrum of paradigms and settings associated with variable degrees of threat. The presentation of novel inanimate objects induced a significant reduction in exploratory approaches and increase in defensive behaviours, such as tail-rattling, biting and digging. These neophobic responses were context-dependent and particularly marked in the home cage. In the elevated plus- and T-mazes, MAOA KO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates displayed equivalent locomotor activity and time in closed and open arms; however, MAOA KO mice featured significant reductions in risk assessment, as well as unconditioned avoidance and escape. No differences between genotypes were observed in the defensive withdrawal and emergence test. Conversely, MAOA KO mice exhibited a dramatic reduction of defensive and fear-related behaviours in the presence of predator-related cues, such as predator urine or an anaesthetized rat, in comparison with those observed in their WT littermates. The behavioural abnormalities in MAOA KO mice were not paralleled by overt alterations in sensory and microvibrissal functions. Collectively, these results suggest that MAOA deficiency leads to a general inability to appropriately assess contextual risk and attune defensive and emotional responses to environmental cues.","[Godar, Sean C.; Bortolato, Marco; Frau, Roberto; Dousti, Mona; Chen, Kevin; Shih, Jean C.] Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmacol & Pharmaceut Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Shih, Jean C.] Univ So Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Cell & Neurobiol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Frau, Roberto] Univ Cagliari, Dept Neurosci Bernard B Brodie, Monserrato, CA, Italy",,"Shih, JC (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmacol & Pharmaceut Sci, PSC 518,1985 Zonal Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jcshih@usc.edu,"; Bortolato, Marco/J-3772-2014","Frau, Roberto/0000-0002-5922-2404; Bortolato, Marco/0000-0002-4498-9637","MERIT Award [R01MH39085, R37MH39085]; Zumberge Research Individual Grant; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH039085, R37MH039085] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was supported by R01MH39085 and R37MH39085 (MERIT Award) grants and the Boyd and Elsie Welin Professorship (to J.

Alert distance in the habitat with higher levels of human activity was significantly shorter than the alert distance in the habitat with lower levels of human activity. Overall, the alert distance did not differ between the approach by a human alone and the approach by a human with a dog; however, in the high human activity sites (but not the low human activity sites), the presence of the dog increased alert distance in the squirrels. In addition, squirrels tended to initially respond by running more in the high human activity sites, but the presence of the dog increased the number of squirrels whose initial responses were to not run.

In mammalian carnivores, to reduce the risks of negative encounters between competitors, species can employ a strategy of temporal partitioning, adapting activity patterns to limit synchronous activity. This strategy of non-human competitor avoidance, however, may be influenced by the expansion of human activities, which has driven wild mammals towards nocturnality. We hypothesise that the disruption of temporal niche partitioning by humans and their activities could increase temporal overlap between carnivores, enhancing interspecific competition. We reviewed the published literature systematically and employed generalised linear models to evaluate quantitatively the relative influence of a range of human, meteorological and ecological variables on coefficients of temporal overlap within mammalian terrestrial carnivore communities (orders Carnivora and Didelphimorphia) on a global scale. None of the models investigated showed evidence of an impact of humans on temporal partitioning between carnivores on a global scale. This illustrates that temporal avoidance of humans and competitors does not always follow a consistent pattern and that its strength may be context-dependent and relative to other dimensions of niche partitioning (spatial and trophic). Similarly, the regulation of activity patterns may be strongly site-specific and may be influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Temporal avoidance of both humans and competitors by carnivores may take the form of short, reactive responses that do not impact activity patterns in the longer term. Although we did not detect a global disruption of temporal partitioning due to human disturbance, carnivore communities may still experience an increase in interspecific competition in other niche dimensions. Further research would benefit from using controlled experimental designs and investigating multiple dimensions of niche partitioning simultaneously. Finally, we recommend complementing the coefficient of temporal overlap with other metrics of fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions.","[Seveque, Anthony; Gentle, Louise K.; Yarnell, Richard W.; Uzal, Antonio] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers UO CSIC PA, Mieres 33600, Spain",,"Seveque, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0QF, Notts, England.",anthony.seveque@ntu.ac.uk; louise.gentle@ntu.ac.uk; jv.lopezbao@gmail.com; richard.yarnell@ntu.ac.uk; antonio.uzal@ntu.ac.uk,,"Seveque, Anthony/0000-0003-4363-4137","Nottingham Trent University; Ramon & Cajal research contract from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [RYC-2015-18932]","A.S. received funding from a Nottingham Trent University Vice-Chancellor's bursary scholarship.

The ubiquitous presence of humans in urban areas selects for differential invasion by animals with short flight distances, and adaptation to urban environments results in further reductions in flight distance. Because prey are better able to cope with the proximity of humans than predators due to differences in flight distance, urban areas may act as refuges. Predators on average have a flight distance that is 8 times larger than that of their prey. In urban areas, humans were present within a distance of 54 m (the mean flight distance of raptor species) 16% of the time and 4% of the time within a distance of 7 m (the mean flight distance of prey species). In contrast, humans were present 1.2% of the time within a distance of 54 m but only 0.1% of the time within a distance of 7 m in rural habitats. Therefore, prey gained a 10-fold increase in predator refuge in urban compared with rural habitats. The reduction in flight distance between the ancestral rural and the current urban habitats decreased with the difference in flight distance between raptors and that of prey. The difference in flight distance between predators and that of prey increased with increasing preference of prey by sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus relative to their abundance, providing evidence of a selective advantage for prey. These results suggest that birds that are prey of raptors enjoy a selective advantage from association with humans.","Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, F-91405 Orsay, France",,"Moller, AP (corresponding author), Univ Paris 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Batiment 362, F-91405 Orsay, France.",anders.moller@u-psud.fr,"Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016","Moller, Anders/0000-0003-3739-4675",,,,46,64,68,3,111,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

However, there exists no comprehensive examination of the effects of human disturbance on ungulate escape responses. I conducted a comprehensive review of studies measuring Artiodactyl escape responses (e.g., flight initiation distance, distance moved) to experimental harassment by humans and vehicles, and meta-analyses aimed at predictive questions about the impact of human disturbance on ungulate behavior under an optimization framework. I found evidence across studies that ungulates pay attention to approacher behavior, have greater perceptions of risk when disturbed in open habitats, and females or groups with young offspring show greater flight responses than adult groups. Increased group size and the presence of hunting showed weak but positive heterogeneous effects on flight behavior both between and within species. Humans on foot were more evocative than other stimuli (vehicles, noises). Populations in areas with higher levels of human traffic showed reduced wariness but a lack of alternative sites to move to may explain some of this effect. Hunted populations showed significantly greater flight responses than non-hunted populations. Finally, I suggest five factors to consider when forming predictive models of ungulate flight behavior: (1) how seasonal variation in reproductive status and body condition effects wariness, (2) the relative impacts of lethal and non-lethal human contact, and (3) unique natural history traits that may cause differences in flight behavior between populations, (4) the availability of alternative sites, and (5) shorter distances between feeding sites and refugia can reduce the impact of other factors on flight responses.

We asked whether inland blue-tailed skinks Emoia impar modified their individual antipredator behavior as a function of differential exposure to humans. We conducted multiple consecutive flushes and recorded 2 measures of antipredator response: flight initiation distance (FID), the distance from a threatening stimulus at which an individual flees, and distance fled, the distance an individual fled after a flush. We used a multiple model comparison approach to quantify variation in individual escape behavior across multiple approaches and to test for differences in between-individual variation among populations. We found that individuals tolerated closer approach and fled shorter distances at locations with relatively less human disturbance than at locations with medium and high human disturbance, respectively. In addition, skinks living at high human disturbance sites had less variable FIDs than at low human disturbance sites. Two theories may explain these results. Selection against less favorable phenotypes has reduced behavioral variation in urban habitats and behavioral plasticity allows individuals to flexibly adjust their behavioral patterns in response to human disturbance. These results highlight the importance of studying variation within populations, at the individual level, which may better elucidate the impact that human disturbance has on the behavioral composition of populations.","[Williams, Dana M.; Phat-Tan Nguyen; Chan, Kemal; Krohn, Madeleine; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,,UCLA Office of Instructional Development; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,We thank the UCLA Office of Instructional Development and the UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology for partial support.,,61,6,6,3,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1674-5507,2396-9814,,CURR ZOOL,Curr.

Migration is one behaviour in ungulates that can lead to trade-offs between forage acquisition and predator avoidance. However, when forage intake is limited by food-handling time rather than by food encounter rate, ungulates can reduce foraging costs by synchronizing vigilance with chewing (multitasking). In this study, we compared patterns of vigilance, frequency of multitasking and total foraging time between migrant and resident individuals in a partially migratory elk, Cervus canadensis, population while they were together on their sympatric winter range. We used these comparisons to determine whether one herd segment had an advantage over the other in terms of forage intake and predator avoidance. Using observations of focal individuals, we found that residents were better than migrants at adjusting vigilance levels to spatial variation in wolf, Canis lupus, predation risk associated with a human-caused predation refuge. Migrant elk were less vigilant than residents where wolf predation risk was highest. Residents probably had an advantage over migrants because they were better at mitigating the foraging costs of vigilance by synchronizing vigilance with chewing. Migrant elk did not compensate for higher foraging costs by altering total activity time. Our study shows how foraging behaviours of free-ranging ungulates might contribute to demographic differences that lead to the loss of migratory behaviours.

Specifically, slower 'cognitive' fear responses towards distal threats involve a network of brain regions including the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), while immediate 'reactive' fear responses rely on regions such as the periaqueductal grey(4,5). However, it is unclear how anxiety and its neural substrates relate to these distinct defensive survival circuits. We tested whether individual differences in trait anxiety would impact escape behaviour and neural responses to slow and fast attacking predators: conditions designed to evoke cognitive and reactive fear, respectively. Behaviourally, we found that trait anxiety was not related to escape decisions for fast threats, but individuals with higher trait anxiety escaped earlier during slow threats. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that when subjects faced slow threats, trait anxiety positively correlated with activity in the vHPC, mPFC, amygdala and insula. Furthermore, the strength of functional coupling between two components of the cognitive circuit-the vHPC and mPFC-was correlated with the degree of trait anxiety. This suggests that anxiety predominantly affects cognitive fear circuits that are involved in volitional strategic escape.","[Fung, Bowen J.; Qi, Song; Mobbs, Dean] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Hassabis, Demis] Google DeepMind, London, England; [Daw, Nathaniel] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Fung, BJ; Mobbs, D (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",bjfung@caltech.edu; dmobbs@caltech.edu,,"Fung, Bowen/0000-0001-9177-6725",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [2P50MH094258]; Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute [P2026052]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P50MH094258] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (grant 2P50MH094258 to D.M.) and funds from the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute (P2026052 to D.M.).

Safeguarding habitats that promote prey consumption could enhance populations of facultative or obligate carnivores of conservation concern. We investigated habitat characteristics at 124 sites where radiocollared adult grizzly bears, Ursus arctos (N = 9) consumed ungulates, and we contrasted these sites with paired random sites. We developed a priori models incorporating the potential effects of ungulate and plant food distribution as well as risks of detection by humans and other carnivores on consumption site choice, and evaluated which factors best explain grizzly bear food-caching behaviour. Ungulates were consumed in forested areas, close to edges, and where horizontal cover was high, whereby vegetation impeded visibility of the ungulate carcass. Distance to roads had no effect on the distribution of prey consumption sites, but carcasses were further from trails than expected. Models incorporating presence/absence of key non-ungulate bear foods had little weight of evidence (w(i) <= 0.01). Food-caching behaviour did not appear to be related to variation in resource availability or risk of food spoilage but was significantly influenced by prey size. Although bears chose sites that minimized detection risk, spent more time at larger carcasses and cached 75.9% of ungulates, 50% of consumption sites had other carnivore sign, which was more likely to be present at large carcasses.

The study of the stressful effects of human disturbances on animal distribution, physiology and behaviour can provide fundamental insights for wildlife conservation. Here, we assess how two declining birds, the European RollerCoracias garrulusand the European Scops OwlOtus scops,cope with alteration by human activities in farming habitats of the south of Spain. We studied nest distribution, quantified nestling physiology (corticosterone levels in plasma and feathers and body weight close to fledgling) and parental behaviour (feeding rates) of both species along a human alteration gradient. Rollers and Scops Owls used the same type of habitat and their spatial distribution was not determined by individual quality. In Rollers, nestlings raised in scrubland areas had high stress-induced corticosterone levels, possibly due to high predation risk in this habitat. In addition, Rollers and Scops Owls showed opposite relationships with farming activity and human disturbance. Nestling Rollers showed the highest corticosterone levels in feathers, weight and parental feeding rates in areas with intense farming activity. These results suggest that despite the disturbance produced by farming activities, inducing a higher stress in these areas, cultivated areas may, simultaneously, provide parents with a higher abundance of prey which would trigger increased feeding rates and, hence, higher nestling weights. Furthermore, nestling Scops Owls showed the highest stress-induced corticosterone levels in areas close to roads, suggesting that they would be affected by human disturbance due to infrastructures that disturb also at night when Scops Owls are active. Therefore, susceptibility to human disturbance may vary between species, probably due to variation in the daily pattern of human activities and the species' activity rhythm, buffering or exacerbating the effects, which should be considered in future studies on human alterations and birds.","[Exposito-Granados, Monica; Parejo, Deseada; Aviles, Jesus M.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Zool, Badajoz, Spain; [Chastel, Olivier] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Route La Canauderie, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France",,"Exposito-Granados, M (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria, Spain.",moexposit@gmail.com,"Expósito-Granados, Mónica/K-1863-2019","Expósito-Granados, Mónica/0000-0002-7996-2469","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [BES-2012-051898, EEBB-I-14-08409]","We thank Olga Corona for helping in NAbs assays at the Estacion Experimental de Zonas aridas (EEZA-CSIC).

One approach to circumvent this obstacle is to study PTSD in a valid animal model of the human syndrome. In one such model, extreme and long-lasting behavioral manifestations of anxiety develop in a subset of Lewis rats after exposure to an intense predatory threat that mimics the type of life-and-death situation known to precipitate PTSD in humans. This study aimed to assess whether the hippocampus-associated deficits observed in the human syndrome are reproduced in this rodent model. Prior to predatory threat, different groups of rats were each tested on one of three object recognition memory tasks that varied in the types of contextual clues (i.e., that require the hippocampus or not) the rats could use to identify novel items. After task completion, the rats were subjected to predatory threat and, one week later, tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM). Based on their exploratory behavior in the plus maze, rats were then classified as resilient or PTSD-like and their performance on the pre-threat object recognition tasks compared. The performance of PTSD-like rats was inferior to that of resilient rats but only when subjects relied on an allocentric frame of reference to identify novel items, a process thought to be critically dependent on the hippocampus. Therefore, these results suggest that even prior to trauma PTSD-like rats show a deficit in hippocampal-dependent functions, as reported in twin studies of human PTSD.","[Pare, Denis] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Aidekman Res Ctr, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Cascardi, Michele] Montclair State Univ, Montclair, NJ USA",,"Pare, D (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Mol & Behav Neurosci, Aidekman Res Ctr, 197 Univ Ave, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",pare@andromeda.rutgers.edu,,,NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [RO1 MH083710]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH083710] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,We thank Davine Armstrong for help with scoring of the open field behavior.

Lethal control, usually by hunting, is the most cost-effective method of reducing their number and impact. However, deer habitat use varies spatially and temporally, meaning that hunters (the predator) may search in habitats with few or no deer. Also, deer may modify their behaviour in response to hunting pressure in ways that decrease the risk of being killed, reducing the efficacy of lethal control programmes. To address these issues we decomposed the predation process into its four constituent stages-prey occurrence, predator search, predators encounter prey, predators kill prey they encounter-to reveal what makes female sika deer (Cervus nippon) in the North Island, New Zealand, more susceptible to control by professional helicopter-based hunters. Female sika deer were encountered more in some habitats or landscape features than in others, but the likelihood of kill given an encounter in those habitats was not always correspondingly high. Similarly, variables that positively influenced the probabilities of encounter and kill did not similarly influence deer occurrence, and variables most likely to be searched often poorly correlated with the other predation stages. These disparities contributed to suboptimal searching for and killing of deer by helicopter-based hunters during winter and spring, but not summer. Our study demonstrates how decomposing predation risk can identify risk and refuge areas for target species, and can be used to alter tactics as target species adjust to changing predation risk. This analytical approach is highly applicable to other human hunter-prey systems.","[Latham, A. David M.; Latham, M.

However, knowledge of how fire drives or mediates predator-prey interactions is fragmented and has not been synthesised. Here, we review and synthesise knowledge of how fire influences predator and prey behaviour and interactions. We develop a conceptual model based on predator-prey theory and empirical examples to address four key questions: (i) how and why do predators respond to fire; (ii) how and why does prey vulnerability change post-fire; (iii) what mechanisms do prey use to reduce predation risk post-fire; and (iv) what are the outcomes of predator-fire interactions for prey populations? We then discuss these findings in the context of wildlife conservation and ecosystem management before outlining priorities for future research. Fire-induced changes in vegetation structure, resource availability, and animal behaviour influence predator-prey encounter rates, the amount of time prey are vulnerable during an encounter, and the conditional probability of prey death given an encounter. How a predator responds to fire depends on fire characteristics (e.g. season, severity), their hunting behaviour (ambush or pursuit predator), movement behaviour, territoriality, and intra-guild dynamics. Prey species that rely on habitat structure for avoiding predation often experience increased predation rates and lower survival in recently burnt areas. By contrast, some prey species benefit from the opening up of habitat after fire because it makes it easier to detect predators and to modify their behaviour appropriately. Reduced prey body condition after fire can increase predation risk either through impaired ability to escape predators, or increased need to forage in risky areas due to being energetically stressed. To reduce risk of predation in the post-fire environment, prey may change their habitat use, increase sheltering behaviour, change their movement behaviour, or use camouflage through cryptic colouring and background matching. Field experiments and population viability modelling show instances where fire either amplifies or does not amplify the impacts of predators on prey populations, and vice versa. In some instances, intense and sustained post-fire predation may lead to local extinctions of prey populations. Human disruption of fire regimes is impacting faunal communities, with consequences for predator and prey behaviour and population dynamics. Key areas for future research include: capturing data continuously before, during and after fires; teasing out the relative importance of changes in visibility and shelter availability in different contexts; documenting changes in acoustic and olfactory cues for both predators and prey; addressing taxonomic and geographic biases in the literature; and predicting and testing how changes in fire-regime characteristics reshape predator-prey interactions. Understanding and managing the consequences for predator-prey communities will be critical for effective ecosystem management and species conservation in this era of global change.","[Doherty, Tim S.; Miritis, Vivianna; Dickman, Chris R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Heydon Laurence Bldg A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Geary, William L.] Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, Biodivers Strategy & Knowledge Branch, Biodivers Div, 8 Nicholson St, East Melbourne, Vic 3002, Australia; [Geary, William L.; Macdonald, Kristina J.; Watchorn, Darcy J.; Ritchie, Euan G.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood Campus,75 Pigdons Rd, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3216, Australia; [Jolly, Chris J.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr Environm & Vet Sci, Gungalman Dr, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Jolly, Chris J.] Macquarie Univ, Sch Nat Sci, G17,205B Culloden Rd, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2109, Australia; [Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, 700 Univ Blvd,MSC 218, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Conner, L.

Although several causes for declines have been implicated, the isolation of a singular cause has proven elusive. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that complex interactions between multiple environmental stressors, particularly those associated with global change, may be responsible. Increasing ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) associated with stratospheric ozone depletion is one such stressor that has received considerable attention. UV-B causes enhanced lethal effects when combined with other factors such as aquatic pH, contaminants, temperature and pathogens, but little is known of how UV-B interacts with pervasive biological stressors, such as risk of predation. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to UV-B and predatory chemical cues in a controlled laboratory experiment to determine their independent and interactive effects on survival and morphology. We show that UV-B and risk of predation interact synergistically to enhance mortality above the additive effects of the independent stressors, and that exposure to UV-B affects the ability of tadpoles to morphologically respond to predatory chemical cues (i.e. predator-induced phenotypic plasticity), which has implications for their survival in an environment with predators. This highlights the importance of considering both anthropogenic and naturally occurring stressors when examining the underlying causes of amphibian declines.","[Alton, Lesley A.; Wilson, Robbie S.; Franklin, Craig E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",,"Alton, LA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",l.alton@uq.edu.au,"Alton, Lesley A/D-6056-2014; Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012; Wilson, Robbie S/F-1463-2011","Alton, Lesley A/0000-0002-4236-2494; Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797; Wilson, Robbie/0000-0002-0116-5427",The University of Queensland Research; The University of Queensland Native and Exotic Wildlife and Marine Animals Ethics Committee [SIB/626/08/URG],"We thank Vincent van Uitregt for assistance with animal collection, Craig White for technical support, Keyne Monro for assistance with statistical analyses, and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

Avoidance of anthropogenic sounds has been measured in many species. The results, which are typically based on observations in limited exposure contexts, are frequently used to inform policy and the regulation of industrial activities. However, the occurrence and magnitude of avoidance may be a consequence of complex risk-balancing decisions made by animals. The importance of the factors in decision-making, such as perceived risks associated with the sounds or prey quantity and quality during sound exposure, is unknown. 2. Here we address this knowledge gap by measuring the relative influence of perceived -risk of a sound (silence, pile driving, and a tidal turbine) and prey patch quality on decision-making and foraging success in grey seals Halichoerus grypus. 3. Seals were given access to two underwater 'prey patches' in an experimental pool where fish were delivered at controlled rates to simulate a low-density (LD) and a high-density (HD) prey patch. Acoustic playbacks were made using an underwater speaker above one of the prey patches (randomised during the study), and three decision and foraging metrics (foraging duration, foraging effort allocation between the prey patches, and foraging success) were measured. 4. Foraging success was highest during silent controls and was similar regardless of speaker location (LD/HD). Under the tidal turbine and pile-driving treatments, foraging success was similar to the controls when the speaker was located at the HD prey patch but was significantly reduced (similar to 16%-28% lower) when the speaker was located at the LD prey patch. Foraging decisions by the seals were consistent with a risk/profit balancing approach. Avoidance rates depend on the quality of the prey patch as well as the perceived risk. 5. Policy implications. The results suggest that foraging context is important when interpreting avoidance behaviour and should be considered when predicting the effects of anthropogenic activities. For example, sound exposure in different prey patch qualities may result in markedly different avoidance behaviour, potentially leading to contrasting predictions of impact in Environmental Assessments. We recommend future studies explicitly consider foraging context, and other contextual factors such as behavioural state (e.g. foraging or travelling) and habitat quality.","[Hastie, Gordon D.; McKnight, J.

As such, the quantitative results from such studies may often underestimate the lethality of certain toxic compounds. A well-known example of this concept is illustrated by the marked increase in the lethality of pesticides when larval amphibians are concurrently exposed to the odor of potential predators. Here, we investigated the interaction between background levels of environmental predation risk (high vs. low) and ocean acidification (ambient vs. elevated CO2) in 2 x 2 design. Wild-caught juvenile damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, were exposed in the laboratory to the different risk and CO2 conditions for 4 days and released onto coral reef patches. Using a well-established field assay, we monitored the in situ behavior and mortality of the damselfish for 2 days. We predicted that juvenile fish exposed to elevated CO2 and high-risk conditions would display more severe behavioral impairments and increased mortality compared to fish exposed to elevated CO2 maintained under low-risk conditions. As expected, elevated CO2 exposure led to impaired antipredator responses and increased mortality in low-risk fish compared to ambient CO2 controls. However, we failed to find an effect of elevated CO2 on the behavior and survival of the high-risk fish. We hypothesized that the results may stem from either a behavioral compensation or a physiological response to high risk. Our results provide insights into the interactive nature of environmental and natural stressors and advance our understanding of the predicted effect of ocean acidification on aquatic ecosystems.","[Ferrari, Maud C.

In the spring and summer, we observed alert responses (including stare, walking away, and flee) of deer and recorded the intensity of tourist disturbance in a small display pen using a laser-range finder to measure the alert distance of a free-ranging group in a large enclosure. We also recorded the pattern of head orientation when deer were resting in these two deer groups. After statistical analysis, we found that: 1) in small pen, the frequency of alert response was significantly different among different intensities of human disturbance; strong disturbance resulted in higher frequency of alert response; 2) stare distance in the free-ranging group in summer was significantly longer than that in spring, but the distance of walking away and the distance of flee showed no significant difference between the two seasons; and 3) in free-ranging group, there was no significant directional difference in head orientation, whereas in display group, there was a significant directional difference in head orientation. We suggest that: 1) under the captive situation, human disturbance may be one of the factors that affect alert response in Pere David's deer; and 2) Pere David's deer adopted different alert response to adapt to human disturbance under different circumstance. We recommended that relationships between alert response and human disturbance should be considered in ex situ conservation of this field extinct deer. Zoo Biol 26:461-470, 2007. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss.

Four hypotheses were proposed and tested; that habitats are used on the basis of (1) availability, (2) foraging rewards (following the ideal free distribution), (3) foraging rewards modified by the constraints of nocturnal predation risk (partial trade-off) or (4) foraging rewards modified by the constraints of continuous predation risk (full trade-off). Food availability in each habitat was quantified through quadrat surveys describing stem density, plant part availability and nutrient availability (protein and energy) of key plant foods per unit area. Predation risk in each habitat was evaluated using measures describing the relative threat of attack and capture by both leopards, Panthera pardus, and lions, Panthera lee; attack risk was determined on the basis of habitat visibility and predator ambush distances, while capture risk was calculated using a simple model incorporating predator and prey velocities, habitat visibility and nearest refuge distance. Patterns of baboon behaviour were assessed for adult males and females in four groups through day-follows and instantaneous sampling. The baboons did not use habitats directly in proportion to their availability in the group's ranging area (in contrast to hypothesis 1). Nor did patterns of habitat use match those expected on the basis of the ideal free distribution, either during all activities (hypothesis 2) or during feeding (hypothesis 3). Instead, the baboons spent less time feeding in the high-risk food-rich habitat but more time feeding in the low-risk relatively food-poor habitat. Baboons also preferred low-risk habitats in other activities, where during resting and grooming all habitats were avoided except the safest (where key food species were absent). These results support hypothesis 4. Deviations from these patterns by a unimale group indicate that male reproductive strategies may also play a role in habitat selection.

While predator facilitation is well established in natural predator-prey systems, little attention has been paid to situations where human hunters compete with natural predators for the same prey. Here, we investigate hunting-mediated predator facilitation in a hunter-predator-prey system. We found that hunter avoidance by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) exposed them to increase predation risk by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). Lynx responded by increasing their activity and predation on deer, providing evidence that superadditive hunting mortality may be occurring through predator facilitation. Our results reveal a new pathway through which human hunters, in their role as top predators, may affect species interactions at lower trophic levels and thus drive ecosystem processes.","[Gehr, Benedikt; Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gehr, Benedikt; Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Zool Museum, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hofer, Elizabeth J.; Ryser, Andreas; Vimercati, Eric; Vogt, Kristina] KORA, Carnivore Ecol & Wildlife Management, Muri, Switzerland; [Pewsner, Mirjam] Fed Off Environm, Forest & Wildlife Biodivers Sect, Ittigen, Switzerland",,"Gehr, B (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",benedikt.gehr@ieu.uzh.ch,,"Gehr, Benedikt/0000-0002-1044-9296; Lukas, Keller/0000-0002-0149-0174",Swiss Federal Office for the Environment; University of Zurich,Swiss Federal Office for the Environment and the University of Zurich,,51,10,10,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

This variability has been correlated to contrasting habitats surrounding these caves and the presence of carnivores, suggesting that ecological factors may have influenced tool manufacturing in the Early Pleistocene. However, the strength of behavioral ecological interpretations rests upon the identification of adaptive advantages in employing specific reduction strategies. Knapping experiments are used to compare the flaking efficiency of bipolar and freehand reduction, which measures the rate at which these methods convert core mass into cutting edge length. Results suggest that bipolar knapping is an efficient means of producing useable flakes, and its use at Swartkrans potentially reflects adaptations to limiting predation risks.","[Caruana, Matthew, V] Univ Johannesburg, Palaeores Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa",,"Caruana, MV (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Palaeores Inst, POB 524, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa.",mattc@uj.ac.za,"Caruana, Matthew/AAB-7528-2022","Caruana, Matthew/0000-0002-2095-5360",African Origins Platform of the National Research Foundation [98815]; University of Johannesburg's Research Committee,"I dedicate this work to my daughter, Riley Caruana.

Human hunters act as top predators to influence the behaviour of free-ranging mammals, including large carnivorous species such as black bears (Ursus americanus). Analysing the effects of hunting on animal behavioural patterns is essential for understanding the extent to which animals detect and respond to human-induced disturbances. To this end, we assessed whether black bear movement behaviour changed with varying risk from spatially and temporally heterogeneous human predation. Levels of risk were categorized as either low (disturbance from dog training; n = 19 bears) or high (disturbance from hunting activities; n = 11 bears). Road types were either paved (risk due to vehicles) or non-paved (risk due to hunters) and were used as proxies for hunting effort and amount of disturbance. We began by testing the null hypothesis that bears' distribution before the onset of human disturbance is spatially random. Next, to test temporal movement adjustment between the low and high risk levels, we measured the distance to the nearest road and the road crossing frequency using mixed effects models with risk level, time of day and sex as predictor variables. As disturbance near non-paved roads increased due to the start of the hunting activity, the mean distances of bears to non-paved roads increased while the mean distances of bears to paved roads decreased, despite the continual risk of vehicle collision. These behavioural responses were observed during day and night, with the frequency of crossing paved roads at night five times greater than in daytime during the hunting season. Our findings demonstrate that black bears are able to detect risky places and adjust their spatial movements accordingly. More specifically, bears can perceive changes in the level of risk from human hunting activities on a fine temporal scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) allows higher throughput and ease in studying human brain disorders. Objectives This study investigated in zebrafish the effect of non-mammalian homologs isotocin (IT) and vasotocin (AVT) in comparison with OT/AVP on social behavior and fear response to predator. The mechanism was studied using the most human selective OT and AVP receptor antagonists. Methods Zebrafish were injected i.m. with increasing doses (0.001-40 ng/kg) of the neuropeptides. DesGly-NH2-d(CH2)(5)-[d-Tyr(2),Thr(4)]OVT) for OT receptor, SR 49059 for V1a subtype receptor, and SSR-149415 for V1b subtype receptor were injected i.m. 10 min before each agonist. Results All the peptides increased social preference and reduced fear to predator response in a dose-dependent manner interpolated by symmetrical parabolas. AVT/AVP were more potent to elicit anxiolytic than social effect while IT and OT were equally potent. All the antagonists dose-dependently inhibited both the effects induced by the neuropeptides. The ratio between the ED50 obtained for blocking the OT-induced effects on social preference and fear response to predator was very high only for desglyDTTyrOVT (160). SR49059 showed the highest ratio in blocking AVP-induced effects (807). The less selective antagonist appeared to be SSR149415. Conclusions For the first time, IT/AVT and OT/AVP were found to modulate in zebrafish, social behavior, unrelated to sex, and fear to predator response through at least two different receptors. Zebrafish is confirmed as a valid, reliable model to study deficit in social behavior characteristic of some psychiatric disorders.","[Busnelli, Marta; Chini, Bice; Sala, Mariaelvina] CNR, Inst Neurosci, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Braida, Daniela; Donzelli, Andrea; Martucci, Roberta; Capurro, Valeria; Busnelli, Marta; Sala, Mariaelvina] Univ Milan, Dept Pharmacol Chemotherapy & Med Toxicol, Milan, Italy",,"Sala, M (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Neurosci, Via Vanvitelli 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",mariaelvina.sala@unimi.it,"Sala, Mariaelvina/AAF-6469-2019; Busnelli, Marta/AAR-5513-2021","Busnelli, Marta/0000-0003-3387-2190; sala, mariaelvina/0000-0001-9310-958X; Chini, Bice/0000-0002-1686-284X",CARIPLO FoundationFondazione Cariplo [2008 N. 2314],"This work was supported by the CARIPLO Foundation Grant 2008 N. 2314.

However, conflicts between invasive species managers and local people occur, when the target species is strongly bonded with humans. To understand the attitudes and behaviors of local people toward the issues on free-roaming cats (Felis silvestris catus), we conducted a questionnaire study covering all high school students-who are important future stakeholders and could reflect ideas of their parents whose responses are hard to attain-on Tokunoshima Island, Japan, where the ecological negative impacts of free-roaming cats are exacerbated by residents' feeding. We used a cognitive hierarchy model and structural equation modeling (SEM) to study the relations between our questionnaire items: background characteristics (i.e., cat ownership, education experience around cat-caused negative ecological impacts, attitudes and perceptions around cats and nature), perceptions of the negative cat impacts on nature and people, attitudes toward outdoor cat management, and the frequency of outdoor feeding. Results from 1162 youth respondents showed that cat owners and people who believed that cats are useful for rodent control exhibited a higher frequency of outdoor feeding, perhaps due to feeding their own cats outdoors. Perceptions on the negative impacts of cats on people (e.g., zoonoses and public nuisances) which were disagreed by cat lovers, showed a stronger effect than the perceptions of negative ecological impacts, in terms of the approval of outdoor cat management. In general, informing people about the threats of outdoor cats to people, house-owned cats and livestock through education activities regarding the cat issues will lead to a better understanding and cooperation toward outdoor cat management. Educating teenagers who are more likely to accept new knowledge is especially necessary. Keeping cats indoors and reducing the frequency of feeding outdoor cats are still one of the fundamental solutions to decrease the number of outdoor cats, which will in turn decrease the risk of cat predation on native species.","[Qi, Huiyuan] Univ Tokyo, Fac Agr, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Qi, Huiyuan] Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, 2-24 Tanaka Sekiden Cho, Kyoto 6068203, Japan; [Watari, Yuya] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Matsunosato 1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Miyashita, Tadashi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan",,"Qi, HY (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Fac Agr, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.; Qi, HY (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, 2-24 Tanaka Sekiden Cho, Kyoto 6068203, Japan.",qi.huiyuan.85z@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20184004],This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF20184004) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan.,,90,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2351-9894,,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

Place learning through direct exposure to threat puts the individual at a risk that may be avoided, however, by remembering the location in which encounters between conspecifics and dangerous events are observed. Despite much theoretical work predicting that individuals should rely less on private information and more on public information as the risk of individual assessment increases, there have been no tests of observational spatial memory for potentially dangerous places. We investigated whether Indian mynahs learn about an area in which they observe another individual experience an aversive event, namely capture by a human. Experimental observers watched a human chase, catch and remove a conspecfic from a feeding site in which observers were accustomed to feeding. A control group watched a human perform the same capture gestures, but with no mynah present. Analysis of observer behaviour at the feeding site both before and after observational training revealed that experimental observers locomoted more after training than before, relative to control observers, suggesting that mynahs acquired a fear response after watching a predatory attack on a conspecific. It appears that, in addition to learning about the location in which aversive events are experienced directly, animals learn about an environment in which they observe others encounter dangerous events.

Human disturbance may trigger similar trade-offs in birds that the natural risk of predation generates on productivity through parental investment decisions. To estimate how the impact of human presence affects breeding birds on Mediterranean beaches, the behaviour of incubating Kentish PloversCharadrius alexandrinuswas studied in relation to the approach of people, vehicles and dogs. Observational data were collected and control experiments were performed with a standardized stimulus. The response variability of birds in the decision to flush from the nest was studied depending on the type of beach user, the location of the disturbance event and thermal stress. Walkers, when accompanied by dogs, flushed plovers 93.8% of the time when walking through dunes and 80.0% of the time when walking on paths, whereas pedestrians alone flushed plovers 47.6% of the time when in dunes and only 12.9% of the time when on paths. Lone dogs triggered a flushing response 100% of the time when they roamed the dunes and 50% on the shore. The number of users in each disturbance event did not affect the flushing behaviour. Nest return times were shorter on disturbed beaches, suggesting habituation to the human disturbance stimulus. The ambient temperature for the nests in which plovers flushed was lower and nest return time decreased proportionally with ambient temperature, both suggesting that habituation to the human disturbance stimulus encourages relaxation of the trade-off between escape behaviour to avoid predation risk and the effects of thermal stress on unattended eggs. Females flushed more frequently (57.1%) than males (32.0%), suggesting that they may perceive risk differently. Establishing buffers between nesting areas and people may help birds habituate to the predictable and non-lethal stimulus of human presence, facilitating coexistence between conservation and recreation.","[Gomez-Serrano, Miguel angel] Univ Valencia, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Microbiol & Ecol, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; [Gomez-Serrano, Miguel angel] VAERSA Generalitat Valenciana, Avda Cortes Valencianas 20, Valencia 46015, Spain",,"Gomez-Serrano, MA (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Microbiol & Ecol, E-46100 Valencia, Spain.; Gomez-Serrano, MA (corresponding author), VAERSA Generalitat Valenciana, Avda Cortes Valencianas 20, Valencia 46015, Spain.",miguel.gomez@uv.es,,,"Conselleria de Infraestructuras, Territorio y Medio Ambiente (Generalitat Valenciana)Generalitat Valenciana","I thank P.

Previous work has established that O. triseriatus adopts low-risk behaviors in the presence of predation risk from T rutilus. It is unknown whether introduced A. albopictus show a similar response to this predator. Behavior of fourth instars of A. albopictus or O. triseriatus was recorded in water that had held either A. albopictus or O. triseriatus larvae alone (control) and in water that had held T rutilus larvae feeding on either A. albopictus or O. triseriatus (predation). Activity and position of larvae were recorded in 30-min instantaneous scan censuses. In response to water-borne cues to predation, O. triseriatus adopted low-risk behaviors (more resting, less feeding and movement), but A. albopictus did not change its behavior. We also tested the species specificity of the cues by recording the behavior of A. albopictus in water prepared using O. triseriatus and vice versa. O. trisetiatus adopted low-risk behaviors even in predation water prepared by feeding T rutilus with A. albopictus, but A. albopictus did not alter its behavior significantly between predation and control treatments prepared using O. triseriatus. Thus, A. albopictus does not seem to respond behaviorally to cues produced by this predator and may be more vulnerable to predation than is O. triseriatus.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci Behav Ecol Evolut, Normal, IL 61790 USA; Illinois State Univ, Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA",,"Kesavaraju, B (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci Behav Ecol Evolut, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793, R01 AI044793-01] Funding Source: Medline",,,26,79,80,2,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0013-8746,1938-2901,,ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM,Ann.

Monitoring threat is an adaptive process and is of considerable relevance to humans. It is therefore important to understand how the presence of others influences threat monitoring - namely vigilance - and consequently the capacity to detect threats. We examine this with a novel paradigm, that simulates a foraging under threat situation, with an eye-tracker (allowing the examination of the allocation of attention). Our results show, as predicted, that participants in the individual condition (versus co-presence) allocated more attentional resources to scanning the environment and thereby sacrificing foraging, which increased their likelihood of detecting threatening events. Thus, the presence or absence of others modulates vigilance strategies in humans. These findings highlight the heuristic value of animal vigilance models to understand humans threat monitoring with considerable applied relevance.","[Gomes, Nuno; Semin, Gun R.] ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Gab 132,Rua Jardim Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Semin, Gun R.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Semin, GR (corresponding author), ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Gab 132,Rua Jardim Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal.",gun.r.semin@gmail.com,"Semin, Gun/J-4046-2013","Semin, Gun/0000-0002-5304-5566; Gomes, Nuno/0000-0002-0545-607X","Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/116653/2016, IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001]",Both authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (grant ref.: SFRH/BD/116653/2016 to NG; grant ref.: IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001 to GRS).,,36,4,5,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1090-5138,1879-0607,,EVOL HUM BEHAV,Evol.

Shark-feeding has become the most developed provisioning activity around the world, despite its controversial nature. Amongst other detrimental effects, the long-term aggregation of sharks can modify the natural behaviour of the animals, potentially increase their aggression toward humans, and favour inbreeding. During 949 diving surveys conducted over 44 mo, we investigated the ecology and residence patterns of 36 photo-identified adult sicklefin lemon sharks Negaprion acutidens.

From this long-term survey, we identified 5 different behavioural groups that we described as new sharks' (7), 'missing sharks' (4), 'resident sharks' (13), 'unpredictable sharks' (5) and 'ghost sharks' (7). In spite of movements in and out of the area by some males and females, which were probably related to mating, the general trend was that residency significantly increased during the study, particularly in males, showing a risk of inbreeding due to the reduction of shark mobility. Intra- and interspecific aggression was also witnessed, leading to an increased risk of potentially severe bites to humans.

Anthropogenic disturbance, especially urbanization, changes a range of environmental factors including habitat characteristics and predation risk. As a consequence of differences in microhabitat structure and repeated exposure to anthropogenic disturbance, we hypothesize that animals in urban environments will be less risk averse than those in rural environments. Here, we examined the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic factors to understand the escape strategies of Psammophilus dorsalis across an urban-rural gradient. First, urban lizards used lower perches and chose refuges that were closer to their perches compared to rural lizards. Flight initiation distance (FID) of urban lizards in the field was shorter than that of rural lizards, but only for males. In response to a second attack, only rural males decreased their FIDs, whereas urban males showed low and invariable FIDs. Laboratory measures of sprint performance showed expected differences between the sexes, but no significant difference between urban and rural populations. Unlike the strong differences between males across habitats, escape strategies of females were similar in urban and rural areas, most likely because females generally rely on crypsis to minimize predation risk and are resistant to flee when approached. In sum, urban lizards have access to a more complex structural environment, with greater perch and refuge options, and have habituated to non-lethal anthropogenic disturbance. These extrinsic and intrinsic factors combine to result in lower risk aversion and may explain the ability to tolerate urban environments. Significance statement Rapid urbanization is at its peak globally, and many animals are forced to adjust to the associated environmental changes or face local extinction. Some species, however, seem to persist in urban areas, and we hypothesize that they behaviorally respond by being less risk averse. We used a multivariate approach to understand the escape strategies of the peninsula rock agama across an urban-rural gradient. Lizards in urban areas use a more complex structural environment, with greater perch and refuge options, compared to rural lizards. Urban lizards also allow closer approaches. Because of the differences in body coloration and size, escape strategies of females were less affected by urbanization as they use crypsis to minimize predation risk. All these extrinsic and intrinsic factors combine to result in lower risk aversion by urban lizards and may explain their tolerance of human altered environments.","[Batabyal, Anuradha; Thaker, Maria] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Balakrishna, Shashank] St Josephs Coll, Dept Zool, 36 Langford Rd, Bangalore 560027, Karnataka, India; [Balakrishna, Shashank] Vrije Univ Brussel, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",,"Thaker, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",mthaker@ces.iisc.ernet.in,"Batabyal, Anuradha/M-4264-2019","Balakrishna, Shashank/0000-0002-5890-6847; Batabyal, Anuradha/0000-0002-3373-5519","DBT-IISc partnership program; Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change; University Grants CommissionUniversity Grants Commission, India","The work was supported by the DBT-IISc partnership program and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.

Fear's evolved function is motivating survival via defensive behaviours. Defensive behaviours have been highly conserved throughout mammalian species; hence much may be learned from ethology. Predation pressure drove the early evolution of defences, laying foundations in the more ancient brain structures. Conspecific (same species) pressure has been a more recent evolutionary influence, but along with environmental threats it has dominated PTSD research. Anti-predator responses involve both avoiding a predator's sensory field and avoiding detection if within it, as well as escape behaviours. More effective avoidance results in less need for escape behaviours, suggesting that avoidance is biologically distinct from flight. Recognizing the predation, environmental and conspecific origins of defence may result in clearer definition of PTSD phenomena. Defence can also be viewed in the stages of no threat, potential threat, encounter and circa strike. Specific defences are used sequentially and according to contexts, loosely in the order: avoidance, attentive immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defence, appeasement and tonic immobility. The DSM-IV criteria and PTSD research show substantial congruence with the model proposed: that PTSD is a disorder of heightened defence involving six key defences used in conjunction with vigilance and risk assessment according to contexts. Human research is reviewed in this respect with reference to laboratory and wild animal observations providing new insights. Understanding individual perceptual issues (e. g. predictability and controllability) relevant to these phenomena, combined with defence strategy recalibration and neuronal plasticity research goes some way to explaining why some traumatized individuals develop PTSD when others do not.","Univ Queensland, Dept Psychiat, Noosa Heads, Qld 4567, Australia",,"Cantor, C (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Psychiat, POB 1216, Noosa Heads, Qld 4567, Australia.",cantor98@powerup.com.au,,,,,,74,38,38,0,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0004-8674,1440-1614,,AUST NZ J PSYCHIAT,Aust.

Numerous species require immediate conservation intervention. But our ability to identify species on the brink of decline, and to intervene successfully, depends on developing reliable leading indicators of population, community, and environmental change. Classic approaches, such as population and life history assessment, as well as indicator species, trail environmental change. Adaptive behaviors honed by natural selection to respond quickly to environmental changes represent true leading indicators that we can learn to apply to conservation and management. Excellent examples of useful behaviors for conservation include foraging behavior, patch use, and habitat selection. Comparisons among giving-up densities collected in artificial resource patches can effectively indicate the forager's predation costs, its habitat quality, mechanisms of coexistence, and environmental richness. Patterns of adaptive habitat use can similarly reveal the relative value of different types of habitat, the location, and amounts of source versus sink habitat in a landscape, the effects of human disturbance, and projections on future extinction risk. Each behavior is likely to change more quickly than population size. As useful as these and related indicators may be to managers and conservationists, similar behaviors can emerge from different causes, and immediate returns of behavior to fitness may cause rapid evolution of associated morphological and physiological traits. Conservation strategies will thereby often be most. effective if they build on research programs targeting the processes influencing adaptive behaviors and that assess whether wild-type or novel behaviors are most likely to sustain populations into the future.","[Morris, Douglas W.; Ale, Som B.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Israel Dept Desert Ecol, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Sundararaj, Vijayan] Lakehead Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Environm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada",,"Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada's Department of Indian and Northern Affairs,"We thank Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and Canada's Department of Indian and Northern Affairs (Arctic WOLVES, IPY) for their continuing support of DWM's and SBA's research in evolutionary ecology",,123,41,45,1,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0077-8923,,978-1-57331-753-5,ANN NY ACAD SCI,Ann.NY Acad.Sci.,,2009,1162,,,,,,334,356,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04494.x,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,BJI87,WOS:000266235600014,19432655,,,,2022-04-19,

However, the presence and activities of people in high mountains have been growing rapidly and have led to the advent of human-induced factors, which may modify the time budget. In this study, we examined the influence of natural and human-induced factors on the daytime budget of Tatra chamois Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica. On average, chamois spent 46% of their time foraging, 40% resting, 13% moving around and 1% on social behaviour. The amount of time devoted to particular categories of behaviour was influenced by the time of day, herd size, weather conditions and human disturbance. Human disturbance and the time of day had the highest effect on the proportion of foraging in the daytime budget, which increased as the day progressed and at greater distances from the nearest hiking trail. These two factors also increased the amount of time spent resting, which peaked during the afternoon hours and at greater distances from the nearest trail. The time spent moving around decreased with increasing herd size, distance from the nearest trail and as the day progressed. Males devoted less time to foraging and more to resting and moving around than females. The intensity of human-induced factors is particularly important for a population inhabiting a small, isolated area, as is the case with strictly high-mountain species.","[Peksa, Lukasz] Tatra Natl Pk,Ul Kuznice 1, PL-34500 Zakopane, Poland; [Ciach, Michal] Univ Agr, Fac Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Dept Forest Biodivers, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland",,"Ciach, M (corresponding author), Univ Agr, Fac Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Dept Forest Biodivers, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland.",michal.ciach@ur.krakow.pl,"Ciach, Michal/I-4377-2016","Ciach, Michal/0000-0002-5619-9747",,,,74,8,10,2,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2199-2401,2199-241X,,MAMMAL RES,Mammal Res.,OCT,2018,63,4,,,,,443,453,,10.1007/s13364-018-0376-y,,,11,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,GT7XK,WOS:000444745100006,,hybrid,,,2022-04-19,

According to numerous data the genotype plays a significant role in the expression of aggressive behavior. However, it remains unclear how genetic predisposition to one kind of aggression is linked with other kinds of aggressive behavior, especially pathological aggression (infanticide). Here, we report on our investigation of the expression of defensive, offensive, predatory and asocial aggression in wild rats selectively bred for 85 generations for either a high level or a lack of aggression towards humans. We found that those rats genetically predisposed to a high level of defensive aggression showed decreased social behavior and increased pathological aggressive behavior towards juvenile males. The highly aggressive rates showed a reduced latency time of attack and an increased latency time of the first social contact. Rats genetically predisposed to defensive aggression demonstrated increased predatory aggression-latency time of muricide was shorter in highly aggressive than in tame animals. At the same time, both lines of rats did not differ significantly in intermale aggression. We conclude that the data indicate a close relation between defensive, predatory and pathological aggressive behavior that allows us to suggest that similar genetic mechanisms underlie these types of aggressive behavior.","[Ilchibaeva, Tatiana V.; Tsybko, Anton S.; Popova, Nina K.; Naumenko, Vladimir S.] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Div, Dept Behav Neurogen, Fed Res Ctr,Inst Cytol & Genet, Lavrentieva Av 10, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Kozhemyakina, Rimma V.; Konoshenko, Maria Y.] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Div, Lab Evolutionary Genet, Fed Res Ctr,Inst Cytol & Genet, Novosibirsk, Russia",,"Ilchibaeva, TV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Div, Dept Behav Neurogen, Fed Res Ctr,Inst Cytol & Genet, Lavrentieva Av 10, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",rbicehok@mail.ru,"Ilchibaeva, Tatiana/AAE-1228-2021; Tsybko, Anton/AAN-8043-2020; Kozhemyakina, Rimma/AAO-3296-2020; Konoshenko, Maria/AAH-9257-2019; Naumenko, Vladimir/R-3096-2018; Ilchibaeva, Tatiana/AAN-8072-2020",,Russian Scientific FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-25-00038],The study was supported by the Russian Scientific Foundation Grant No. 14-25-00038.,,34,4,4,0,25,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0289-0771,1439-5444,,J ETHOL,J.

However, it is unknown if a single circuit controls escape vigor from innate and conditioned threats. Cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing cells in the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) are necessary for initiating escape from innate threats via a projection to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We now show that in mice PMd-cck cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Intriguingly, PMd-cck and dlPAG activity in mice showed higher mutual information during exposure to innate and conditioned threats. In parallel, human functional magnetic resonance imaging data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increased activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd-dlPAG circuit as a central node, controlling escape vigor elicited by both innate and conditioned threats.","[Wang, Weisheng; Schuette, Peter J.; La-Vu, Mimi Q.; Tobias, Brooke C.; Reis, Fernando M.

The present study validates a rodent model of BI based on an ethologically relevant predator exposure paradigm. We show that individual differences in rat BI are stable and trait-like from adolescence into adulthood. Using in situ hybridization to quantify expression of the immediate early genes homer1a and fos as measures of neuronal activation, we show that individual differences in BI are correlated with the activation of various stress-responsive brain regions that include the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and CA3 region of the hippocampus. Further supporting the concept that threat-induced BI in rodents reflects levels of anxiety, we also show that BI is decreased by administration of the anxiolytic, diazepam. Finally, we developed criteria for identifying extreme BI animals that are stable in their expression of high levels of BI and also show that high BI (HBI) individuals exhibit maladaptive appetitive responses following stress exposure. These findings support the use of predator threat as a stimulus and HBI rats as a model to study mechanisms underlying extreme and stable BI in humans.","[Roseboom, P. H.; Nanda, S. A.; Speers, J.

These changes might in turn alter the circadian system due to co-evolutionary mechanisms or correlated selection responses both at behavioural and molecular levels, with knock-on effects on daily physiological processes and behavioural outputs. We examined the evolutionary impact of size-selective mortality on group risk-taking behaviour and the circadian system in a model fish species. We exposed zebrafish Danio rerio to either large or small size-selective harvesting relative to a control over five generations, followed by eight generations during which harvesting was halted to remove maternal effects. Size-selective mortality affected fine-scale timing of behaviours. In particular, small size-selective mortality, typical of specialized fisheries and gape-limited predators targeting smaller size classes, increased group risk-taking behaviuor during feeding and after simulated predator attacks. Moreover, small size-selective mortality increased early peaks of daily activity as well as extended self-feeding daily activity to the photophase compared to controls. By contrast large size-selective mortality, typical of most wild capture fisheries, only showed an almost significant effect of decreasing group risk-taking behaviour during the habituation phase and no clear changes in fine-scale timing of daily behavioural rhythms compared to controls. We also found changes in the molecular circadian core clockwork in response to both size-selective mortality treatments. These changes disappeared in the clock output pathway because both size-selected lines showed similar transcription profiles. This switch downstream to the molecular circadian core clockwork also resulted in similar overall behavioural rhythms (diurnal swimming and self-feeding in the last hours of darkness) independent of the underlying molecular clock. To conclude, our experimental harvest left an asymmetrical evolutionary legacy in group risk-taking behaviour and in fine-scale daily behavioural rhythms. Yet, the overall timing of activity showed evolutionary resistance probably maintained by a molecular switch. Our experimental findings suggest that size-selective mortality can have consequences for behaviour and physiological processes.","[Sbragaglia, Valerio; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany; [Sbragaglia, Valerio] Inst Marine Sci ICM CSIC, Dept Marine Renewable Resources, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Olmeda, Jose Fernando] Univ Murcia, Dept Physiol, Fac Biol, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia, Spain; [Frigato, Elena; Bertolucci, Cristiano] Univ Ferrara, Dept Life Sci & Biotechnol, Ferrara, Italy; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Div Integrat Fisheries & Management, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Berlin, Germany",,"Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany.; Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Inst Marine Sci ICM CSIC, Dept Marine Renewable Resources, Barcelona, Spain.",valeriosbra@gmail.com,"Bertolucci, Cristiano/Q-5804-2019; Lopez-Olmeda, Jose Fernando/K-3848-2014; sbragaglia, valerio/K-7592-2014","Bertolucci, Cristiano/0000-0003-0252-3107; Lopez-Olmeda, Jose Fernando/0000-0003-4920-5704; sbragaglia, valerio/0000-0002-4775-7049; Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X",Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [RTI2018-100678-A-I00]; Deutscher Akademischer AustauschdienstDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [91632699],"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: IJC2018-035389-I and RYC-2016-20959; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Grant/Award Number: 91632699; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: RTI2018-100678-A-I00",,98,3,3,5,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Still, our understanding of animal emotions is limited. In this review we focus on the potential of cerebral-lateralization research to provide new insights into animal emotional processing. Thereby, our aims were, first, to find a universal lateralization pattern in emotional processing across vertebrates and, second, to discuss how knowledge of emotional-lateralization patterns can be used in science and practice to contribute to improve farm-animal welfare. A literature review suggests evidence of lateralized functioning during emotional contexts across the vertebrate classes, from early vertebrates such as fish and amphibians to non-human primates. With the possible exception of fish, all vertebrate classes seem to show a similar lateralization pattern for emotional processing, with a right-hemisphere dominance for processing rather negatively connotated emotions, such as fear and aggression, and a left-hemisphere dominance for processing positively connotated emotions, such as those elicited by a food reward. Thus, both hemispheres are involved in emotional processing and hemispheric dominance may be used as an indicator of emotional valence (negative-positive). Although only a few domestic animal species (e.g. chicken, sheep, dog and horse) have been extensively studied with regard to emotional lateralization, evidence gathered so far suggests that the right-hemisphere dominance for fear and aggression and left-hemisphere dominance in responses to food rewards also applies to these species. Such patterns could be exploited in animal welfare studies to gain insight into how an animal experiences a potentially emotional situation and to improve farm-animal management. Further research should focus on rarely-studied species and on rarely-studied emotional contexts, such as sex and positive social situations, to improve our understanding of animal emotional lateralization.

Male grouping patterns are thought to be driven more by spatial and temporal dispersion of mating opportunities than by food resources or predation risk. We evaluated the influence of 3 factors on male group sizes and number of males in mixed-sex groups in African elephants; forage availability (using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a satellite-based indicator of primary productivity), anthropogenic mortality risk (using distance of elephants from a protected area center), and mating opportunities (using the number of males in mixed-sex groups with and without estrous females). Using zero-truncated negative binomial regressions and a model-selection approach, we found that male elephants occurred in larger groups where primary productivity was higher and where they were further from a protected area center. However, we found an interaction between primary productivity and anthropogenic mortality risk: at low primary productivity, elephants formed larger groups further away from a protected area center, but did less so at higher primary productivity. This pattern suggests that male elephants are sensitive to seasonal variation in potential anthropogenic mortality risk, by remaining in smaller groups when risk is low, but forming larger groups when risk is high. Mating opportunities also led to an increase in male numbers in mixed-sex groups, but its relative influence on male grouping was less important because mating opportunities were rare.Male African elephants occur in larger groups when food or mating opportunities are abundant, or when they were far from protected areas. However, at the greatest distances from protected area boundaries, often in croplands, males occur in large groups when food is scarce, perhaps because risk from humans is highest at this time. Risk of human-induced mortality and food abundance has a more important influence on elephant group size than mating opportunities, which are rare.","[Chiyo, Patrick I.; Alberts, Susan C.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Chiyo, Patrick I.; Archie, Elizabeth A.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Wilson, John W.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lee, Phyllis C.] Univ Stirling, Sch Nat Sci, Behav & Evolut Res Grp, Dept Psychol, Stirling FK12 5ND, Scotland; [Lee, Phyllis C.; Moss, Cynthia J.] Amboseli Trust Elephants, Nairobi 00509, Kenya",,"Chiyo, PI (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",pchiyo@gmail.com,"Wilson, John W./E-9601-2011; Archie, Elizabeth/AAE-7456-2022","Wilson, John W./0000-0002-7230-1449; Lee, Phyllis/0000-0002-4296-3513","US Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service [AFE-0314/6-G085]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IBN0091612]; Amboseli Trust for Elephants; Moreau Fellowship at the University of Notre Dame; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX11AP61G, NNX11AL49H]","This research was funded by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (AFE-0314/6-G085), the National Science Foundation (IBN0091612 to S.

Prey age at death reflects hunting decisions and opportunities in terms of calories returned for energy spent and risks taken. Nonhuman carnivores commonly harvest vulnerable individuals (young and old), whereas humans consistently can take prime adults. As an example of how mortality profiles can be used to illuminate predator behavior, this article examines when the ability to select prime-age animals emerged during human behavioral evolution. Although it would be expected that the appearance of this behavior coincided with the appearance of morphologically and archaeologically modern humans, analyses of archaeological assemblages from western Europe and South Africa suggest that this trait was already present in archaic people who preceded modern humans. Studying age distributions in fossil assemblages is not without its limitations, including the difficulty of estimating age at death in fossil specimens, pre- and postdepositional biases, and reconstructing the age structure and behavior of prey herds. Nevertheless, valuable behavioral information can be gained by using controlled comparisons of many assemblages.","Stanford Univ, Dept Anthropol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Steele, TE (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Anthropol Sci, 450 Serra Mall,Bldg 360, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tsteele@stanford.edu,,"Steele, Teresa/0000-0002-3091-6488",,,,99,42,45,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

Hen Sichuan Partridges led the chicks back to the nests where they hatched in the evening and roosted there over night. This behavior lasted 6.7 +/- 4.3 nights (range = 1-15; n = 13) after the chicks hatched. At this stage, the hens became very vigilant to predators and human disturbance. If disturbed, they often abandoned the nests immediately and no longer returned thereafter. The ambient temperature at night during the early brooding period of Sichuan Partridge at our study site was similar to 12.4 degrees C. Our findings suggest that hen Sichuan Partridges may make trade-offs between nest predation risks versus the thermoregulatory needs of their young.","[Fu, Yiqiang; Wang, Shufang] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610101, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yiqiang] Leshan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Leshan 614004, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Benping] Laojunshan Natl Nat Reserve Adm, Pingshan 645350, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Dowell, Simon] North England Zool Soc, Chester Zoo, Chester CH2 1LH, Cheshire, England; [Zhang, Zhengwang] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",,"Fu, YQ (corresponding author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610101, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Zhang, ZW (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",fyq512@126.com; zzw@bnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31872961, 31272330]; Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China [2019HB2096001006]; National Forestry and Grassland Administration of China","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31872961 and 31272330), the biodiversity survey and assessment project of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China (2019HB2096001006), and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration of China.",,13,1,1,9,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2053-7166,,,AVIAN RES,Avian Res.,DEC 4,2020,11,1,,,,,,,47,10.1186/s40657-020-00233-6,,,4,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,PB1IN,WOS:000596083200001,,gold,,,2022-04-19,

Few studies, however, have documented selection on behavioural responses that increase individual survival under human hunting pressure. Using habitat with dense concealing cover is a common strategy for risk avoidance, with a higher chance of survival being the payoff. At the same time, risk avoidance can be costly in terms of missed foraging opportunities. We investigated individual fine-scale use of habitat by 40 GPS-marked European red deer, Cervus elaphus, and linked this to their survival through the hunting season. Whereas all males used similar habitat in the days before the hunting season, the onset of hunting induced an immediate switch to habitat with more concealing cover in surviving males, but not in males that were later shot. This habitat switch also involved a trade-off with foraging opportunities on bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, a key forage plant in autumn. Moreover, deer that use safer forest habitat might survive better because they make safer choices in general. The lack of a corresponding pattern in females might be because females were already largely using cover when hunting started, as predicted by sexual segregation theory and the risk of losing offspring. The behavioural response of males to the onset of hunting appears to be adaptive, given that it is linked to increased survival, an important fitness component. We suggest that predictable harvesting regimes with high harvest rates could create a strong selective pressure for deer to respond dynamically to the temporal change in hunting risk. Management should consider the potential for both ecological and evolutionary consequences of harvesting regimes on behaviour. (C) 2015 The Authors.

No differences in response to the fox were found for wild-caught and captive-born bettongs, even though wild-caught subjects were likely to have encountered canids prior to capture. Attempts to condition a fear response by quokkas to an odour were unsuccessful. An attempt to induce fear of the stuffed fox by linking to fear of humans in quokkas was unsuccessful, but quokkas generalised from fear of the dog to fear of the fox, despite a delay of several weeks.

In vertebrates, predation risk activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and there is growing evidence that activation of the maternal HPA axis can have intergenerational consequences via, for example, maternally-derived steroids in eggs. Here, we investigated how predation risk affects a suite of maternally-derived steroids in threespine stickleback eggs across nine Alaskan lakes that vary in whether predatory trout are absent, native, or have been stocked within the last 25 years. Using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), we detected 20 steroids within unfertilized eggs. Factor analysis suggests that steroids covary within and across steroid classes (i.e. glucocorticoids, progestogens, sex steroids), emphasizing the modularity and interconnectedness of the endocrine response. Surprisingly, egg steroid profiles were not significantly associated with predator regime, although they were more variable when predators were absent compared to when predators were present, with either native or stocked trout. Despite being the most abundant steroid, cortisol was not consistently associated with predation regime. Thus, while predators can affect steroids in adults, including mothers, the link between maternal stress and embryonic development is more complex than a simple one-to-one relationship between the population-level predation risk experienced by mothers and the steroids mothers transfer to their eggs.","[McGhee, Katie E.] Univ South, Dept Biol, Sewanee, TN 37375 USA; [Paitz, Ryan T.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Baker, John A.; Foster, Susan A.] Clark Univ, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Bell, Alison M.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Program Neurosci, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol,Carl R Woese, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"McGhee, KE (corresponding author), Univ South, Dept Biol, Sewanee, TN 37375 USA.",kemcghee@sewanee.edu,"Paitz, Ryan/A-8308-2008","Paitz, Ryan/0000-0003-4609-4359",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 1121980]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [PHS 1 R01 GM082937],"We thank past Alaskan field crews and Zhong Li at the Metabolomics Center, University of Illinois.

Because urban animals often experience reduced predation risk compared to their rural counterparts, and because escape behavior is energetically costly, we expect that urban environments will select for increased tolerance to humans. Many studies have supported this expectation by demonstrating that urban birds have reduced flight initiation distance (FID = predator-prey distance when escape by the prey begins) than rural birds. Here, we advanced this approach and, for the first time, assessed how 32 species of birds, found in 92 paired urban-rural populations, along a 3,900 km latitudinal gradient across Europe, changed their predation risk assessment and escape strategy as a function of living in urban areas. We found that urban birds took longer than rural birds to be alerted to human approaches, and urban birds tolerated closer human approach than rural birds. While both rural and urban populations took longer to become aware of an approaching human as latitude increased, this behavioral change with latitude is more intense in urban birds (for a given unit of latitude, urban birds increased their pre-detection distance more than rural birds). We also found that as mean alert distance was shorter, urban birds escaped more quickly from approaching humans, but there was no such a relationship in rural populations. Although, both rural and urban populations tended to escape more quickly as latitude increased, urban birds delayed their escape more at low latitudes when compared with rural birds. These results suggest that urban birds in Europe live under lower predation risk than their rural counterparts. Furthermore, the patterns found in our study indicate that birds prioritize the reduction of on-going monitoring costs when predation risk is low. We conclude that splitting escape variables into constituent components may provide additional and complementary information on the underlying causes of escape. This new approach is essential for understanding, predicting, and managing wildlife in a rapidly urbanizing world.","[Samia, Diogo S.

Humans have extirpated apex predators from many ecosystems, and the extent to which smaller predators, or humans themselves, can ecologically replace apex predators remains uncertain. White-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in the Eastern United States were released from their two most important predators a century ago following the extirpation of cougars Puma concolor and wolves Canis lupus. We studied the extent to which perceived predation risk from humans and a newly arrived mesopredator, the coyote, Canis latrans affects deer behavior, predicting that deer will be most vigilant in areas hunted by humans which also have the highest levels of coyote activity. We quantified deer vigilance rates in 33 natural areas of which 15 allowed hunting, across six states by evaluating the head posture of 3470 deer photographed at unbaited camera traps. We documented wide variation in coyote activity (0-2.5 detections/day) and human activity (0-306 detections/day), but contrary to our predictions, did not find strong positive relationships between deer vigilance and either of these predators. Deer vigilance was lower in areas with high levels of human recreation, suggesting that deer become habituated to the presence of humans. Vigilance increased across the fall season in both hunted and non-hunted populations, which suggests that increased vigilance may be associated more with mating behavior or environmental factors other than hunting. Our results show that variation in coyote and human activity does not significantly impact the vigilance behavior of white-tailed deer year-round, suggesting that deer rely on other risk-avoidance behaviors or neither are functioning as apex predators in the region.","[Schuttler, S.

It is a last line of defence against a threat, and usually follows physical restraint. Here, I report two lizards exhibiting tonic immobility in the presence of humans, but remarkably, without any handling or physical contact. These two lizards belonged to an invasive population of the Italian Wall Lizard (Podarcis siculus), and both events took place in different years and situations, suggesting this behaviour may be more common than previously thought. There are rare documented cases of animals exhibiting this behaviour without handling; however, to my knowledge, this is the first description of a lizard displaying tonic immobility to humans, in the absence of handling. This is also the first incident of tonic immobility in the Italian Wall Lizard. I discuss these anecdotal events in the light of this invasive population inhabiting a highly urbanized location.","[Damas-Moreira, Isabel] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Behav Ecol, Konsequenz 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",,"Damas-Moreira, I (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Dept Behav Ecol, Konsequenz 45, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",isabeldamas.m@gmail.com,"Damas Moreira, Isabel/I-3740-2014","Damas Moreira, Isabel/0000-0003-4630-3202",,,,35,1,1,3,6,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,JUN,2021,158,8-9,,,,,809,817,,10.1163/1568539X-bja10089,,,9,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,TG8RB,WOS:000671663700008,,,,,2022-04-19,

The most impressive effect of toxoplasmosis is the fatal attraction phenomenon, the conversion of innate fear of cat odour into attraction to cat odour in infected rodents. While most behavioural effects of toxoplasmosis were confirmed also in humans, neither the fatal attraction phenomenon nor any toxoplasmosis-associated changes in olfactory functions have been searched for in them. Principal Findings: Thirty-four Toxoplasma-infected and 134 noninfected students rated the odour of urine samples from cat, horse, tiger, brown hyena and dog for intensity and pleasantness. The raters were blind to their infection status and identity of the samples. No signs of changed sensitivity of olfaction were observed. However, we found a strong, gender dependent effect of toxoplasmosis on the pleasantness attributed to cat urine odour (p = 0.0025). Infected men rated this odour as more pleasant than did the noninfected men, while infected women rated the same odour as less pleasant than did noninfected women. Toxoplasmosis did not affect how subjects rated the pleasantness of any other animal species' urine odour; however, a non-significant trend in the same directions was observed for hyena urine. Conclusions: The absence of the effects of toxoplasmosis on the odour pleasantness score attributed to large cats would suggest that the amino acid felinine could be responsible for the fatal attraction phenomenon. Our results also raise the possibility that the odour-specific threshold deficits observed in schizophrenia patients could be caused by increased prevalence of Toxoplasma-infected subjects in this population rather than by schizophrenia itself. The trend observed with the hyena urine sample suggests that this carnivore, and other representatives of the Feliformia suborder, should be studied for their possible role as definitive hosts in the life cycle of Toxoplasma.","[Flegr, Jaroslav; Lenochova, Pavlina] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lenochova, Pavlina; Vondrova, Marta] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Dept Anthropol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hodny, Zdenek] Inst Mol Genet ASCR, Dept Genome Integr, Vvi, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Flegr, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Prague, Czech Republic.",flegr@cesnet.cz,"Flegr, Jaroslav/AAG-7568-2021; Hodny, Zdenek/C-9384-2009; Flegr, Jaroslav/A-1564-2008","Flegr, Jaroslav/0000-0002-0822-0126; Flegr, Jaroslav/0000-0002-0822-0126","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [0021620828]; Grant Agency of Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P303/11/1398]","The research was supported by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic, project 0021620828 and Grant Agency of Czech Republic, project P303/11/1398.

The time an animal spends in an area of a given size is termed 'first-passage time' and can be used to identify the scales at which different movement processes occur. Using first-passage time and 2-h observations, we identified nested spatial scales representing three movement behaviours for elk (Cervus elaphus) - inactive/ resting (moves < 50 m), active/foraging (<(x)over bar> = 276.7 m, SD = 56.6), and active/relocating ((x) over bar = 1628.3 m, SD = 436.6). Our ability to identify inactive behaviour was limited by GPS accuracy. The scale separating relocating and foraging behaviour. ranged 550-1650 m across individuals and varied quadratically with the mean patch size of cutover forest in an animal's home range. We classified path segments into the 3 movement behaviours and related behaviours to local. environmental conditions. Elk were likely to be inactive in areas having a low predicted use by wolves (Canis lupus), farther than 50 in from anthropogenic linear clearings, and where microclimatic conditions were cool (high shrub cover and north to east-facing slopes). In contrast, elk were most likely to forage in areas having intermediate levels of herbaceous biomass and low movement costs. Elk were most likely to be relocating when in areas of high wolf use, when close to linear clearings, and in energetically costly situations such as moving upslope. We discuss how elk use of potential foraging habitats may be restricted in this landscape by risks imposed by predators, humans, or both.","Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",,"Frair, JL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",jfrair@ualberta.ca,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020; Merrill, Evelyn/A-2668-2014; Morales, Juan/B-6316-2009; Beyer, Hawthorne/F-8050-2013; Merrill, Evelyn/N-5801-2015","Morales, Juan/0000-0001-7269-7490; Beyer, Hawthorne/0000-0002-5430-0784; Merrill, Evelyn/0000-0001-7737-958X; Frair, Jacqueline/0000-0002-8055-2213",,,,81,191,194,5,133,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Comparatively little is known about the effects of fathering on offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that fathers are capable of programming their offspring for the type of environment they are likely to encounter. Male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, were either exposed to predation risk while fathering or not. Fathers altered their paternal behaviour when exposed to predation risk, and consequently produced adult offspring with phenotypes associated with strong predation pressure (smaller size, reduced body condition, reduced behavioural activity). Moreover, more attentive fathers produced offspring that showed stronger antipredator responses. These results are consistent with behaviourally mediated paternal programming: fathers can alter offspring phenotypes to match their future environment and influence offspring traits well into adulthood.

Using high-resolution GPS-tracking data, this study explored the fine-scale movement patterns and risk sensitivity of crop-raiding African elephants, Loxodonta africana, in the anthropogenic landscape of Tsavo, Kenya. We analysed patterns in the speed and tortuosity of elephant movements over the 24 h surrounding crop-raiding events and compared them with those of nonraiding elephants during corresponding periods. Crop-raiding elephants moved faster and straighter (less tortuously) with closer temporal proximity to farmland, which we argue reflects their increased intensity of risk avoidance behaviours in response to approaching humans. Once inside farmland, elephants appeared to reduce movements associated with risk avoidance to forage intensively on crops, decreasing their speed and reducing the likelihood of moving in straight lines while crop raiding. These results highlight trade-offs in the fine-scale movement patterns of elephants living in anthropogenic landscapes with differing levels of habitat quality and exposure to humans, providing new insight into how they perceive the risks associated with crop raiding.

Females with cubs are often involved when humans are injured by brown bears Ursus arctos. In Scandinavia, this is particularly true for unarmed recreational forest users. Our aim was to document behavioural differences between single bears and females with cubs in order to develop recommendations to minimize the risk of injuries to recreational forest users. We documented the reactions of GPS-collared females with cubs and single brown bears to experimental approaches by humans to 50 m from the bear on 42 and 108 occasions, respectively. The majority of females with cubs (95%) and single bears (89%) left when approached. Bears that left were passed at shorter distances and were in more open areas than those that stayed. Both groups had similar flight initiation distances, which were longer for bears that were active at the time of the disturbance. Females with cubs selected more open habitat than single bears, also for the new site they selected following disturbance. Females with cubs, particularly active females with cubs of the year, moved greater distances and spent more time active following the approach. Females with cubs and single bears were seen or heard in 26% and 14% of the approaches, respectively. None of the bears displayed any aggressive behaviour during the approaches. Females with cubs selected more open habitat, perhaps predisposing them to encountering people that are not involved in hunting activities, which might be the primary explanation why females with cubs are most frequently involved when unarmed people are injured by bears in Scandinavia. To mitigate injury risks, one must consider factors that bring bears closer to human activity in the first place.","[Sahlen, Veronica; Ordiz, Andres; Swenson, Jon E.; Stoen, Ole Gunnar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway; [Ordiz, Andres] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway; [Stoen, Ole Gunnar] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",,"Sahlen, V (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway.",v.sahlen@gmail.com,"Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019; Støen, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020","Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Austrian Science FoundationAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Research Council of Norway (RCN)Research Council of Norway; Polish-Norwegian Research Program [POL-NOR/198352/85/2013]; program Adaptive management of fish and wildlife populations,"The Scandinavian Brown Bear Research Project (SBBRP) is funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management, Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, the Austrian Science Foundation and the Research Council of Norway (RCN).

Prevalence of 13 parasite species was similar across sites, but percentage of multiple infections and infection intensity differed, as did ground use. Chimpanzees at the long-term research site spent more time on the ground or on human trails.

However, it is unclear what abnormalities predate psychosis onset and whether abnormalities are related to behavioral performance and symptoms associated with psychosis risk. Using surface-based morphometry, we examined cortical volume, gyrification, and thickness in a psychosis risk group at long-term risk for developing a psychotic disorder (n = 18; i.e., extreme positive schizotypy plus interview-rated attenuated psychotic symptoms [APS]) and control group (n = 19). Overall, the psychosis risk group exhibited cortical abnormalities in multiple structural hub regions, with abnormalities associated with poorer probabilistic category learning, a behavioral measure strongly associated with psychosis risk. For instance, the psychosis risk group had hypogyria in a right posterior midcingulate cortical hub and left superior parietal cortical hub, as well as decreased volume in a right pericalcarine hub. Morphometric measures in all of these regions were also associated with poorer probabilistic category learning. In addition to decreased right pericalcarine volume, the psychosis risk group exhibited a number of other structural abnormalities in visual network structural hub regions, consistent with previous evidence of visual perception deficits in psychosis risk. Further, severity of APS hallucinations, delusional ideation, and suspiciousness/persecutory ideas were associated with gyrification abnormalities, with all domains associated with hypogyria of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex.

The present study investigated the possibility that the response to snake images is independent from visual awareness. The observers watched images of threatening and non-threatening animals presented in random order during rapid serial visual presentation. Four different masking conditions were used to manipulate awareness of the images. Electrophysiological results showed that the EPN was larger for snake images than for the other images employed in the unmasked condition. However, the difference disappeared when awareness of the stimuli decreased. Behavioral results on the effects of awareness did not show any advantage for snake images. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, some species exhibit high ecological plasticity, which allows them to persist in human-modified landscapes. The main goal of this study is to examine the relative roles of vegetation (mean distance among trees and mean canopy cover), human disturbance (distance to the road, distance to the fragment edge and edge type), and habitat spatial configuration (spatial autocorrelation index, category of quadrat - position within the fragment/fragment type) on the habitat selection of the black-tufted marmoset Callithrix penicillata in forest patches. We selected forest patches near and away from roads/urban areas, in southern Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil. We used generalized linear mixed models to explain the presence of black-tufted marmoset in those patches. Our results show that black-tufted marmoset tend to occupy forest fragments closer to roads/urban areas, and consequently are under the influence of anthropic disturbance. In addition to the area delimited by these fragments, there is a preference for edge environments, where disturbances are exacerbated and the ecological conditions are suitable for exploitation by the black-tufted marmoset (supply of gum trees and reduced risk of competition). We suggest that a cross-habitat spillover by marmoset occur from forests to small habitat patches close to human-modified areas, such as those in proximity to roads and urban zones.","[Secco, Helio; Grilo, Clara] Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Ecol Aplicada, Dept Biol, Campus Univ,CP 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, Brazil; [Bager, Alex] Univ Fed Lavras, Ctr Brasileiro Estudos Ecol Estr, Campus Univ,CP 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, Brazil",,"Secco, H (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Ecol Aplicada, Dept Biol, Campus Univ,CP 3037, BR-37200000 Lavras, Brazil.",hkcsecco@gmail.com,"Grilo, Clara/H-2002-2012","Grilo, Clara/0000-0001-9870-3115; Secco, Helio/0000-0002-2781-3226","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais - FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [CRA - PPM-00139-14, CRA - PPM-00139-453, CRA - APQ-03868-10]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [303509/2012-0]; Fundacao Grupo Boticario [0945-20122]; Tropical Forest Conservation Act - TFCA (Fundo Brasileiro para Biodiversidade - FUNBIO)","The authors thank all the researchers who offered their assistance in collecting field data, and in particular Hariagnes Oliveira and Paula D'Anunciacao.

For many species, such as large carnivores, movement patterns are greatly shaped by a combination of ecological and anthropogenic factors. Understanding how these factors impact the roaming capacity of large carnivores is essential to forecast risks and design long-term conservation strategies. The leopard (Panthera pardus) is a generalist predator broadly distributed over varied and different environments, but global leopard populations are declining at a concerning rate and conservation actions are pressing. This scenario makes the leopard a suitable species to understand how global ecological and anthropogenic drivers affect the spatial behaviour of large carnivores and how these should inform conservation efforts. We compiled data from local studies worldwide and used macroecological (climatic, productivity, and human footprint), and intra- and interspecific (conspecifics, competitors and prey) predictors to model the roaming requirements of leopards based on home range sizes. Male home range size was largely and positively related to the range sizes of local females and inversely to vegetation productivity. For females, higher seasonal variations in temperature like the observed in arid areas were associated with larger home ranges, while increased human impact resulted in smaller home ranges likely due to concentrated food resources such as domestic species. These predictors are linked to threatening global change processes due to anthropogenic activities that will likely impact the roaming behaviour of leopards in the coming decades with potential consequences for their populations worldwide. Our results provide crucial information towards the development of integrative research linking macroecological and local variables with global change predictions that can inform conservation programmes addressing future risks of degradation, endangerment and human-leopard conservation conflicts.","[Rodriguez-Recio, M.; Burgos, T.; Virgos, E.] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol, Fis & Quim Inorgan, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Rodriguez-Recio, M.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Krofel, M.] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Forestry, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Lozano, J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Biodiversidad Ecol & Evoluc, Unidad Docente Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Moleon, M.] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain",,"Rodriguez-Recio, M (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol, Fis & Quim Inorgan, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain.",mariano.recio@gmail.com,"Moleon, Marcos/K-2875-2014","Moleon, Marcos/0000-0002-3126-619X; Lozano, Jorge/0000-0002-1119-2197; Krofel, Miha/0000-0002-2010-5219","Formas project [2017-01443]; Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P4-0059, N1-0163]; Ram~on y Cajal from MINECO [RYC-2015-19231]","We are grateful to Pilar Salazar for initiating the compilation of the data.

However, these lesions have no effect on open-arm behavior in the elevated plus-maze or changes in startle reactivity induced by bright light. This raises the possibility that NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions alter operant behavior and/or appetitive state, as opposed to the aversive state operant suppression is supposed to index. To address this concern, the authors documented the effect of NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions on freezing induced by a component of fox feces (2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, [TMT]), a paradigm that does not involve food deprivation or operant performance. TMT presentation induced freezing behavior, and this effect was attenuated by NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions. Because predator odor presentation, but not presentation of a predator, induces defense behaviors that are sensitive to anxiolytic drugs, the results of the study suggest that NBM/SI corticopetal cholinergic lesions attenuate anxiety-like states.","[Brothers, Holly; Norman, Greg J.; Berntson, Gary G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Knox, Dayan] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Knox, D (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, VA Med Ctr, Res 11R,2215 Fuller Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",dayank@med.umich.edu,"Brothers, Holly/D-2148-2009","Brothers, Holly/0000-0001-8116-2682","NHLBI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [HL54428] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL054428] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,40,4,4,2,5,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

This variability is hypothesised to result from variation in the trade-offs associated with avoiding predators. But critical information on fitness outcomes of these trade-offs associated with anti-predator behaviours is lacking. We tested this trade-off hypothesis in Aedes aegypti, by examining oviposition site selection decisions in response towards larval predation risk and comprehensively measuring the fitness implications of trade-offs of avoiding larval predators, using three fitness measures: larval survival, development time and size. In a field study, we find that adult females show a surprisingly variable response to predators, ranging from attraction to avoidance. This variation is explained by fitness outcomes of oviposition along a predation-risk gradient that we measured in the laboratory. We show that ovipositing females could gain fitness benefits from ovipositing in pools with a low density of predators, rather than in predator-free pools, as predators provide a release from negative density effects of conspecific larvae that might co-occur in a pool. Interacting selection pressures may thus explain diverse prey responses. We suggest other systems in which similarly unexpected prey behaviour is likely to occur.","[Sharma, Manvi; Guttal, Vishwesha; Isvaran, Kavita] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Quader, Suhel] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India",,"Sharma, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India.",manvisharma@iisc.ac.in; suhelq@gmail.com; guttal@iisc.ac.in; kavita@iisc.ac.in,,,"Department of Biotechnology-Indian Institute of Science (DBT-IISc) partnership Grant; Department of Science and Technology-Fund for Improvement of S&T infrastructure (DST-FIST) Grant; Ministry of Human Resource Development-Indian Institute of Science for graduate scholarship; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology","We thank Mahalakshmi and Rajashree for maintenance of mosquito colony; Karthikeyan Chandrasegaran for discussions; Rishi Valley School and Indian Institute of Science for providing infrastructure.

Oxytocin's functions can be captured in two explanatory yet largely contradictory frameworks: the fear-dampening (FD) hypothesis that oxytocin has anxiolytic effects and reduces fear-motivated action; and the social approach/avoidance (SAA) hypothesis that oxytocin increases cooperative approach and facilitates protection against aversive stimuli and threat. We tested derivations from both frameworks in a novel predator-prey contest game. Healthy males given oxytocin or placebo invested as predator to win their prey's endowment, or as prey to protect their endowment against predation. Neural activity was registered using 3T-MRI. In prey, (fear-motivated) investments were fast and conditioned on the amygdala. Inconsistent with FD, oxytocin did not modulate neural and behavioral responding in prey. In predators, (greed-motivated) investments were slower, and conditioned on the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Consistent with SAA, oxytocin reduced predator investment, time to decide and activation in SFG. Thus, whereas oxytocin does not incapacitate the impulsive ability to protect and defend oneself, it lowers the greedy and more calculated appetite for coming out ahead.","[De Dreu, Carsten K.

More people express concerns about spending time in the forest, because of the possibility of encountering bears, and acceptance for the bear is decreasing. In this context, reliable information about the bear's normal behaviour during bear-human encounters is important. Here we describe the behaviour of brown bears when encountering humans on foot. During 2006-2009, we approached 30 adult (21 females, 9 males) GPS-collared bears 169 times during midday, using 1-minute positioning before, during and after the approach. Observer movements were registered with a handheld GPS. The approaches started 869 +/- 348 m from the bears, with the wind towards the bear when passing it at approximately 50 m. The bears were detected in 15% of the approaches, and none of the bears displayed any aggressive behaviour. Most bears (80%) left the initial site during the approach, going away from the observers, whereas some remained at the initial site after being approached (20%). Young bears left more often than older bears, possibly due to differences in experience, but the difference between ages decreased during the berry season compared to the pre-berry season. The flight initiation distance was longer for active bears (115 +/- 94 m) than passive bears (69 +/- 47 m), and was further affected by horizontal vegetation cover and the bear's age. Our findings show that bears try to avoid confrontations with humans on foot, and support the conclusions of earlier studies that the Scandinavian brown bear is normally not aggressive during encounters with humans.","[Moen, Gro Kvelprud; Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Sahlen, Veronica; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway; [Stoen, Ole-Gunnar] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway",,"Moen, GK (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway.",ole.stoen@umb.no,"Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019; Støen, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020; Swenson, Jon/E-2883-2013","Chiaradia, Andre/0000-0002-6178-4211","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, WWF Sweden; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; research program Adaptive Management of Fish and Wildlife'","The Scandinavian Brown Bear Research Project is funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management, the Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, WWF Sweden and the Research Council of Norway.

In the Iberian Peninsula, the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is an invasive species that is competing and displacing the endangered native Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa). We hypothesized that interspecific differences in antipredatory behavior might confer competitive advantages to introduced T. scripta. We examined whether interspecific differences in responses to predation risk affect the time that turtles remained hidden in the shell before using an active escape to water. Both turtle species adjusted hiding times by balancing predation threat, microhabitat conditions and the costs of remaining hidden. However, introduced T. scripta showed longer hiding times before escaping than native M. Leprosa, which, in contrast, switched from waiting hidden in the shell to escape to deep water as soon as possible. These interspecific differences might result from the risk of facing different types of predators in different microhabitats (land vs. water) in their original habitats. However, in anthropogenically altered habitats where predators have been greatly reduced, T. scripta may avoid potential costs of unnecessary repeated escape responses to water (e.g. interruption of basking). These behavioral asymmetries could contribute to the greater competitive ability of introduced T. scripta within anthropogenically disturbed environments.","[Polo-Cavia, Nuria; Lopez, Pilar; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain",,"Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",jose.martin@mncn.csic.es,"Lopez, Pilar/K-6221-2014; , Nuria/L-5372-2014; Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014","Lopez, Pilar/0000-0001-6577-1509; Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998",,,,51,50,56,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2008,114,2,,,,,115,123,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01441.x,,,9,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,251SC,WOS:000252393300002,,,,,2022-04-19,

And, while intensive research in the last century has led to well-supported generalizations about mechanisms of habituation, we have not developed a 'natural history' of habituation and tolerance that would help us predict, based on life history and natural history variation, how species will respond to humans and anthropogenic stimuli. The need for predictive models has never been greater. In this essay I will review generalizations about these learning processes and point out how a clear understanding of mechanism can be used to inform wildlife management and generate testable management interventions. I will also highlight unanswered questions about habituation and sensitization, and establish the groundwork for developing a natural history of habituation and tolerance.

The 'alert distance', i.e. the distance between a bird and an approaching person when the bird reacts visibly to the intruder, and the flight distance, the distance between the two when the bird takes flight, vary for different bird species. Such alert distances are less studied for passerines. This paper examines the alert and flight distances of ten variably sized passerine species in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. Subject birds were approached by an observer walking at a constant speed, using frontal and sideways approaches and either immobile or swinging arms, to test the hypothesis that alert distances vary according to human movements, bird size, and surrounding vegetation. All species recorded longer alert distances when the approaching person used a frontal, rather than a sideways approach, and also recorded longer alert and flight distances when the person used arm movements, as against walking with no arm movements. Apart from human arm movements, the strongest positive predictor of alert distances was bird size, while significant negative predictors were tree and shrub height and vegetation cover. Contrary to some other studies, increased vegetation height and cover more often reduced than increased alert distances, and open grass did not increase alert distances. Path and road proximity was not a significant predictor of alert distance. If sensitive to such issues, park design may include more trees and shrubbery, balancing conservation with human recreation and security concerns. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

The study aimed to quantify to what extent the risk of predation coinciding with an adverse environmental factor, high flow velocity, affects prey in terms of growth and energy expenditure. In this experiment, two measures of growth (i.e., body weight and length), condition, feeding, swimming cost and behavioral responses were analyzed. The results showed that in such an environment, prey showed lowered growth and were in a poorer condition. As the prey shifted to the shallow area with high flow velocity, the prey consumed a lower ration and incurred multiple costs for swimming locomotion that might reduce the allocation of energy to biomass and energy storage. Reduction in activity might decrease the cost of locomotion, but it did not have a considerable effect on overall swimming energy expenditure. In stream ecosystems, the high swimming energy expenditure appears to magnify the effects of predation risk by causing lowered growth and a poorer condition and, hence, fitness. The present study shows that high flow velocity is one of the environmental factors that determine the energetic responses of a potential prey to the presence of predators.","Saitama Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Human Engn, Sakura Ku, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan",,"Asaeda, T (corresponding author), Saitama Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Human Engn, Sakura Ku, 255 Shimo Okubo, Urawa, Saitama 3388570, Japan.",asaeda@post.saitama-u.ac.jp,"Fujino, Takeshi/A-3218-2012; Asaeda, Takashi/C-5278-2008","Sunardi, Sunardi/0000-0002-7972-3580",,,,45,15,15,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

We explored fleeing behaviour of two grasshopper species to test whether they modified escape behaviour when approached repeatedly. Schistocerca alutacea did not increase flight initiation distance (FID) upon repeated approach but fled farther. Psinidia fenestralis increased its FID on the second approach but decreased its flight distance over successive escapes. Both species showed a bimodal pattern of flight direction, either flying directly away or flying perpendicular to the direction of the observer's approach. Neither species showed a significant pattern of flight direction or change in flight direction with successive escapes. Most (88 %) P. fenestralis initially landed on sand, but after repeated approaches an increasing proportion landed in grass and hid. Both species therefore changed escape behaviour with persistent pursuit but used different tactics, suiting their flight ability or camouflage, and optimised habitat use. Three grasshopper species have now been examined for responses to repeated approach by predators and all show different tactics supporting escape decision theory. Our results emphasise the variety of escape responses across species and how the dynamic nature of escape responses vary according to an animal's situation. Rather than single optimum escape options, each grasshopper species shows a range of responses, which vary with risk from persistent predators. Although grasshoppers provide an excellent model, it would be profitable to examine responses of a range of species according to levels of predation risk.","[Bateman, Philip W.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Fleming, Patricia A.] Murdoch Univ, Perth, WA 6150, Australia",,"Bateman, PW (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",bill.bateman@curtin.edu.au; t.fleming@murdoch.edu.au,"Bateman, Bill/B-7751-2019","Bateman, Bill/0000-0002-3036-5479; Fleming, Patricia/0000-0002-0626-3851",,,,49,17,17,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) use both sources of information to learn the facial features of a dangerous person. We exposed wild crows to a novel 'dangerous face' by wearing a unique mask as we trapped, banded and released 7-15 birds at five study sites near Seattle, WA, USA. An immediate scolding response to the dangerous mask after trapping by previously captured crows demonstrates individual learning, while an immediate response by crows that were not captured probably represents conditioning to the trapping scene by the mob of birds that assembled during the capture. Later recognition of dangerous masks by lone crows that were never captured is consistent with horizontal social learning. Independent scolding by young crows, whose parents had conditioned them to scold the dangerous mask, demonstrates vertical social learning. Crows that directly experienced trapping later discriminated among dangerous and neutral masks more precisely than did crows that learned through social means. Learning enabled scolding to double in frequency and spread at least 1.2 km from the place of origin over a 5 year period at one site.","[Cornell, Heather N.; Marzluff, John M.; Pecoraro, Shannon] Univ Washington, Coll Environm, Sch Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Marzluff, JM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Coll Environm, Sch Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",corvid@uw.edu,,"Marzluff, John/0000-0002-6266-4975; Cornell, Heather/0000-0001-7888-9856",US ArmyUnited States Department of Defense; College of Forest Resources at the University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington; NSF BCSNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0508002],"The authors thank L.

We collected behavioural observations in two leks and radiotracking data on 67 deer over 7 years. Two deer sub-populations were present in the northern and southern sides of the area, respectively, the two sectors being delimited by a river and including one lek each. Predictions were tested for one lek (SG), located in the south-side where we set up our 7-year radiotracking program. Data from a second lek (FO, north-side) were used to test those predictions which imply the occurrence of multiple leks in the same population. We showed that the majority of females made one single visit to one lek, only during the rut. The lek was located outside areas of higher female traffic and home range overlap, and females increased home range sizes during the rut to reach it. Twilight routes of females never crossed the lek; instead, females walked atypical routes and at a faster pace to reach the lek and mate. The distance between the two leks was higher than the average diameter of female home ranges, and only one lek was present within female home ranges. Males reached the lek one month before the arrival of females, corroborating that lekking is a female-initiated process (females moving towards large clumped male aggregations) rather than a male-initiated process (males moving towards female hotspots). Our results supported the female preference model, and rejected the predictions of the hotspot model. Also, leks were located far from areas with higher predation risk, supporting the predator avoidance model. The position of lek SG resulted 'handy' at the sub-population level because of the optimal trade-off between travel costs for females to reach it and avoidance of human predators.","[Apollonio, Marco; De Cena, Fabio; Bongi, Paolo] Univ Sassari, Dept Sci Nat & Environm Resources, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Ciuti, Simone] Univ Freiburg, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",,"Ciuti, S (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Dept Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",simone.ciuti@biom.uni-freiburg.de,"Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013","Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509","EEC HUMAN CAPITAL AND MOBILITY [ERBCHRXCT940674]; Italian Ministry of Education PRINMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN) [9705242520_010, 9905101114_002]","This study was funded by EEC HUMAN CAPITAL AND MOBILITY (ERBCHRXCT940674; coordinator Dr. Rauno V.

Although this alert distance has been studied before, no consideration has been devoted to the relationship between vigilance behavior and the probabilities of detecting pedestrians. Our goal was to test whether and how differences in scanning behavior of two model species (spot-winged pigeon and eared dove) would affect the predicted and observed probabilities of detection of pedestrian approaches in two conditions: individuals foraging alone and in flocks. Overall, we found differences between species and between foraging conditions, but no interaction effects. Spot-winged pigeons and individuals foraging alone spent more time scanning, with longer scanning bout duration, than eared doves and individuals foraging in groups, respectively. Spot-winged pigeons showed greater alert distances (observed detection probabilities) than eared doves, and so did solitary individuals as compared to individuals foraging in groups. Greater scanning time may have increased predicted and observed detection probabilities of spot-winged pigeons. Expected probabilities of detection of pedestrian approaches were higher for group than for solitary foraging conditions, contrary to observed alert distances, probably due to a lack of collective detection in flocks. Our results suggest that vigilance behavior can affect the distance at which birds detect human disturbance and the estimation of tolerance. This behavioral effect could have implications in management scenarios (e.g. determining buffer areas), as similar levels of human visitation to protected areas may exert different effects according to the probabilities of detecting visitors within the detection windows of different species.

This approach can be applied to predict the potential effects of such activities on animal behavior and individual condition that could lead, in turn, to alterations in vital rates and, ultimately, long-term population change. We developed an agent-based model to describe the effect of interactions with tourism on the behavior of bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound (New Zealand). The model describes the temporal variation of the individuals' hidden motivational states, the way in which these states interact to determine the activity of groups of dolphins, and the feedback influence of the group's activity on individual motivations and condition. Moreover, it realistically simulates the movement of dolphin groups in the fiord. The model also includes tour boat behavior, incorporating the way key geographical features attract these boats. In addition to tourism effects, we accounted for the spatial heterogeneity in both dolphin activities and shark predation risk. The final simulation platform generated a realistic representation of the social and behavioral dynamics of the dolphin and boat populations, as well as observed patterns of disturbance. We describe how this tool could be used to ensure effective management of the interactions between anthropogenic factors and bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, and how it could be adapted to evaluate the effects of human disturbance on other comparable populations. We then fitted the dolphin component of the model to data collected during visual studies of the Doubtful Sound dolphin population between 2000 and 2002 using a Bayesian multi-state modeling framework. However, when the parameter estimates from this fitting process were used in the agent-based model, biologically realistic representations of the population were not generated. Our results suggest that visual data from group follows alone are not sufficient to inform such agent-based models. Information on the spatial structure of the animals' activities and an appropriate measure of individual condition are also required for successful model parameterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, in natural settings, accessibility and energetic harvest costs may vary spatially, and GUDs may be confounded. In this study, we assessed whether at a heterogeneous site, non-experimental GUDs could reveal the effect of disturbance. We measured initial and GUDs of tubers of Fennel Pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus, which form here the exclusive food source of Bewick's Swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii during their migratory stopover. We calculated giving-up net energy intake rates (GUNs) by correcting for biomass accessibility and foraging costs. The study area was a shallow lake consisting of nine creeks, three of which were open to the public (i.e. disturbed). GUDs in creeks open or closed to the public were not significantly different. In contrast, GUNs were generally higher in creeks open to the public, after correcting for initial net energy intake rate. The results suggest that natural GUDs may not reflect the effects of disturbance in heterogeneous habitats. When environmental differences are large within a site, GUNs may be a useful alternative as a behavioural indicator.","[Gyimesi, Abel; Franken, Marycha S.; Feige, Nicole; Nolet, Bart A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Biol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Franken, Marycha S.] Univ Utrecht, Grad Sch Life Sci, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Gyimesi, A (corresponding author), Dept Bird Ecol, Varkensmarkt 9, NL-4101 CK Culemborg, Netherlands.",a.gyimesi@buwa.nl,"Nolet, Bart A/C-1416-2008; Gyimesi, Abel/F-8604-2010; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Nolet, Bart A/0000-0002-7437-4879; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",NWO-ALWNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [814.01.008],"We thank all those who assisted during the fieldwork: Peter de Vries, Thijs de Boer, Koos Swart, Marcel Klaassen, Frederike Raassen, Liesbeth Bakker, Rommert Cazemier, Oane Tol, Boris Arevalo, Bert Hidding, Mariska Nieuwenhuijsen, Susan Zwerver, Sam Varghese, Casper van Leeuwen, Linda Franken and Stefan de Klepper.

Because predators hunt using stealth and surprise, there is a widespread ability among prey to assess risk from chemical information - scents - in their environment. Consequently, scents often act as particularly strong modulators of memory and emotions. Recent advances in ecological research and analytical technology are leading to novel ways to use this chemical information to create effective attractants, repellents and anti-anxiolytic compounds for wildlife managers, conservation biologists and health practitioners. However, there is extensive variation in the design, results, and interpretation of studies of olfactory-based risk discrimination. To understand the highly variable literature in this area, we adopt a multi-disciplinary approach and synthesize the latest findings from neurobiology, chemical ecology, and ethology to propose a contemporary framework that accounts for such disparate factors as the time-limited stability of chemicals, highly canalized mechanisms that influence prey responses, and the context within which these scents are detected (e.g. availability of alternative resources, perceived shelter, and ambient physical parameters). This framework helps to account for the wide range of reported responses by prey to predator scents, and explains, paradoxically, how the same individual predator scent can be interpreted as either safe or dangerous to a prey animal depending on how, when and where the cue was deposited. We provide a hypothetical example to illustrate the most common factors that influence how a predator scent (from dingoes, Canis dingo) may both attract and repel the same target organism (kangaroos, Macropusspp.). This framework identifies the catalysts that enable dynamic scents, odours or odorants to be used as attractants as well as deterrents. Because effective scent tools often relate to traumatic memories (fear and/or anxiety) that cause future avoidance, this information may also guide the development of appeasement, enrichment and anti-anxiolytic compounds, and help explain the observed variation in post-traumatic-related behaviours (including post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) among diverse terrestrial taxa, including humans.","[Parsons, Michael H.] Hofstra Univ, Dept Biol, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Parsons, Michael H.] Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Apfelbach, Raimund] Univ Tubingen, Inst Neurobiol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Banks, Peter B.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Cameron, Elissa Z.; Frank, Anke S.

Studies on the anti-disturbance mechanism of wild animals to human disturbance can provide valuable knowledge to the management of wild animals and the evolutionary mechanisms of behavioral adaptation to their habitats. To evaluate how blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) would react to nonlethal human recreational disturbance, we studied their anti-disturbance strategy towards human disturbance in Suyukou National Forest Park (SNFP), Helan Mountains, Yinchuan of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Using multinomial logistic regression models (MLRMs), we sought to answer two questions: (1) which kind of human recreational behavior would evoke the most serious anti-disturbance behaviors in blue sheep; and (2) how would various ecological factors influence the anti-disturbance strategy of blue sheep to human recreational disturbance? We collected 10 habitat and population variables and evaluated three kinds of reaction of blue sheep-no response, vigilance and flight. A total of 921 observations qualified to enter MLRMs. We found that habitat type (HT), gender (GEN), head direction (HD), visibility index (VI), and disturbance source (DS) were the five variables that significantly influenced the intensity of reactions of blue sheep. Blue sheep were more alert to tourists than to vehicles, and roads were the habitat type that caused the most intensive reaction of alertness where human disturbance was the highest. Females were more vigilant than males. Blue sheep might feel safer when staying in open habitat, and taking a front head direction provided them with the highest vigilance. Based on these results, we present suggestions to SNFP for the management of ecotourism and blue sheep conservation.","[Jiang TianYi; Ding YouZhong; Wang ZhengHuan] E China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Wang XiaoMing] Shanghai Sci & Technol Museum, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China; [Liu ZhenSheng] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resources, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Wang ZhengHuan] E China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Urbanizat & Ecol Restorat, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",,"Wang, ZH (corresponding author), E China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",zhwang@bio.ecnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970371, 31071944]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in UniversityProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-08-0753]; Optional Project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region [2011-017]","We thank the officials and forest guards in Helan Mountains National Reserve for their help in logistics and background information related with the study.

Habitat alteration often leads to changes in habitat complexity and predation risk, which may serve as additional stressors for those species that rely on mangroves for protection from predators. However, few studies have been conducted to date to assess the effects of these specific stressors on glucocorticoid (GC) stress hormone levels in wild fish populations. Using the checkered puffer as a model, our study sought to examine the effects of physical habitat complexity and predator environment on baseline and acute stress-induced GC levels. This was accomplished by examining changes in glucose and cortisol concentrations of fish placed in artificial environments for short periods (several hours) where substrate type and the presence of mangrove roots and predator cues were manipulated. Our results suggest that baseline and stress-induced GC levels are not significantly influenced by changes in physical habitat complexity or the predator environment using the experimental protocol that we applied. Although more research is required, the current study suggests that checkered puffers may be capable of withstanding changes in habitat complexity and increases in predation risk without experiencing adverse GC-mediated physiological effects, possibly as a result of the puffers' unique morphological and chemical defenses that help them to avoid predation in the wild.

Risk effects arise when prey alter their behaviour in response to predators. This response may carry costs through its impact on fitness-related activities such as foraging. We recorded behavioural responses of whale sharks Rhincodon typus to experimental vessel and swimmer approaches. We simulated the disturbance caused by ecotourism in the foraging site of this planktivorous fish in Bahia de Los Angeles, Gulf of Baja California, Mexico. Stress-related behaviours (vigilance, change of direction, diving and acceleration) were more common directly after both types of disturbance than before, in particular after approach by a swimmer. Individuals were more likely to be vigilant when they were new to the bay, but we did not find evidence of within-season behavioural habituation. Sharks were 24% more likely to forage before human stimuli than after. Our study highlights negative effects of vessel and swimmer approaches on whale shark behaviour, with a short-term increase in stress-related behaviours potentially carrying energetic costs, combined with a decrease in food intake following the disturbance. Our results indicate concerns about the impact of ecotourism on large fish species. An important next step would be to determine whether these short-term behavioural responses to the perception of predation risk negatively affect fitness. Among other guidelines, we recommend preventing swimmers from approaching if whale sharks stop feeding when a vessel approaches.","[Montero-Quintana, Austin N.; Osorio-Beristain, Marcela] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Conservac, Ave Univ 1001, Cuernavaca 62209, Morelos, Mexico; [Vazquez-Haikin, J.

The spread of invasive species is also facilitated by human activity, further increasing the pressure on native species. In two experiments, we measured the foraging efficiency, risk perception and inter-individual consistency of risk-taking (personality variation in boldness) of an invasive species, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and a threatened tilapia, the Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), in clear and turbid water. In experiment one, O. niloticus was faster to initiate feeding, encountered more food items and consumed more than O. amphimelas. The latency to start foraging by O. niloticus decreased in turbid water. Turbidity did not affect the latency to start foraging in O. amphimelas but the number of food items they encountered was highest at the intermediate turbidity. There was however no significant effect of turbidity in either species on the total food consumed. In contrast to this foraging context, in experiment two with a refuge and no food available, risk taking behaviour was similar in both species and they both responded with similarly reduced risk taking in turbid water. Evidence of personality variation was weak, being observed only in O. amphimelas when first leaving the shelter in turbid water. Overall, species differences were greater in the foraging context but turbidity was more important in the risk-taking context. O. amphimelas is more sensitive to turbidity during foraging, and O. niloticus is likely to have a competitive advantage in foraging situations, especially in degraded turbid habitats.Significance statementUnder human-induced environmental change, native species are often exposed to multiple stressors. Here, we tested the responses of two cichlid fish to increasing turbidity, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), which is invasive throughout the tropics, and the Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), a threatened species, indigenous to Tanzania. We found that turbidity was beneficial to the foraging of O. niloticus, which in both clear and turbid water consumed and encountered more food than O. amphimelas. In contrast, without food present, both species displayed similar responses of increased risk perception in turbid water with little evidence of personality variation between individuals in either species. Our results suggest that invasive species tolerant of degraded habitats may outcompete less well-adapted native species for food.","[Wing, Jonathan D.

We show how the response of overwintering oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus to disturbance is related to their starvation risk of avoiding disturbance. As winter progresses, oystercatcher energy requirements increase and their feeding conditions deteriorate. To survive they spend longer feeding and so have less spare time in which to compensate for disturbance. Later in winter, birds approach a disturbance source more closely and return more quickly after a disturbance. Their behavioural response to disturbance is less when they are having more difficulty surviving and hence their starvation risk of avoiding disturbance is greater. These results have implications for studies which assume that a larger behavioural response means that a species is more vulnerable to disturbance. The opposite may be true. To more fully understand the impact of disturbance, studies should measure both behavioural responses and the ease with which animals are meeting their requirements. Conservation effort should be directed towards species which need to spend a high proportion of their time feeding, but still have a large response to disturbance.","Winfrith Technol Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol CEH, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England",,"Stillman, RA (corresponding author), Winfrith Technol Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol CEH, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England.",,"Stillman, Richard/B-6018-2009",,,,,23,68,81,1,28,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0908-8857,,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

From prey remains at hawk nests, we estimated the frequency of prey species in the diet of hawks. For each hawk pair, RPR values for different prey species were calculated. The mean RPR for each prey species, based on hawk pairs as sample units, indicated degree of overrepresentation (positive RPR) Or. underrepresentation (negative RPR) Of the prey in the diet. Prey species with a high positive RPR nested mainly near human habitations (villages or towns), at forest edges and in farmland. However, there were marked seasonal changes in RPR. Forest birds, such as the goldcrest and wren, had the highest RPR in April. Later, the hawks seemed to hunt mainly in the habitats mentioned above, where prey were more abundant or easier to catch, resulting in increasing RPR for the house sparrow, yellowhammer, greenfinch and other species. RPR values were analysed in relation to prey body size (mass) and relative density, as well as prey foraging height and nest height (categorized from the literature). In addition, the mean perch height and mean exposure of prey species were quantified in the field. Most predation was due to the smaller male hawks, providing food for their mates and young. RPR increased with prey body size up to a mass of about 40 g, then declined with increasing body size (larger prey being more difficult to catch). RPR decreased with increasing relative density of prey species. Nest height was not correlated with RPR, but foraging height seems to be an important factor: RPR decreased with increasing foraging height. A similar result was found for mean perch height, when larger prey (over 40 g) and singing individuals were excluded from the field data. RPR increased with mean exposure of prey species when larger prey and singing birds were excluded; a combination of perch height and exposure improved the correlation with RPR. Singing birds were generally perched high in the vegetation and may not suffer high predation risk, contrary to common belief. The results of this study are discussed in relation to temporal and geographical variation in RPR and antipredator adaptations in passerine birds.",,,"Gotmark, F (corresponding author), GOTHENBURG UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,MEDICINAREGATAN 18,S-41390 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,56,147,155,1,70,ROYAL SOC LONDON,LONDON,"6 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON, ENGLAND SW1Y 5AG",0962-8436,,,PHILOS T ROY SOC B,Philos.

Obligate sociality leads to increased competition for resources, meaning that animals may face a trade-off between safe positions within the troop and increased foraging efficiency. Dominance has been proposed to be a major factor influencing spatial position within primate troops, but it is also possible that animals can improve their spatial position using social strategies, such as grooming. In many species, dominance rank and social preference (as expressed through grooming) are confounded. In our study population of vervet monkeys, however, dominance does not underpin social preference, enabling us to test whether 1) more sociable vervets experience reduced exposure to predation risk, as indexed by vigilance, and 2) that dominant animals accepted increased risk in order to forage at the front of the troop. We collected spatially explicit data on the individual locations of members of 2 troops at predetermined times over a 4-month period. We constructed bounded Voronoi tessellations for each temporal snapshot, with the area of each animal's tile identifying its domain of danger. We also collected data on time spent vigilant and foraging, dominance rank, and grooming behavior. We found no effect of dominance, but animals with larger grooming networks were less exposed to predation risk, from which they benefitted through both reduced vigilance and increased foraging time. We interpret these results in the light of current debates about the ways in which sociality affects fitness.","[Josephs, Nathan; Bonnell, Tyler; Dostie, Marcus; Barrett, Louise; Henzi, S.

While several studies have reported that acute exposure to EDCs can cause changes in reproductive traits, we are in the early stages of discerning whether such changes have significant deleterious fitness consequences. In this study, chronic exposure of threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to an environmentally relevant level of an EDC used in the birth control pill and post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy produced changes in growth and behavior that were related to fitness. Exposure to 100 ng/l ethinyl estradiol accelerated growth rate and increased levels of behavior that makes individuals more susceptible to predation (activity and foraging under predation risk). Moreover, the costs of exposure to ethinyl estradiol took their ultimate toll via mortality later in life, and were particularly high for females and for one population. The ecological approach taken in this work revealed heretofore unexamined effects of EDCs and has direct implications for the way we evaluate the impact of EDCs in the environment; (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Models for FID have been used with some success to predict distance fled (DF). We studied effects of foraging opportunity cost of fleeing and examined differences between age-sex groups in the omnivorous Balearic Lizard, Podarcis lilfordi. Balearic lizards forage on the ground for invertebrate prey and climb the thistle Carlina corymbosa to forage on its inflorescences. We studied escape behaviour in three experimental groups, with human beings as simulated predators: lizard foraging above ground on C.corymbosa, foraging on the ground away from thistles and on the ground with cut inflorescences. Flight initiation distance was shorter for lizards with cut inflorescences than for (1) lizards above ground due to the greater risk above ground due to conspicuousness of black lizards on yellow flowers; and (2) lizards on ground away from flowers due to the cost of leaving while feeding. The only age-sex difference was slightly greater FID for adult males than subadults, presumably because larger adult males are more likely to be attacked by predators. Other potential factors affecting this difference are discussed. Experimental group and age-sex group did not interact for FID or DF. Because lizards foraging on inflorescences above ground fled to the base of the plants to refuge provided by spiny thistle leaves, their DF was shorter than in the other groups, which fled across the ground, usually without entering refuge. DF did not differ between groups on the ground or among age-sex groups. The predicted shorter DF for lizards with cut inflorescences than on ground without inflorescences did not occur. We hypothesize that the opportunity cost was small due to the abundance of blooming thistles and that DF may be less sensitive to opportunity cost than FID.","[Perez-Cembranos, Ana; Perez-Mellado, Valentin] Univ Salamanca, Fac Farm, Dept Anim Biol, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain; [Cooper, William E.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA",,"Perez-Cembranos, A (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Farm, Dept Anim Biol, 5A Planta,Campus Unamuno, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain.",anapercem@usal.es,"Pérez-Cembranos, Ana/H-8542-2015; Perez-Mellado, Valentin/G-3476-2015","Pérez-Cembranos, Ana/0000-0002-8296-2283; Perez-Mellado, Valentin/0000-0002-7137-4945",Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL 2009-12926-C02-02]; FEDER funds from the European UnionEuropean Commission; FPU grant from the Spanish Ministerio de EducacionGerman Research Foundation (DFG),"This work was supported by research project CGL 2009-12926-C02-02 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation co-funded by FEDER funds from the European Union.

Several studies have shown that predation-related cues can affect sea urchin movement and grazing rates, but generalisations about the types of cues that prompt responses and the magnitude of those responses will require further research on a wider variety of species. We examined the effects of potential alarm cues on behaviour of the habitat-forming sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus (Echinometridae) on fished rocky reefs in northeastern New Zealand, where predators are uncommon and the sea urchins form barrens. Exposed E. chloroticus (i.e. those not in crevices) rapidly fled from injured conspecifics within a 1 m radius of the cue, but showed no apparent reaction to injured sea urchins belonging to another family (Centrostephanus rodgersii, Diadematidae), diced pilchards or the disturbance caused by fish attracted to the cues. Densities of exposed sea urchins in an area containing injured conspecifics did not return to control values for at least 20 h, while cryptic individuals remained crevice-bound when injured conspecifics were nearby. Injured conspecifics thus provide a strong, albeit localised, cue for E. chloroticus. By restricting sea urchins to crevices where they have a reduced impact on living kelp, this non-consumptive effect may complement the lethal effects of predation in marine reserves where populations of predators such as rock lobsters and large fish are allowed to recover from overharvesting by humans, thereby reinforcing the trophic cascade initiated by those predators.","[Spyksma, Arie J.

In the present study I investigated the validity of the specific traits for predicting typical behaviour in everyday life. A questionnaire with items describing the dog's typical behaviour in a range of situations was sent to owners of dogs that had carried out the DMA behavioural test 1-2 years earlier. Of the questionnaires that were sent out 697 were returned, corresponding to a response rate of 73.3%. Based on factor analyses on the questionnaire data, behavioural factors in everyday life were suggested to correspond to the specific personality traits from the DMA. Correlation analyses suggested construct validity for the traits playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, sociability, and distance-playfulness. Chase-proneness, which I expected to be related to predatory behaviour in everyday life, was instead related to human-directed play interest and nonsocial fear. Aggressiveness was the only trait from the DMA with low association to all of the behavioural factors from the questionnaire. The results suggest that three components of dog personality are measured in the DMA: (1) interest in playing with humans; (2) attitude towards strangers (interest in, fear of, and aggression towards); and (3) non-social fearfulness. These three components correspond to the traits playfulness, sociability, and curiosity/fearlessness, respectively, all of which were found to be related to a higher-order shyness-boldness dimension. Chase-proneness and distance-playfulness seem to be mixed measures of these personality components, and are not related to any additional components. Since the time between the behavioural test and the questionnaire was 1-2 years, the results indicate long-term consistency of the personality components. Based on these results, the DMA seems to be useful in predicting behavioural problems that are related to social and non-social fear, but not in predicting other potential behavioural problems. However, considering this limitation, the test seems to validly assess important aspects of dog personality, which supports the use of the test as an instrument in dog breeding and in selection of individual dogs for different purposes.

The distribution of humans among habitats should, as in other animals, be governed by density-dependent feedback on fitness. It should be possible, therefore, to merge human habitat selection - and, perhaps, other adaptive behaviours - with projections of human population size to forecast future threats to biodiversity. We evaluate this deceptively simple postulate by developing a model of human habitat selection. We test it with World Resources Institute (WRI) data and use the resulting pattern to predict threats to biodiversity. Humans select urban over rural habitats in a way that is consistent with an evolutionarily stable strategy of habitat selection. The choice of habitat is modified by per capita energy use. The pattern of habitat use is associated with increased threats to the biodiversity of mammals, birds and higher plants, but not that of reptiles. We use WRI projections of future human populations to predict the anticipated pattern of human habitat use in 2020. We then use the new distribution to calculate changes in threats to biodiversity and rank nations according to their projected threats. African nations rank consistently higher than nations from any other region. Preventive global conservation might, therefore, be most productively concentrated on helping Africa.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Lakehead Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Environm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada",,"Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",douglas.morris@lakeheadu.ca,,,,,,55,17,18,5,39,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

For example, previous studies have shown that female threespined stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exposed to predation risk produce offspring with altered behavior, metabolism and stress physiology. Here, we investigate the effect of maternal exposure to predation risk on the embryonic transcriptome in sticklebacks. Using RNA-sequencing we compared genome-wide transcription in three day post-fertilization embryos of predator-exposed and control mothers. There were hundreds of differentially expressed transcripts between embryos of predator-exposed mothers and embryos of control mothers including several non-coding RNAs. Gene Ontology analysis revealed biological pathways involved in metabolism, epigenetic inheritance, and neural proliferation and differentiation that differed between treatments. Interestingly, predation risk is associated with an accelerated life history in many vertebrates, and several of the genes and biological pathways that were identified in this study suggest that maternal exposure to predation risk accelerates the timing of embryonic development. Consistent with this hypothesis, embryos of predator-exposed mothers were larger than embryos of control mothers. These findings point to some of the molecular mechanisms that might underlie maternal effects.","[Mommer, Brett C.; Bell, Alison M.] Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Dept Anim Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"Mommer, BC (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Dept Anim Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",bmommer2@illinois.edu,,"Mommer, Brett/0000-0001-8721-7154",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 1121980]; National Institutes of Health R01United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM082937]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM082937] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Division Of Integrative Organismal SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1121980] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant IOS 1121980), www.nsf.gov, and the National Institutes of Health R01 (GM082937), www.nih.gov.

The life-long presence of dormant stages of this parasite in the brain and muscular tissues of infected humans is usually considered asymptomatic from the clinical point of view. In the past 20. years, research performed mostly on military personnel, university students, pregnant women and blood donors has shown that this 'asymptomatic' disease has a large influence on various aspects of human life. Toxoplasma-infected subjects differ from uninfected controls in the personality profile estimated with two versions of Cattell's 16PF, Cloninger's TCI and Big Five questionnaires. Most of these differences increase with the length of time since the onset of infection, suggesting that Toxoplasma influences human personality rather than human personality influencing the probability of infection. Toxoplasmosis increases the reaction time of infected subjects, which can explain the increased probability of traffic accidents in infected subjects reported in three retrospective and one very large prospective case-control study. Latent toxoplasmosis is associated with immunosuppression, which might explain the increased probability of giving birth to a boy in Toxoplasma-infected women and also the extremely high prevalence of toxoplasmosis in mothers of children with Down syndrome. Toxoplasma-infected male students are about 3. cm taller than Toxoplasma-free subjects and their faces are rated by women as more masculine and dominant. These differences may be caused by an increased concentration of testosterone. Toxoplasma also appears to be involved in the initiation of more severe forms of schizophrenia. At least 40 studies confirmed an increased prevalence of toxoplasmosis among schizophrenic patients. Toxoplasma-infected schizophrenic patients differ from Toxoplasma-free schizophrenic patients by brain anatomy and by a higher intensity of the positive symptoms of the disease. Finally, five independent studies performed in blood donors, pregnant women and military personnel showed that RhD blood group positivity, especially in RhD heterozygotes, protects infected subjects against various effects of latent toxoplasmosis, such as the prolongation of reaction times, an increased risk of traffic accidents and excessive pregnancy weight gain. The modern human is not a natural host of Toxoplasma. Therefore, it can only be speculated which of the observed effects of latent toxoplasmosis are the result of the manipulation activity of the Toxoplasma aimed to increase the probability of its transmission from a natural intermediate to the definitive host by predation, and which are just side effects of chronic infection.","Charles Univ Prague, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Flegr, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",flegr@cesnet.cz,"Flegr, Jaroslav/A-1564-2008; Flegr, Jaroslav/AAG-7568-2021","Flegr, Jaroslav/0000-0002-0822-0126; Flegr, Jaroslav/0000-0002-0822-0126",Grand Agency of the Czech Republic [P303/11/1398]; Charles University of Prague [UNCE 204004],This study was supported by the Grand Agency of the Czech Republic [grant no.

Methods: We tested whether introduced Rock (Columba livia) and Spotted (Streptopelis chinensis) Doves, historically long-term residents of Melbourne, Australia, were more tolerant of disturbance by humans than the very recent colonist, the native Crested Pigeon (Ochyphaps lophotes) by comparing the Flight Initiation Distances (FID) and time allocations to vigilance during foraging of all three species in urban Melbourne. That all three species are members of the Columbiformes reduces the possibility that any species differences in tolerance are simply phylogenetic in origin. Results: Flight initiation distance was shorter in Rock Doves than in the other two species, which did not differ in approachability by a human. Rock Doves retreated from an approaching human mainly by walking a relatively short distance, Crested Pigeons mainly by running a relatively short distance and Spotted Doves primarily by flying a comparatively long distance. The time allocation to anti-predator vigilance of Rock Doves was smaller than that of the other two species, whose allocations were similar. Conclusions: The very recent colonist of eastern Melbourne, the Crested Pigeon, was not the least tolerant of disturbance by humans of the three related species. Natural selection for tolerance therefore probably cannot entirely explain the pattern of tolerance evident among these urban dove species and behavioural flexibility is probably involved. Length of residency in a city is not an infallible guide to a species' level of tolerance of disturbance by humans.","[Gendall, Jemma; Lill, Alan] Monash Univ, Wildlife Ecol & Conservat Physiol, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Lill, Alan] La Trobe Univ, Sch Life Sci, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia",,"Lill, A (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Wildlife Ecol & Conservat Physiol, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton Campus, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",A.Hirund@gmail.com,,,,,,35,10,12,1,33,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2053-7166,,,AVIAN RES,Avian Res.,JUN 1,2015,6,,,,,,,,7,10.1186/s40657-015-0018-x,,,8,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,DD4OT,WOS:000369903100001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-19,

In marine protected areas (MPAs), fish feeding may cause changes in the behavior, and thus the density and distribution, of coastal fish species. We evaluated spatial variability in human-positive fish behavior around the Ustica Island MPA (Italy) and the potential indirect effects of behavioral change on other species. Two mensurative experiments demonstrated that ca. 1/3 of the species present in fish-feeding areas exhibited human-positive behavior, losing instinctive fear in the presence of humans and encircling people in the water even when food was not provided. A manipulative experiment demonstrated that this behavioral response was learned rapidly. Damselfishes were negatively affected by the unnatural aggregation of a labrid species, as these aggregations frequently attacked and destroyed the benthic nests of the damselfish. Thus, fish feeding can have both direct and indirect effects. Therefore the MPA management goals need to be explicitly stated on a case-by-case basis. If the aim of a reserve is only to promote awareness of marine life and the benefits of conservation to the public, activities such as fish feeding may be regarded as desirable, since the human-positive behavior brought about by this activity guarantees a visual spectacle for visitors. Fish-feeding locations, however, cannot be regarded as natural and may reduce the effectiveness of a reserve for scientific research.","Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Biol Anim, I-90123 Palermo, Italy; Univ Bologna, Ctr Interdipartimentale Ric Sci Ambientali Ravenn, I-48100 Ravenna, Italy",,"Milazzo, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Biol Anim, Via Archirafi 18, I-90123 Palermo, Italy.",marmilazzo@iol.it,"Milazzo, Marco/AAY-9990-2021; Willis, Trevor/F-5337-2012; Milazzo, Marco/F-8596-2012","Willis, Trevor/0000-0002-0357-1189; Milazzo, Marco/0000-0002-2202-0542",,,,31,47,48,0,26,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We applied a modification of variance partitioning and a hierarchical partitioning analysis to test several hypotheses that attempt to explain the recent large-scale disappearance of Egyptian Vulture breeding territories in Spain. Our aim was to identify and then separate the simple (or pure) from the combined effects of habitat features, human pressure, and the social behavior of the species on the risk of extinction from a territory while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Deviance partitioning showed that a complex mix of factors is significantly related to the disappearance of more than 400 territories throughout Spain. Abandoned territories were located in areas that are isolated from other conspecific territories and far from communal roost sites. In addition, these territories were found in places where there is a lack of natural habitats, high habitat fragmentation and reduced habitat diversity, and where food availability seems to be low and the illegal use of poison to control predators is a common practice. Deviance partitioning also showed an important spatial component in the probability of extinction. Abandoned territories were not randomly distributed; rather, they were aggregated in extinction 'hotspots', mainly related to food availability and human pressure. Deviance partitioning turned out to be an useful tool for identifying the relative contribution of a variety of factors - and their combined effects - associated with an extinction process. The deviance explained by each factor must be interpreted, however, in the context of a good knowledge of the life history of the species. Hierarchical partitioning can help rank conservation priorities and, by using as an objective criterion the relative weight of each independent variable that could be effectively managed for conservation, may provide wildlife managers with a means of saving funds and optimizing action plans.

Research has suggested that beliefs about risks and benefits associated with carnivores affect their acceptance. Using results from a 2013 mail survey of hunters and trappers who participated in the season, we employed mediation analysis to examine how risk- and benefit-based beliefs influenced the relationship between attitudes about wolves and management preferences and behavioral intentions. Analyses differentiated hunters and trappers. Beliefs about risks and benefits partially explained the relationship between attitudes and wolf management preferences among hunters, while risk-based beliefs fully accounted for management preferences in the trapper sample. Beliefs about risks associated with wolves were most strongly related to management preferences among both hunters and trappers. Beliefs about the risks wolves present to desired game species may be symbolic among hunters and trappers, therefore, managers may be challenged to gain support for recovering wolf populations among these stakeholders.","[Schroeder, Susan A.] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 200 Hodson Hall,1980 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Fulton, David C.] Univ Minnesota, US Geol Survey, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Cornicelli, Louis] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Div Fish & Wildlife, St Paul, MN USA; [Bruskotter, Jeremy T.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Schroeder, SA (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 200 Hodson Hall,1980 Folwell Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",sas@umn.edu,"Bruskotter, Jeremy T/B-3240-2012; Schroeder, Susan/AAS-9623-2020","Bruskotter, Jeremy T/0000-0002-1782-7835; Schroeder, Susan/0000-0002-9077-9913",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,Funding was provided by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.,,48,6,6,5,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1087-1209,1533-158X,,HUM DIMENS WILDL,Hum.

Results suggested that habitat deterioration in ski slopes not only implied a loss of optimal habitat for lizards, but also led to an increase in perceived risk of predation. Males seemed to adjust their movement patterns to differences in risk, increasing their movement speed during their displacements across risky areas within ski slopes, but as a consequence, they incurred loss of body condition. A laboratory experiment supported that fleeing at high speeds in areas without refuges can be a factor responsible for reduced body condition. However, changes in body condition did not affect sprint speed of lizards. Our study provides new evidence that behavioral strategies to cope with increased predation risk, due to human-induced habitat deterioration, may affect body condition of lizards. Our results have applications for the design of conservation plans for this endangered lizard species. Environmental impact studies should be performed before opening new ski slopes, but taking into account not only the presence of lizards but also their body condition. An effective way to decrease the effects of habitat loss may be the artificial restoration of some refuges to create safe corridors for movement. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, little is known about processes regulating these novel ecosystems, or behaviours employed by species adapting to them. We evaluated the isotopic niche of an apex carnivore, the cougar (Puma concolor), over broad spatiotemporal scales and in a region characterized by rapid landscape change. We detected a shift in resource use, from near complete specialization on native herbivores in wildlands to greater use of exotic and invasive species by cougars in contemporary urban interfaces. We show that 25 years ago, cougars inhabiting these same urban interfaces possessed diets that were intermediate. Thus, niche expansion followed human expansion over both time and space, indicating that an important top predator is interacting with prey in novel ways. Thus, though human-dominated landscapes can provide sufficient resources for apex carnivores, they do not necessarily preserve their ecological relationships.","[Moss, Wynne E.; Pauli, Jonathan N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Alldredge, Mathew W.; Logan, Kenneth A.] Colorado Pk & Wildlife, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA",,"Moss, WE (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",wmoss@wisc.edu,,"Moss, Wynne/0000-0002-2813-1710",Colorado Parks Wildlife,"This study was funded by Colorado Parks & Wildlife.

A previous study showed that male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, reduced courtship towards females that had previously been exposed to predation risk compared to unexposed females. This suggests that males can detect a female's previous history with predation risk, but the mechanisms by which males assess a female's history are unknown. To determine whether males use chemical and/or visual cues to detect a female's previous history with predation risk, we compared rates of courtship behaviour in the presence of visual and/or olfactory cues of predator-exposed females versus unexposed females in a 2 x 2 factorial design. We found that males differentiate between unexposed and predator-exposed females using visual cues: regardless of the olfactory cues present, males performed fewer zigzags (a conspicuous courtship behaviour) when they were exposed to visual cues from predator-exposed females compared to unexposed females. However, males' response to olfactory cues changed over the course of the experiment: initially, males performed fewer courtship displays when they received olfactory cues of predator-exposed females compared to unexposed females, but they did not discriminate between cues from predator-exposed and unexposed females later in the experiment. A follow-up experiment found that levels of cortisol released by both predator-exposed and unexposed females decreased over the course of the experiment. If cortisol is linked to or correlated with olfactory cues of predation risk that are released by females, then this suggests that the olfactory cues became less potent over the course of the experiment. Altogether, these results suggest that males use both visual and olfactory cues to differentiate between unexposed and predator-exposed females, which may help ensure reliable communication in a noisy environment.

In this study, we evaluated the relative contribution of information held by the population majority versus new immigrants to groups in determining group function. To do so, we created experimental groups of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola that were either iteratively exposed to a dangerous predator, the ant Anoplopepis custodiens, or kept in safety. We then seeded these groups (i.e., the population majority) with an immigrant individual that either had or did not have prior experience with the predator and was either shy or bold. Bold group members are argued to be particularly influential for group function in S. dumicola. We then evaluated colonies' response towards predators over multiple trials to determine the effect of the immigrant's and the majority's prior experience with the predator and the immigrant's boldness. We found that groups adopt a better safe than sorry strategy, where groups avoided predators when either the group or the immigrant had been previously exposed to risk, regardless of immigrant boldness. These findings suggest that past experience with predators, even if only experienced by a single individual in the group, can alter how groups respond to risk in a potentially advantageous manner.","[Wright, Colin M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, 201 Main, University Pk, PA 16801 USA; [Lichtenstein, James L.

Animals may perceive anthropogenic features and people as threats, exhibiting avoidance behavior, or may acclimate to human activities. As development expands globally, changes in the ecology of species in response to human phenomena may determine whether animals persist in these changing environments. We hypothesize that American black bears (Ursus americanus) persist within developed areas by effectively avoiding risky landscape features. We test this by quantifying changes in the movements of adult females from a population living within exurban and suburban development. We collected hourly GPS data from 23 individuals from 2012 to 2014 and used step-selection functions to estimate selection for anthropogenic features. Females were more avoidant of roads and highways when with cubs than without and were more responsive to increased traffic volume. As bears occupied greater housing densities, selection for housing increased, while avoidance of roads and responsiveness to traffic increased. Behavioral flexibility allowed bears in highly developed areas to alter selection and avoidance for anthropogenic features seasonally. These findings support the hypothesis that black bears perceive human activity as risky, and effectively avoid these risks while inhabiting developed areas. We document a high amount of individual variation in selection of anthropogenic features within the study population. Our findings suggest that initially, wildlife can successfully inhabit developed landscapes by effectively avoiding human activity. However, variation among individuals provides the capacity for population-level shifts in behavior over time.","[Evans, Michael J.; Rittenhouse, Tracy A.

To understand the effects of specific types of human disturbance on antipredator behavior, a behavior whose performance enhances survival, we studied yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). We quantified both antipredator vigilance and the flight initiation distance of the marmots to an approaching human in six different colony sites where we also quantified the frequency and type of human visitation. We developed an analysis framework, using linear mixed models, and found that: (1) when the presence of motorized vehicles and bicycles was high, marmots increased the proportion of time spent vigilant (pseudo R-2 = 0.33 and 0.31 for motorized vehicles and bicycles, P < 0.05) and decreased the time spent foraging (pseudo R-2 = 0.29 and 0.23 for motorized vehicles and bicycles, P < 0.05), (2) there was no significant effect of the presence of pedestrians on the time allocated to vigilance and foraging (pseudo R-2 = 0.25 and 0.19, P > 0.05), (3) marmots decreased the flight initiation distance as disturbance of motorized vehicles (pseudo R-2 = 0.85) and pedestrians (pseudo R-2 = 0.84) increased (P < 0.05), and (4) when we considered bicycles as the disturbance, juveniles tolerated closer approaches than adults or yearlings (P < 0.001). Marmots thus responded to some human disturbance by adjusting time spent in foraging and shortening the tolerance distance. Since these behavioral responses could have significant implications for survival and reproduction, we should generally view human disturbance as something that can influence natural antipredator behavior. Importantly, based on an understanding of the differential effects of human activities on wildlife, reducing human disturbance should be taken into account for wildlife management. In addition, our approach will be useful to quantify differential effects of humans on wildlife and to enhance our ability to manage those impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain how species manage living in heterogeneous and complex anthropogenic habitats. The ability of individuals or species to beneficially modify their behaviors in response to changes in the environment has indeed been alternatively explained based on phylogenetic, adaptive, and ontogenic arguments. In this study we investigated the role of sociality as a driver of behavioural flexibility in urban birds. Sociality can be defined as the tendency to associate with conspecifics or form a group and may influence a species' ability to survive in an urban ecosystem to the extent that it represents advantages to species or individuals in terms of resource exploitation, fitness, and predation risk-avoidance. Given the potential benefits of sociality we hypothesized that sociality is a further characteristic that may explain how species have successfully expanded their range into urbanized areas. Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that pigeons (Columba livia) will show higher behavioural flexibility when in larger groups, whatever their genetic background and living-circumstances. Using pigeons as a model system, we compared 27 groups in France and Italy composed of four different genetic strains and varying living-conditions: free-living feral pigeons in urban areas, free-living domestic pigeons at the property of a local breeder captive, feral pigeons in a French ecological field station, captive domestic pigeons in an Italian ecological station. We tested two standardized behavioral measures of behavioural flexibility: thresholds for fear or neophobia and rates of problem solving. We found that group number affects neophobia and to a lesser extent problem-solving, suggesting that sociality is a factor enhancing birds' faculties to establish in and cope with heterogeneous urban environments. We consider this hypothesis here as compatible and complementary to existing hypotheses on species' adaptation to urban ecosystems.","[Skandrani, Zina; Prevot, Anne-Caroline] UPMC, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, UMR SU 7204,CNRS, CP 51,55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bovet, Dalila] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Lab Ethol Cognit Dev, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Gasparini, Julien] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm Paris, UPEC,Paris 7,CNRS,INRA,IRD, F-75005 Paris, France; [Baldaccini, Natale Emilio] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Etol Ecol & Evoluz, I-56126 Pisa, Italy",,"Skandrani, Z (corresponding author), UPMC, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat CESCO, UMR SU 7204,CNRS, CP 51,55 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",zina.skandrani@mnhn.fr; dalila.bovet@u-paris10.fr; julien.gasparini@upmc.fr; ebaldaccini@biologia.unipi.it; anne-caroline.prevot@mnhn.fr,"Gasparini, Julien/J-9263-2012",,,,,36,5,5,0,53,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,1573-1642,,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,JUN,2017,20,3,,,,,609,615,,10.1007/s11252-016-0618-1,,,7,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Urban Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,EU5LY,WOS:000401074200008,,,,,2022-04-19,

Although ultrasound presentation rarely induces convulsions, the locomotor bursts exhibited resemble pn-convulsant running. The present studies examined the interactions between strychnine treatment and experimenter-presented ultrasounds on behaviour in male Lister hooded rats. Strychnine was selected because it is a potent and effective convulsion-inducing agent which is not known to induce anxiety in humans. Behaviour in a circular arena (75 cm diameter) was observed live, videotaped and traced electronically. In experiments 1 and 2, moderate (60 s) or relatively brief (15 s) exposure to an ultrasound stimulus (20 kHz, 98 dB, SPL) typically resulted in 5- to 10-s bursts of locomotion in saline-treated subjects; strychnine treatment (0.5, 0.7, 1.0 mg/kg, injected IP, 10 min prior to testing) significantly increased this ultrasound-induced locomotion in a dose-dependent manner. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the strychnine enhancement of the ultrasound response was not different in naive animals when compared to those subjects which had received occasional strychnine and/or ultrasound treatment previously. Experiment 3 also demonstrated that strychnine treatment can cause at least modest running in subjects exposed to a 2 kHz tone (96 dB SPL). In experiment 4, exposure to the 20 kHz, 98 dB ultrasound stimulus for a much longer period, 9 min, resulted in irregular cycles of bursts of locomotion, followed immediately by periods of relative inactivity in saline-treated animals; approximately 10% of these subjects exhibited tonic-clonic convulsions. No convulsions occurred in strychnine-treated subjects during the period 10-20 min post-injection in the absence of ultrasound exposure, in contrast, the frequency of occurrence of convulsions in strychnine-treated subjects (10-20 min post-injection) exposed to the ultrasound stimulus was greater than 50%; these convulsions typically occurred at the end of a locomotor burst. The results of the present studies suggest that then may be a relationship between ultrasound-induced locomotor bursts and convulsant activity.","Wayne State Univ, Coll Pharm & Allied Hlth Profess, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; Univ Nottingham, Queens Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England",,"Commissaris, RL (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Coll Pharm & Allied Hlth Profess, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",,"Stevens, David/F-4683-2015",,,,,23,11,11,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,MAR,1998,136,2,,,,,162,171,,10.1007/s002130050552,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,ZD380,WOS:000072679400009,9551773,,,,2022-04-19,

Therefore, effective wildlife management, including harvesting through hunting is becoming increasingly important. However, current hunting practices often fail to diminish those negative effects, as many ungulate species retreat to areas unsuitable for hunting. This predator-avoidance behaviour makes it difficult to fulfill the demand of reducing population numbers. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative and effective wildlife management tools to counteract this problem. Here we provide for the first time a hunting suitability model for wild ungulate management in mountainous landscapes to visualise hunting suitability objectively and realistically. Using red deer as a model species, we modelled hunting suitability with high spatial resolution (10 x 10 m), based on remote sensing information, field surveys and expert knowledge of professional hunters. We analysed spatio-temporal habitat selection by radio-collared deer in relation to locations of varying hunting suitability. The suitability of various locations regarding hunting influenced the spatio-temporal habitat selection by this species, consistent with our hypothesis. Red deer avoided areas suitable for hunting during daylight hours in the hunting season, but not during the night. This species seems to perceive a landscape of heterogeneous anthropogenic predation risk, shaped by locations of various hunting suitability, as we modelled it. This confirms the empirical realism of the model. Concerning wild ungulate management, our hunting suitability model provides high-resolution predictions of where species like red deer will retreat when perceived anthropogenic predation risk increases. The model also yields useful insights regarding the hunting suitability of particular locations, which is valuable information especially for non-locals. Furthermore, the model can serve as planning tool to inform decisions about where particular hunting strategies can be performed most efficiently to manage wild ungulates and therefore minimize human-wildlife conflicts.","[Griesberger, Paul; Obermair, Leopold; Hacklaender, Klaus] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Wildlife Biol & Game Management, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Vienna, Austria; [Obermair, Leopold] Lower Austrian Hunting Org, Vienna, Austria; [Zandl, Josef] Gutsverwaltung Fischhorn GmbH & Co KG, Kaprun, Austria; [Stalder, Gabrielle; Arnold, Walter] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Dept Interdisciplinary Life Sci, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Vienna, Austria",,"Griesberger, P (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Wildlife Biol & Game Management, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Vienna, Austria.",paul.griesberger@boku.ac.at,,"Griesberger, Paul/0000-0002-3071-8422","Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG); Gletscherbahnen Kaprun AG; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (BOKU)","This research was funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), Gletscherbahnen Kaprun AG and the owner of the study site, Gutsverwaltung Fischhorn GmbH & Co KG.

We hypothesized that, in temperate latitudes of cold winter climate, with low cloudiness and under windless conditions, birds should select sunlit sites (i.e., forest sectors or trunk patches with high levels of exposure to sunlight) to reduce the metabolic cost of thermoregulation. At a within-habitat scale, a hypothesis of only metabolic benefits predicts that birds should select sunlit patches at shade temperatures (T-shade) below the birds' lower critical temperature (T-lc). They should shift to a random use of sunlit and shaded patches at temperatures above T-lc. Alternatively, there could be added costs (e.g., travel costs, predation risk) in using sunlit patches. If higher visibility leads to diminished crypsis at sunlit patches (trade-off with predation risk hypothesis), birds should select only shaded patches at T-shade values above T-lc, (tu enhance crypsis). They should increasingly select sunlit patches as T-shade decreases below T-lc. Treecreepers were selective in their use of jun-shade parches, across different spatial scales. At the among-plots scale, treecreeper abundance was positively related to the availability of sunlit trunks, after we controlled for the effects of tree density, prey availability, and altitude. At the within-plot scale (i.e., selection of foraging patches on thrunks and thick branches), Ivlev's electivity for sunlit patches decreased lineal ly as T-shade increased. Birds preferred to forage on sun-exposed surfaces (electivity >0) when T-shade was lower than similar to4 degreesC, but they tended to forage on shaded surfaces (electivity < 0) when T-shade was higher than similar to9 degreesC. The selection of sunlit trunk patches at low temperatures was not a by-product of higher food availability, because numbers of prey were much less predictable than temperature as a function of trunk exposure (sun vs. shade), and the negative relationship between use of sunlit parches and temperature remained significant when we controlled for the effects of prey availability. Thus, the selection of sunlit patches at low temperatures can be interpreted as a behavioral thermoregulation strategy allowing birds to save energy. However, the Ivlev's electivity for sunlit patches became negative at temperatures a ell below T-lc, and no sunlit patches were used when T-shade approximate to T-lc, which led us to reject the only metabolic benefits hypothesis. Photometric measurements of treecreeper taxidermic mounts realistically positioned on trunk surfaces, and detection times by simulated (human) predators, suggest that treecreepers were more detectable under direct solar radiation than in deep shade. Crypsis diminished in sunlit patches because of a higher image contrast and an increased difference in perceivable coloration between bird and background, relative to shaded patches. Average detection times were significantly lower for sunlit mounts. Moreover, focal birds scanned more frequently in sunlit than in shaded patches. Thus, the observed temperature-dependent variation in the selection of sunlit substrata is consistent with the trade-off with predation risk hypothesis predicting that prey should avoid parches where they are more detectable to potential predators. We interpret the distribution and behavior of treecreepers as indicative of a trade-off between the energy savings (through higher operative temperature and reduced metabolic costs) and the increased risk of predation (through higher visibility and diminished crypsis) afforded by sunlit foraging patches.","CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim Vertebrados 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",,"Carrascal, LM (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",mcnc152@mncn.csic.es,"Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016; Díaz, José A./H-5559-2015","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Díaz, José A./0000-0001-6047-5065",,,,60,58,59,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2001,82,6,,,,,1642,1654,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1642:BTBTTO]2.0.CO;2,,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,446PG,WOS:000169521200012,,,,,2022-04-19,

Recent studies indicate substantial parallels between eliciting stimuli, behaviors, and functional outcomes for RA in animal models and people, and a rapidly growing literature suggests that some exaggerated or aberrant RA behaviors may be transdiagnostic components of anxiety and depressive disorders. Although the subcortical components of defense systems have been well mapped, RA, standing at the 'interface of cognition and emotion', appears to involve a more extensive cortical representation than other specific defenses. Recent analyses of metanetworks potentially interacting with the subcortical defense systems suggest that the Default Mode Network and the Salience Network may be strongly involved in RA.","[Blanchard, D.

Sleeping sites were distributed throughout home ranges, including areas where they overlapped with neighbors, and appeared to be selected independently of habitat characteristics. Individuals did not build night nests or otherwise manipulate the vegetation around the sleeping place but slept on open branches. Group members usually slept in separate trees, and, except for females with infants, they never shared a sleeping place. Sleeping trees were entered several hours before dusk and were used for about 14-17 h. The majority of sleeping trees were used only once, and fewer were selected repeatedly by the same or other group members. Usually females with infants went into a sleeping tree first, then juveniles, and last were mostly subadult and adult males. Intragroup competition over access to a sleeping place was observed once. Average time difference between the first and last group member to enter a sleeping tree was 13 min. The sequence of departure from sleeping trees was more variable. Gibbon sleeping habits seem to primarily reflect adaptations to minimize predation risk. The predation-risk hypothesis was indirectly supported by observations of mobbing pythons, alarm calls given in response to birdes of prey flying low over the canopy, and more importantly by 1) the predominant use of large sleeping trees, which were among the tallest trees available, particularly by adult females with small infants and juveniles, 2) an unpredictable long-term pattern of reuse of sleeping places, and 3) inconspicuous presleep behavior.

Identifying brain sites involved could provide important mechanistic insight into the illness. In mice, the amygdala has been suggested to promote CO2 responses; however, recent studies in humans with amygdala damage indicate the amygdala is not required for CO2-induced fear and panic and might actually oppose these responses. To clarify the role of the amygdala, we produced lesions in mice paralleling the human lesions, and characterized behavioral responses to CO2. Compared to sham controls, we found that amygdala-lesioned mice froze less to 10% CO2, and unlike shams they also began to jump frenetically. At 20% CO2, controls also exhibited jumping, suggesting it is a normal response to more extreme CO2 concentrations. The effect of amygdala lesions was specific to CO2 as amygdala-lesioned mice did not jump in response to a predator odor or to an auditory conditioned stimulus. In amygdala-lesioned mice, jumping evoked by 10% CO2 was eliminated by colesioning the dorsal periaqueductal gray, a structure implicated in panic and escape-related behaviors. Together, these observations suggest a dual role for the amygdala in the CO2 response: promoting CO2-induced freezing, and opposing CO2-induced jumping, which may help explain the exaggerated CO2 responses in humans with amygdala lesions.","[Taugher, R.

We caged bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) for 28 days at two sites downstream (adjacent to and 870 m) from a wastewater treatment plant and at a reference site without wastewater inputs. We found that exposed fish had a dampened response to simulated predation compared to unexposed fish, suggesting that fish may be at greater risk of predation after exposure to wastewater effluent.

Behavior is expected to be a major factor driving animals' responses to global change because it largely determines how animals interact with the environment. However, the role of individual variation in behavior to facilitate the persistence of animals in changing environments remains poorly understood. Here, we adopted an animal personality approach to investigate whether different behavioral traits allow animals to deal with two major components of global change: urbanization and biological invasions. By studying six populations of Anolis sagrei lizards, we found for the first time that anoles vary consistently in their behavior across different times and contexts. Importantly, these animal personalities were consistent in the wild and in captivity. We investigated whether behavioral traits are pulled in different directions by different components of global change. On the one hand, we found that lizards from urban areas differ from nearby forest lizards in that they were more tolerant of humans, less aggressive, bolder after a simulated predator attack, and they spent more time exploring new environments. Several of these risk-taking behaviors constituted a behavioral syndrome that significantly differed between urban and forest populations. On the other hand, the behavior of urban A.sagrei coexisting with the invasive predatory lizard Leiocephalus carinatus was associated with dramatic changes in their foraging niche. Overall, we provide evidence that differences in animal personalities facilitate the persistence of animals under novel selective regimes by producing adaptive behaviors relevant to their ecology such as predator avoidance. Our results suggest that natural selection can favor certain behaviors over others when animals are confronted with different ecological challenges posed by global change. Therefore, we underscore the need to incorporate behavioral ecology into the study of how animals adaptively respond to human-induced environmental changes.","[Lapiedra, Oriol; Chejanovski, Zachary; Kolbe, Jason J.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",,"Lapiedra, O (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Lapiedra, O (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",olapiedragonzalez@fas.harvard.edu,,"Lapiedra, Oriol/0000-0003-0383-0061",University of Rhode Island; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354897]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1354897] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank Jonathan Losos, Manuel Leal, and Tom Schoener, members of the Kolbe Lab at the University of Rhode Island and Losos Lab at Harvard University and Marta Mele for providing helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript and Kevin Aviles-Rodriguez for assistance in the field.

This difference has long been assumed to reflect human female reproductive constraints, particularly caring for and provisioning mates and offspring. Long-term studies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) enable tests of hypotheses about the possible origins of human sex differences in hunting, prior to pair-bonding and regular provisioning. We studied two eastern chimpanzee communities (Kasekela, Mitumba) in Gombe, Tanzania and one (Kanyawara) in Kibale, Uganda. Relative to males, females had low hunting rates in all three communities, even where they encountered red colobus monkeys (the primary prey of chimpanzees) as often as males did. There was no evidence that clinging offspring hampered female hunting. Instead, consistent with the hypothesis that females should be more risk-averse than males, females at all three sites specialized in low-cost prey (terrestrial/sedentary prey at Gombe; black and white colobus monkeys at Kanyawara). Female dominance rank was positively correlated with red colobus hunting probability only at Kasekela, suggesting that those in good physical condition were less sensitive to the costs of possible failure. Finally, the potential for carcass appropriation by males deterred females at Kasekela (but not Kanyawara or Mitumba) from hunting in parties containing many adult males. Although chimpanzees are not direct analogs of the last common ancestor (LCA) of Pan and Homo, these results suggest that before the emergence of social obligations regarding sharing and provisioning, constraints on hunting by LCA females did not necessarily stem from maternal care. Instead, they suggest that a risk-averse foraging strategy and the potential for losing prey to males limited female predation on vertebrates. Sex differences in hunting behavior would likely have preceded the evolution of the sexual division of labor among modern humans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Amulti-modal study,PEERJ,,,English,Article,,,,,,Multimodal risk assessment; Giant clam; Multisensory risk assessment; Anthropogenic noise,WATER-FLOW; BEHAVIOR; NOISE; RISK; PREDATORS; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; BIVALVIA; TREEFROG; HONEYBEE,"To properly assess risk, an animal must focus its attention on relevant external stimuli; however, attention can be reallocated when distracting stimuli are present. This reallocation of attention may interfere with an individual's ability to effectively assess risk and may impede its response. Multiple stimuli presented together can have additive effects as distractors, and these include stimuli in different modalities. Although changes in noise and water flow are detectable by some bivalves, this has not been studied in the context of risk assessment or distraction. We experimentally exposed giant clams (Tridacna maxima) to changes in water particle movement through underwater sound (motorboat noise) and increased water flow to determine whether these stimuli, individually or together, modified risk assessment or caused distraction. We found that dams responded to sound, flow, and their combination by increasing frequency of mantle retractions (a potential anti-predator response) when exposed to a stimulus. Sound alone did not change risk assessment in either the latency to close or to reemerge following closure. However, when exposed to both stimuli simultaneously, clams increased their latency to close. We suggest that clams perceive sound and flow in an additive way, and are thus distracted. Interestingly, and uniquely, clams discriminate these multimodal stimuli through a single sensory modality. For sessile clams, anthropogenic noise is detectable, yet unavoidable, suggesting that they be especially vulnerable to marine noise pollution.","[Doyle, Ryan; Kim, Jonathan; Pe, Angelika; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,"Doyle, Ryan/0000-0003-3830-2154",UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,"This work was supported by the UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

In aquatic mammals, USWS permits sleep and breathing to occur concurrently in water. However, the function of avian USWS has been unclear. Our study is based on the premise that avian USWS serves a predator detection function, since the eye contralateral to the awake hemisphere remains open during USWS. If USWS functions as a form of predator detection, then birds should be able to control both the proportion of slow-wave sleep composed of USWS and the orientation of the open eye in response to changes in predation risk. To test these predictions we recorded eye state and the EEG of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) sleeping in groups of four birds arranged in a row. Birds at the ends of the row were more exposed than those in the central positions, who were flanked on both sides by other birds, and thus should perceive a greater risk of predation. Consistent with a predator detection function, when compared to birds in the group's center, birds at the exposed ends of the row showed a 150% increase in USWS and a preference for directing the open eye away from the group, the direction from which a predator is most likely to approach. Furthermore, during USWS mallards responded rapidly to threatening visual stimuli presented to the open eye. This ability to facultatively control sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain probably involves the neuroanatomical interhemispheric separation responsible for independent hemispheric functioning during wakefulness in birds.

In human-modified environments, anthropic factors may play a role. We assessed the influence of ecological (predation), social (intergroup competition), and anthropic (proximity to human settlements) factors in sleeping site choice by long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) occupying a habitat at the interface of natural forests and human-modified zones in Bali Barat National Park, Indonesia. Over the course of 56 nights, we collected data relating to physical features of sleeping trees, patterns of the use of sleeping sites within the home range, pre-sleep behavior, diurnal ranging patterns and availability of natural and human food. Overall, the macaques used 17 sleeping sites with 37 sleeping trees. When the monkeys slept in forest zones, they selected sleeping trees that had larger trunks but were not significantly taller than surrounding trees. Though the macaques rarely re-used sleeping sites on consecutive nights, they frequently re-used four sites over the study period. The group favored sleeping within the core area of its home range, despite the occurrence of frequent agonistic intergroup encounters there. Macaques preferentially selected sleeping trees located within or near human-modified zones, especially when human food was abundant and natural food was scarce. These results partially support the hypothesis that long-tailed macaques choose their sleeping sites to avoid predation; proximity to human settlements appears to be the primary factor influencing sleeping site choice in this primate species. Our results reflect the strong influence that anthropic factors have on primates, which subsist in increasingly human-dominated landscapes. Am. J. Primatol. 76:1140-1150, 2014.

Why do some individuals show maladaptive behaviours, while others show adaptive responses to evolutionarily novel situations? At present, we lack a unified conceptual framework for generating predictions and guiding empirical and theoretical work on this critical question. Drawing from the concept of ecological traps, I suggest that a conceptual framework for explaining this variation should include four main points: (1) behavioural responses (adaptive or not) are the result of cueeresponse systems, or behavioural 'rules of thumb'; (2) limited or imprecise, unreliable information often underlies suboptimal behaviour; (3) the organism's behavioural flexibility affects its response to novel situations; and (4) evolution (and development) in past environments has shaped cueeresponse systems, responses to imperfect information and degree of behavioural flexibility to be adaptive in past environments, but not necessarily in novel environments. The degree of match/mismatch between past environments and novel environments altered by HIREC is thus a key to explaining adaptive versus maladaptive behaviours. I suggest several existing frameworks that address these four points, and are thus potentially useful for explaining behavioural responses to HIREC: signal detection theory, adaptive plasticity theory, extended reaction norms and cost-benefit theory on variation in learning. I further discuss more complex aspects of reality that would be useful to add to these existing frameworks. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, prey should be able to assess their own vulnerability to predation and modify their antipredatory behavior accordingly. When approached by predator skuas, unguarded penguin chicks flee short distances, and usually aggregate in dense packs, but there is a clear interindividual variability in their responses under similar conditions. We hypothesized that this variability in escape responses might be related to the perceived vulnerability to predation of each individual chick. We simulated predator attacks to chinstrap penguin chicks and analyzed the sources of variation in their escape response, such as the presence of adults or the density of other chicks, and the sex, age, body condition, and health status of responding chicks. Chicks allowed shorter approach distances when they had a better health condition (i.e., a greater T-cell-mediated immunity, CMI), when they were younger, and when the density of adults around was higher. Sex and density of other chicks were not important. Similarly, chicks fled from the experimenter to longer distances when they had a lower CMI and when the density of adults was lower. Therefore, escape characteristics of chicks depended on the presence of adults that can deter predators and on the health-dependent vulnerability of chicks.","CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim & Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,"Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",Jose.Martin@mncn.csic.es,"Fargallo, Juan A/I-5585-2015; Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; De Neve, Liesbeth/F-7896-2011","Fargallo, Juan A/0000-0003-4090-9000; Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; De Neve, Liesbeth/0000-0003-0041-9824; Vicente, Polo/0000-0002-0994-5372",,,,58,28,29,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Predation can influence patterns of browse through decreasing White-tailed Deer abundance and influencing patterns of habitat selection. Canis latrans (Coyote) is the dominant predator of White-tailed Deer in our focal region in northern New York. Optimal foraging theory suggests that White-tailed Deer browse in locations that maximize energy intake while minimizing predation risk. Linear forest edges provide abundant woody browse for White-tailed Deer, but are also used as travel-ways by Coyotes in our focal region. These locations therefore provide a venue for testing the extent to which predation risk influences patterns of White-tailed Deer browsing. We quantified White-tailed Deer browse use for edge and interior sites and the density of Coyote scats along seventeen 500-m transects to evaluate the scale at which White-tailed Deer herbivory was affected by Coyote predation risk. We did not observe a change in White-tailed Deer browsing at the landscape scale in response to variation in the risk of Coyote predation, or a mitigating role of escape cover. However, we did detect a tendency for White-tailed Deer to shift browsing from the forest edge to interior along transects with more Coyotes. Our study indicates that Coyotes in the focal area were likely influencing patterns of browsing primarily through behaviorally mediated indirect effects.","[Pierce, Joshua L.

However, people can also perceive smaller species of carnivores as threatening, particularly in urban areas. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) started to colonize British cities in the 1930s, and there is growing public concern about foxes biting people, particularly babies. These events are generally described in the press as attacks and generate intense media coverage and speculation that foxes view human infants as potential prey. Because foxes rely primarily on auditory cues for hunting, we conducted acoustic playback experiments in the gardens of 15 residential houses in northwest Bristol, United Kingdom, in December 2015 and 11 gardens from May to June 2016 to determine whether urban foxes were attracted to infant distress calls (cries). Foxes were not more likely to be attracted to infant cries or laughs than silence, although a minority of foxes cautiously approached and contacted the source of both types of infant vocalization. Their behavior appeared to be investigative rather than aggressive or predatory. Our review of the incidents reported in the British media showed that most people were bitten or scratched while sleeping, and adults were more likely to be bitten than children. The nature of the interactions and the wounds inflicted suggest that the foxes were using their mouth or forefeet to investigate an unusual object. Most incidents occurred inside people's homes, even though it is unusual for foxes to enter houses. The data suggested that incidents where people were bitten were chance events, possibly involving a particularly bold fox. To minimize the risk to the public, more quantitative data are required on the age, social status, and health of the foxes that enter houses and those that bite people.","[Bridge, Bethany; Harris, Stephen] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England",,"Harris, S (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",s.harris16@talktalk.net,,,,,,87,1,1,5,11,JACK H BERRYMAN INST,LOGAN,"UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT WILDLAND RESOURCES, LOGAN, UTAH 84322-5230 USA",1934-4392,1936-8046,,HUM-WILDL INTERACT,Hum.-Wildl.

Human interests often conflict with those of wildlife. In the coastal zone humans often exploit shellfish populations that would otherwise provide food for populations of shorebirds (Charadrii). There has been considerable debate on the consequences of shellfishing for the survival of shorebirds, and conversely the effects of shorebird predation on the shellfish stocks remaining for human exploitation. Until now, it has been difficult to determine the impact of current shellfishery practices on birds or to investigate how possible alternative policies would affect their survival and numbers. 2. One long-running contentious issue has been how to manage mussel Mytilus edulis and cockle Cerastoderma edule shellfisheries in a way that has least effect on a co-dependent shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, which also consumes these shellfish. This study used a behaviour-based model to explore the effects that the present-day management regimes of a mussel (Exe estuary, UK) and a cockle (Burry inlet, UK) fishery have on the survival and numbers of overwintering oystercatchers. It also explored how alternative regimes might affect the birds. 3. The model includes depletion and disturbance as two possibly detrimental effects of shellfishing and some of the longer-term effects on shellfish stocks. Importantly, model birds respond to shellfishing in the same ways as real birds. They increase the time spent feeding at low tide and feed in fields and upshore areas at other times. When shellfishing removes the larger prey, birds eat more smaller prey. 4. The results suggest that, currently, neither shellfishery causes oystercatcher mortality to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of shellfishing; at present intensities, shellfishing does not significantly affect the birds. However, they also show that changes in management practices, such as increasing fishing effort, reducing the minimum size of shellfish collected or increasing the daily quota, can greatly affect oystercatcher mortality and population size, and that the detrimental effect of shellfishing can be greatly increased by periods of cold weather or when prey are unusually scarce. By providing quantitative predictions of bird survival and numbers of a range of alternative shellfishery management regimes, the model can guide management policy in these and other estuaries.","Ctr Ecol & Hydrol Dorset, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England; Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England; Royal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England; Alterra, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; SMACOPI, RN Baie de Somme, F-80100 Abbeville, France",,"Stillman, RA (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol Dorset, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Winfrith Newburgh, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England.",,"Stillman, Richard/B-6018-2009; van der Meer, Jaap/C-6687-2011",,,,,30,80,84,0,23,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Vultures exhibit complex behaviors and can adapt to any human-dominated landscape or land use. These traits, combined with population growth and range expansion, have contributed to increased human-vulture conflicts. Our goal was to summarize the current status and trends in human-black vulture conflicts (hereafter human-vulture conflicts), review available management strategies, identify knowledge gaps, and provide recommendations to enhance management and understanding of this species and the associated conflicts. We found human-vulture conflicts are increasing in agriculture (livestock), private and public property (both personal and infrastructure-based), and threats to human health and safety. The greatest increases in conflicts were reported in agriculture and private and public property damage. Regarding livestock depredation, good progress has been made toward assessing producer perceptions of the conflicts, including estimates of economic damage and mitigation strategies, but a basic understanding of the underlying mechanism driving the conflict and advancing strategies to mitigate damage is lacking. For damaged property, little information is available regarding economic losses and perceptions of stakeholders who are experiencing the damage, and most of the tools recommended for mitigating this damage have not been rigorously evaluated. Regarding human health and safety, recent research quantifying flight behavior of black vultures has direct implications for reducing aircraft collision risks. However, it is unclear what factors influence roost site selection and the most effective means to leverage the sensory ecology of the species to mitigate risks. We identify additional knowledge gaps and research needs that if addressed could increase managers' understanding of black vulture ecology and facilitate enhanced management of this species while simultaneously allowing for the species to provide valuable ecosystem services.","[Kluever, Bryan M.] Wildlife Serv, USDA, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Florida Field Stn, 2820 East Univ Ave, Gainesville, FL 32641 USA; [Pfeiffer, Morgan B.] Wildlife Serv, USDA, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ohio Field Stn, 6100 Columbus Ave, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA; [Pfeiffer, Morgan B.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus, George, South Africa; [Barras, Scott C.] Wildlife Serv, USDA, Virginia State Program, POB 130, Mosely, VA 23120 USA; [Dunlap, Brett G.] Wildlife Serv, USDA, Tennessee Kentucky State Program, 537 Myatt Dr, Madison, TN 37115 USA; [Humberg, Lee A.] Wildlife Serv, USDA, Indiana State Program, 901 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Kluever, BM (corresponding author), Wildlife Serv, USDA, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Florida Field Stn, 2820 East Univ Ave, Gainesville, FL 32641 USA.",bryan.kluever@usda.gov,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Wildlife Research Center; U.S. Federal Aviation Administration [692M15-19-T-00017, 692M15-19F-00348]","The findings and conclusions in this publication have not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy.

Previous work has indicated that individuals located at the edge of groups have higher domains of danger, thus are more likely to engage in vigilance or antipredator behavior. We studied the determinants of vigilance behavior in two groups of ring-tailed coatis in Iguazu National Park, Argentina. In addition to the expected pattern that coatis were more vigilant at the edge of the group, we found that individuals were particularly vigilant at the front edge of the group. This pattern conforms to predictions of differing predation risk caused by sit-and-wait predators with respect to mobile animal groups. In addition, coatis exhibited less vigilance when the number of neighbors within 5 m and group size increased. Of the three spatial variables tested, within-group spatial position was the most important predictor variable determining vigilance levels. These results confirm that spatial position has major effects on vigilance behavior, and that group directionality is an important factor which should be taken into account when measuring vigilance behavior. Coatis were more vigilant when juveniles less than 6 months old were in the groups. The presence of these young juveniles also affected the relationship between alarm response and vigilance levels. Coatis were more vigilant after strong alarm reactions, but only when young juveniles were not present in the groups. This may indicate that coatis give differential responses to alarm calls depending on the age of the caller. A comparison of antipredator vigilance between coatis and sympatric capuchin monkeys is consistent with the hypothesis that terrestriality leads to higher perceive predation risk for coatis.","SUNY Stony Brook, Interdept Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; Univ Nacl San Luis, Dept Biol, San Luis, Argentina",,"Hirsch, BT (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Interdept Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",bthirsch@ic.sunysb.edu,,"hirsch, ben/0000-0003-0142-7340",,,,48,54,54,2,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We found that 53% of cat owning respondents do not allow any roaming. These respondents were more likely to hold concerns about risks to cats' safety while roaming and less likely to perceive that cats have a right to roam. Concern about impacts to wildlife was not a significant predictor of containment behavior. Expectations that cat owners should manage cats' roaming behavior was a social norm among cat owners and other respondents, and cat containers were more likely to indicate that they would try to change behaviors of their peers that they perceived to be harmful to the environment. Cat containment campaigns could be improved by appealing to owners' concerns about cat well-being, engaging respected messengers that align with these concerns, including owners who already contain their cats.","[van Eeden, Lily M.; Hames, Fern; Faulkner, Richard; Geschke, Andrew; Squires, Zoe E.] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia; [van Eeden, Lily M.] RMIT Univ, ICON Sci Res Grp, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [van Eeden, Lily M.] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, BehaviourWorks Australia, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [McLeod, Emily M.] Zoos Victoria, Dept Wildlife Conservat & Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia",,"van Eeden, LM (corresponding author), Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, 123 Brown St, Heidelberg, Vic 3188, Australia.",lily.vaneeden@delwp.vic.gov.au,,"Squires, Zoe/0000-0002-3878-6753","Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning as part of the Victorians Value Nature program","Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning as part of the Victorians Value Nature program",,59,2,2,4,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,2578-4854,,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

The early larva of Parnassius apollo is uniformly black, but the later instars develop two rows of dorsal orange spots. We tested the effect of these orange markings on the conspicuousness of the last-instar larva, by manipulating larval coloration in photographs from a natural habitat and measuring how fast human subjects could discover the larva on a touch screen. In the first experiment we compared the detectability of the natural phenotype with that of manipulated uniformly black and uniformly orange variants at different distances. In the second experiment with another set of photographs we added manipulations involving enlarged and reduced spot sizes. Generally, detection time increased with distance, and decreased with the proportion of orange in the coloration. The uniformly black larvae were surprisingly hard to detect even at the closest distances, suggesting that the young black instar has an efficient camou. age. Furthermore, even a small amount of orange colour increased the conspicuousness of the larva considerably, indicating that the orange markings are costly in terms of detectability. Importantly, as the increase in detection time over distances was larger for the natural coloration than for the orange coloration, we suggest that the natural coloration may involve a distance-dependent switch from conspicuousness to camou. age with increasing distance. Thus, even though the orange markings most probably have a signalling function, the coloration is not maximized for either crypsis or conspicuousness.

Primary measures taken before, during and after predator confrontation comprise escape attempts, predator assessment, defensive attack and flight. Previous reports from this laboratory have shown that the panic-promoting drug yohimbine potentiated flight behavior, while long-term treatment with the panicolytic agent alprazolam reduced this response. In order to evaluate further the possibility that the MDTB may represent an effective animal model of panic attacks, the present study investigated the behavioral effect of imipramine and fluoxetine, two serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) known to alleviate panic symptoms when given on a repeated basis. Both drugs were administered acutely and chronically (one daily IP injection for 21 days) at 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. Our results showed that a single dose of imipramine or fluoxetine strongly potentiated flight reactions in response to an approaching predator and increased defensive attack toward the rat. This was in contrast to chronic treatment with each drug which dramatically decreased flight responses and defensive attack behaviors. In addition, long-term administration with both SRIs produced a reliable attenuation of predator assessment activities. Taken together, these findings suggest an acute anxiogenic-like effect of imipramine and fluoxetine followed by a fear/anxiety reducing effect after repeated administrations. These results support clinical observations revealing an acute anxiogenic effect of SRIs followed by an anxiolytic and/or panicolytic effect after chronic use, and support previous results suggesting that the MDTB may be useful for the investigation of panic-modulating agents.","UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,BEKESY LAB NEUROBIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & REPROD BIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT PSYCHOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822",,"GRIEBEL, G (corresponding author), SYNTHELABO RECH LERS,CNR PHARMACOL GRP,31 AVE PAUL VAILLANT COUTURIER,F-92220 BAGNEUX,FRANCE.",,"Griebel, Guy/F-8752-2014","Griebel, Guy/0000-0002-6052-9438",NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [GM08125] Funding Source: Medline; PHS HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service [RP03061] Funding Source: Medline,,,59,104,105,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JUL,1995,120,1,,,,,57,66,,10.1007/BF02246145,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,RJ237,WOS:A1995RJ23700007,7480536,,,,2022-04-19,

However, it is unclear how chemically diverse kairomones can elicit similar avoidance behaviors. Using a combination of behavioral analyses and single-cell Ca2+ imaging in wild-type and gene-targeted mice, we show that innate predator-evoked avoidance is driven by parallel, non-redundant processing of volatile and nonvolatile kairomones through the activation of multiple olfactory subsystems including the Grueneberg ganglion, the vomeronasal organ, and chemosensory neurons within the main olfactory epithelium. Perturbation of chemosensory responses in specific subsystems through disruption of genes encoding key sensory transduction proteins (Cnga3, Gnao1) or by surgical axotomy abolished avoidance behaviors and/or cellular Ca2+ responses to different predator odors. Stimulation of these different subsystems resulted in the activation of widely distributed target regions in the olfactory bulb, as assessed by c-Fos expression. However, in each case, this c-Fos increase was observed within thesame subnuclei of the medial amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamus, regions implicated in fear, anxiety, and defensive behaviors. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system has evolved multiple, parallel mechanisms for kairomone detection that converge in the brain to facilitate a common behavioral response. Our findings provide significant insights into the genetic substrates and circuit logic of predator-driven innate aversion and may serve as a valuable model for studying instinctive fear [1] and human emotional and panic disorders [2, 3].","[Perez-Gomez, Anabel; Bleymehl, Katherin; Stein, Benjamin; Pyrski, Martina; Leinders-Zufall, Trese; Zufall, Frank; Chamero, Pablo] Univ Saarland, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, D-66421 Homburg, Germany; [Perez-Gomez, Anabel; Bleymehl, Katherin; Stein, Benjamin; Pyrski, Martina; Leinders-Zufall, Trese; Zufall, Frank; Chamero, Pablo] Univ Saarland, Sch Med, Ctr Integrat Physiol & Mol Med, D-66421 Homburg, Germany; [Birnbaumer, Lutz] NIEHS, Neurobiol Lab, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Munger, Steven D.] Univ Florida, Dept Med, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Munger, Steven D.] Univ Florida, Ctr Smell & Taste, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",,"Zufall, F (corresponding author), Univ Saarland, Sch Med, Dept Physiol, D-66421 Homburg, Germany.",frank.zufall@uks.eu,"Leinders-Zufall, Trese/S-3664-2019; Leinders-Zufall, Trese/B-4103-2009; Zufall, Frank/AAE-5290-2021","Leinders-Zufall, Trese/0000-0002-0678-362X; Leinders-Zufall, Trese/0000-0002-0678-362X; Zufall, Frank/0000-0002-4383-8618; Pyrski, Martina/0000-0002-5751-178X; Chamero, Pablo/0000-0002-4305-1073",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CH 920/2-1]; International Graduate School [GK 1326]; National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication DisordersUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [DC005633]; University of Saarland HOMFORexzellent grant; Intramural Research Program of the NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [Z01 ES-101643]; Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen;  [Sonderforschungsbereich 894]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [Z01ES101643] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01DC005633] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"All animal care and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with guidelines established by the animal welfare committee of the University of Saarland.

Among ungulates, studies of partially migratory populations have allowed researchers to compare and contrast performance metrics of migrants versus residents and examine how environmental factors influence the relative abundance of each. Such studies tend to characterize animals discretely as either migratory or resident, but we suggest that variable migration distances within migratory herds are an important and overlooked form of population structure, with potential consequences for animal fitness. We examined whether the variation in individual migration distances (20-264 km) within a single wintering population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) was associated with several critical behavioral attributes of migration, including timing of migration, time allocation to seasonal ranges, and exposure to anthropogenic mortality risks. Both the timing of migration and the amount of time animals allocated to seasonal ranges varied with migration distance. Animals migrating long distances (150-250 km) initiated spring migration more than three weeks before than those migrating moderate (50-150 km) or short distances (< 50 km). Across an entire year, long-distance migrants spent approximately 100 more days migrating compared to moderate-and short-distance migrants. Relatedly, winter residency of long-distance migrants was 71 d fewer than for animals migrating shorter distances. Exposure to anthropogenic mortality factors, including highways and fences, was high for long-distance migrants, whereas vulnerability to harvest was high for short-and moderate-distance migrants. By reducing the amount of time that animals spend on winter range, long-distance migration may alleviate intraspecific competition for limited forage and effectively increase carrying capacity. Clear differences in winter residency, migration duration, and risk of anthropogenic mortality among short-, moderate-, and long-distance migrants suggest fitness trade-offs may exist among migratory segments of the population. Future studies of partial migration may benefit from expanding comparisons of residents and migrants, to consider how variable migration distances of migrants may influence the costs and benefits of migration.","[Sawyer, Hall] Western Ecosyst Technol Inc, 200 South 2nd St, Laramie, WY 82070 USA; [Middleton, Arthur D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Hilgard Way, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hayes, Matthew M.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Kauffman, Matthew J.; Monteith, Kevin L.] Univ Wyoming, US Geol Survey, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Monteith, Kevin L.] Univ Wyoming, Haub Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",,"Sawyer, H (corresponding author), Western Ecosyst Technol Inc, 200 South 2nd St, Laramie, WY 82070 USA.",hsawyer@west-inc.com,,"Sawyer, Hall/0000-0002-3789-7558",Rock Springs Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management,"We thank Patrick Burke, Dean Clause, Therese Hartman, Rusty Kaiser, Lorraine Keith, Mark Snyder, Mark Thonhoff, and Mark Zornes for logistical support.

We tested the hypotheses that individual Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) vary consistently in their response to predators, a temperament trait, and that this individual variation is associated with breeding-site selection. Specifically, we tested whether measures of behavioral response to human approaches are associated with either patch area or patch openness and thus to area sensitivity. We made two to seven sequential approaches to Bobolinks in 2009 and 2010, measuring starting distance, flight-initiation distance, and the distance from the observers to where the birds landed. We analyzed the data with repeatability estimates and linear mixed modeling. Flight-initiation distance was repeatable when starting distance was controlled for, but distance to landing was not after starting distance and flight-initiation distance were controlled for. We found no strong effect of area or openness on either flight-initiation distance or distance to landing. We conclude that this measure of response to predators shows individual variation, but this variation does not explain patterns of settlement among habitat patches. Because flight-initiation distance is often used to identify distances at which human behavior disrupts wildlife, we estimate its mean (21.8 m) and the distance at which 75%, 95%, and 99% of the Bobolinks flushed (28, 40, and 59 m, respectively).","[Keyel, Alexander C.; Peck, David T.; Reed, J.

Using data from the literature, we grouped the nest defense behaviors of 19 diurnal North American raptors into four categories based on a gradient of aggressiveness. For each species, we identified the cover types where nesting occurred, accessibility of nest location, assessed two indices of reproductive effort, and examined associations between these factors and nest-defense behavior. We also we examined responses by raptor species to different predator types including diurnal avian, nocturnal avian, mammalian (not human), and human. Most raptor species with high reproductive effort exhibited very aggressive nest defense. Most raptor species nesting in open cover types and species with accessible nests showed aggressive nest defense. While many raptors react aggressively toward diurnal and nocturnal avian predators, they exhibit less aggressive defense against potential human predators. Results from this study suggest that a variety of factors may influence nest-defense strategies used by diurnal raptors. However, more work is needed on the relative influence of these factors (including predation risk) and variation in raptor nest defense strategies before general patterns can be elucidated.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Fishery & Wildlife Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Morrison, JL (corresponding author), Trinity Coll, Dept Biol, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.",joan.morrison@trincoll.edu,"Kennedy, Patricia L/I-4902-2015","Kennedy, Patricia L/0000-0002-2090-1821",,,,123,12,13,1,41,RAPTOR RESEARCH FOUNDATION INC,HASTINGS,"14377 117TH STREET SOUTH, HASTINGS, MN 55033 USA",0892-1016,2162-4569,,J RAPTOR RES,J.

For example, mortality risk may be affected by the road infrastructure associated with energy development by influencing space use of predators including human hunters. To assess these relationships, we conducted research on northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus across a hunted and non-hunted area of Beaver River Wildlife Management Area, Oklahoma, using radiotelemetry from 2012-2015. We found that bobwhite mortality risk decreased as the distance from primary roads (m) increased across weeks (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.008, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0003 to 1.0013). The interaction between unit (hunted and non-hunted) and distance from primary roads was not significant (HR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.999 to 1.001) indicating that hunting pressure was not a likely explanation for the observed decrease in survival related to primary roads. Bobwhite on the hunted unit avoided exposed soil/sparse vegetation ((beta) over bar = -0.01, CI = -0.02 to -0.002) and bare ground ((beta) over bar = -0.01, CI = -0.02 to -0.002) more than bobwhite on the non-hunted unit, however these were weak relationships. No other differences in bobwhite space use were detected related to hunting. Though we were limited to estimating theoretical rather than empirical amounts of hunting pressure during our study, we were unable to detect any negative compounding effects of anthropogenic development and hunting pressure on bobwhite ecology during the hunting season.","[Tanner, Evan P.; Elmore, R.

It is generally assumed that, in the absence of direct visual contact, such species are less vulnerable to disturbance. Seabird colonies can support large populations of burrow- and cavity-nesting species and attract increasing numbers of tourists. We investigated the potential effects of recreational disturbance on the reproductive behaviour of the European storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus, a nocturnally-active cavity-nesting seabird. Reproductive phenology and outcome of nests subject to high and low levels of visitor pressure were recorded in two consecutive years. Hatching success did not differ between disturbance levels, but overall nestling mortality was significantly higher in areas exposed to high visitor pressure. Although visitor numbers were consistent throughout the season, the magnitude and rate of a seasonal decline in productivity were significantly greater in nests subject to high disturbance. This study presents good evidence that, even when humans do not pose a direct mortality risk, animals may perceive them as a predation risk. This has implications for the conservation and management of a diverse range of burrow- and cavity-dwelling animals. Despite this reduction in individual fitness, overall colony productivity was reduced by <= 1.6% compared with that expected in the absence of visitors. While the colony-level consequences at the site in question may be considered minor, conservation managers must evaluate the trade-off between potential costs and benefits of public access on a site- and species-specific basis.

We recorded vertical and horizontal patterns of occupancy for 47 sleeping and 31 resting sites, as well as the presence of lianas or vines on trees. We compared the heights of trees used as resting or sleeping sites by the monkeys with those of 200 forest trees that the monkeys did not use. Trees used as nocturnal sleeping sites were taller than those used as diurnal resting sites, and taller than trees that the monkeys did not use. However, while trees used as diurnal resting sites were not significantly taller than non-used trees, diurnal resting sites were located on branches closer to the ground, closer to the main trunk of the tree and in trees with more lianas/vines than nocturnal sleeping sites. The differences in site location can be explained by the type of predator most likely to attack at a particular time: raptors in the day and felids at night.","[Juca, Thays; Cavalcante, Thiago; Barnett, Adrian A.] Natl Inst Amazonian Res INPA, Amazonian Mammals Res Grp, BR-69067001 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Boyle, Sarah] Rhodes Coll, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 31270 USA; [Cavalcanti, Gitana] Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Ecol Conservat & Wildlife Management, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Tomanek, Pavel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Anim Sci & Ethol, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Clemente, Salatiel] Fed Univ Acre UFAC, Ecol & Nat Resource Management, BR-69920900 Acre, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Tadeu] Maranhao State Univ UEMA, Dept Biol, BR-65080805 Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil; [Barnett, Adrian A.] Amazonas Fed Univ UFAM, Zool Dept, BR-69077000 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Barnett, Adrian A.] Univ Roehampton, Ctr Res Evolutionary Anthropol, London SW15 5PJ, England; [Barnett, Adrian A.] Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Zool, BR-50670420 Recife, PE, Brazil",,"Barnett, AA (corresponding author), Natl Inst Amazonian Res INPA, Amazonian Mammals Res Grp, BR-69067001 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.; Barnett, AA (corresponding author), Amazonas Fed Univ UFAM, Zool Dept, BR-69077000 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.; Barnett, AA (corresponding author), Univ Roehampton, Ctr Res Evolutionary Anthropol, London SW15 5PJ, England.; Barnett, AA (corresponding author), Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Zool, BR-50670420 Recife, PE, Brazil.",adrian.barnett1.biology@gmail.com,"Boyle, Sarah/AAQ-6815-2021",,"MSc ecology program; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus, Brazil; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnlogico-CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [131785/2017-6]; CNEC/WorleyParsons; ELETROBRAS","T.J. thanks the staff of the MSc ecology program, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus, Brazil, and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnlogico-CNPq) for financial support during the period in which this paper was written (Grant 131785/2017-6).

Although the function of pursuit-deterrent signaling is to dissuade predators from attack, relatively little is known about relationships between specific components of escape and the signaling behavior. I studied effects of the risk factor distance from refuge on flight initiation distance, distance fled, probability of entering refuge, and the distance between predator (an approaching human) and prey when pursuit-deterrent display begins (display distance) in the Cuban curly-tailed lizard (Leiocephalus carinatus). I also investigated whether starting distance (distance between predator and prey when approach begins) affects escape behaviors. As predicted by escape theory, flight initiation distance and distance fled were greater and refuge entry was less probable at greater distance from refuge, indicating that qualitative predictions of escape theory apply to pursuit deterrent signalers. Starting distance did Dot affect escape behaviors, presumably because it did not affect perceived risk, but might do so at a faster approach speed. Display distance and flight initiation distance were identical in the data set analyzed, but individuals sometimes perform tail displays prior to fleeing. Interspecific variation in the timing of pursuit-deterrent displays is discussed, as are possible reasons for observed differences in the effect of starting distance.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA",,"Cooper, WE (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA.",cooperw@ipfw.edu,,,,,,42,32,32,2,13,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,EMPORIA,"EMPORIA STATE UNIV, DIVISION BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1200 COMMERCIAL ST, EMPORIA, KS 66801-5087 USA",0018-0831,,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,JUN,2007,63,2,,,,,144,150,,10.1655/0018-0831(2007)63[144:EAIRTP]2.0.CO;2,,,7,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,169YP,WOS:000246628300003,,,,,2022-04-19,

We used covariates for vegetation, topography, disturbances by other ungulates, and disturbance by humans to develop movement, forage and bed site resource-selection models. We used an information-theoretic approach to select the top 5 models for movement, forage and bed site occurrences respectively. The three most parsimonious autologistic models were good predictors of movement, forage and bed occurrence of this species. Vegetation covariates were important components of all models. We recorded avoidance responses by the behaviours of species to each disturbance type (ie, villages, forest roads and abandoned roads); bed site occurrences were most sensitive to all human disturbances for their lowest odds encountered. Across all parsimonious models, villages have the largest negative effect on movement, foraging and bed occurrences. Movement and bedding behaviours were also affected by other ungulate disturbances. Altitude had slightly negative effect on movement and foraging behaviours. Ridges, topographic aspect and shrub stands were all correlated with bed-site selection. Although different behaviours may be associated with different microhabitat features, behaviours of red deer responded similarly to the same human disturbance on a broad scale. Based on the observations above, we believe that red deer are avoiding human-altered habitat for movement, bedding and foraging because of disturbances during the critical late winter period. Furthermore, various behavioural resource selection models and corresponding graphs of important habitat disturbances can be used to guide and evaluate future development proposals.","NE Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resources, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, MH (corresponding author), NE Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resources, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",zhangminghai2004@126.com,,"Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489",,,,66,17,17,1,38,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0001-7051,2190-3743,,ACTA THERIOL,Acta Theriol.,OCT,2007,52,4,,,,,435,446,,10.1007/BF03194241,,,12,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,222PO,WOS:000250309600011,,,,,2022-04-19,

This study reveals that boldness explains how vigilant chipmunks behave in response to alarm calls, and that vigilance diminishes in response to shyer callers. Chipmunks thus evaluate the personality of callers and discount the danger associated with calls from highly risk-sensitive individuals. Adjusting responsiveness relative to caller reliability improves foraging while reducing the risk of predation.Costly reproductive competition among females is predicted to lead to strategies that reduce these costs, such as reproductive schedules. Simultaneous births of coresident women in human families can reduce their infant survival, but whether such competition also affects overall birth rates and whether females time their pregnancies to avoid simultaneous births remain unknown, despite being key questions for understanding how intrafemale competition affects reproductive strategies. Here, we used detailed parish registers to study female reproductive competition in historical Finnish joint-families, where brothers stayed on their natal farms and sisters married out, and consequently unrelated daughters-in-law often coresided and competed for household resources. We quantified the time-varying effects of having reproductive-aged competitor(s) on a woman's interval from marriage to first childbirth, on age-specific fertility, and on birth scheduling. Contrary to our hypothesis, the presence of one or several potential female competitors did not lead to longer first birth intervals or lower age-specific probability of reproduction. We also found no evidence that women would schedule their reproduction to avoid the real cost of simultaneous births on their offspring mortality risk; age-specific reproductive rates were unaltered by changes in the presence of other infants in the household. These results raise interesting questions regarding the evolution of fertility suppression in social mammals in different contexts, the costs and benefits of extended families for female reproductive success and strategies deployed, and the cultural practices that may help to avoid the negative outcomes of female reproductive competition in human families.","[Pettay, Jenni E.; Lahdenpera, Mirkka; Lummaa, Virpi] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Vesilinnantie 5, Turku 20014, Finland; [Rotkirch, Anna] Populat Res Inst, Kalevankatu 16,PL 849, Helsinki 00101, Finland",,"Pettay, JE (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Vesilinnantie 5, Turku 20014, Finland.",jenni.pettay@utu.fi,,"Pettay, Jenni/0000-0002-7768-5883; Lahdenpera, Mirkka/0000-0003-0062-6284","Kone Foundation; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [294360, 266898]","This work was supported by grants from the Kone Foundation (J.P, M.L.) and the Academy of Finland (V.L. 294360, AR 266898).; We are grateful for the Karelian database, Sinikka Toijonen and Jarmo Piippo for data collection.

I used the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda, Furnariidae), acavity-nesting species endemic to the temperate rainforest of southern South America, as a model species to determine if territory use and nest-tree selection, and associated consequences for fitness, varied spatially in response to human-driven habitat changes. I established two 10 ha plots in each of three forest habitats that differed in structure and isolation: connected old-growth forest, connected logged forest, and isolated logged fragments. Characteristics of trees used for nesting varied among forest types, but nest success did not. In connected forests (old-growth and logged forest), snags were used more often than expected based on their availability. Nest survival models identified type of tree (snag vs. live tree) and epiphyte cover of trees as the variables with the strongest effects on daily nest survival. Nests in snags and with less epiphyte cover were more successful than nests in live trees. These results support an adaptive nest-site choice in this species. In isolated logged fragments, use of nest trees was proportional to availability, with smaller trees and different tree species used for nesting, suggesting behavioral plasticity in nest-site selection. Territories were similar among forest types and were characterized by a dense understory and more large trees and snags than unused areas. This study provides evidence for consistent territory use but spatially variable nest-tree selection in response to ecological gradients produced by human activities.","[Cornelius, Cintia] Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Cornelius, Cintia] Fdn Senda Darwin, Santiago, Chile",,"Cornelius, C (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol Paisagem & Conservacao, Inst Biociencias, Rua Matao,Trav 14,321, BR-05850900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",cintia.cornelius@gmail.com,,"Cornelius, Cintia/0000-0002-6690-7655","Wildlife Conservation Society Fellowship; National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF); International Center for Tropical Ecology at UMSL; St. Louis Audubon Society; Webster Grove Nature Studies Society, Sigma X i; Idea Wild; Universidad Catolica de Chile and Senda Darwin Biological Station; Compton Foundation; University of Missouri-St. Louis Graduate School (Dissertation Year Fellowship); UMSL; Senda Darwin Biological Station","This study would not have been possible without the hard work of several field assistants: H.

Resource selection functions (RSF) have contributed to the conservation of species negatively affected by human activities. Despite these applications, two assumptions frequent many studies: the assumption of independence among groups in social species, and that selection is proportional to resource availability. This latter case is known as a functional response in resource selection, and may be especially important in human-wildlife relationships where there is a fitness cost of proximity to humans. 2. Recent advances in generalized linear mixed models offer new ways to account for resource selection in social species and functional responses by accommodating correlations within hierarchical groups with random intercepts, and functional responses with random coefficients. 3. We illustrate the application of mixed-effects RSF models using a case study of resource selection by individual wolves Canis lupus living in packs as a function of human activity. 4. In areas of low human activity, wolf resource selection was independent of proximity to humans. As human activity increased, wolves displayed a functional response selecting areas closer to human activity. With increasing human activity, however, wolves displayed spatio-temporal avoidance of human activity during daylight. This could lead to behaviourally induced trophic cascades mediated by wolf avoidance of human activity, and fits within the framework of attractive sink habitats. 5. Accounting for the hierarchical social structure of wolves clearly showed that the response of wolves to human disturbance was strongly correlated, but different, within packs, and that the correlation was strongest during winter and weakest during summer. 6. Syntheses and applications. Failure to consider the social structure of wolves and the functional response to human activity would result in mistaken conclusions about wolf-human relationships. Our approach provides a unifying framework to understand the contradictory results of previous studies of wolf-human relationships and a template for future studies to evaluate effects of increasing human activity on wildlife.","[Hebblewhite, Mark; Merrill, Evelyn] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada",,"Hebblewhite, M (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conversat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",mark.hebblewhite@cfc.umt.edu,"Hebblewhite, Mark/AAI-8101-2020; hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013; Merrill, Evelyn/N-5801-2015","Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361; Merrill, Evelyn/0000-0001-7737-958X",,,,51,259,261,5,168,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The field of robotics has the potential to accelerate progress along this path, by offering unprecedented means for the design and development of accurate and reliable experimental stimuli. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, the integration of robotic predators in place conditioning experiments. We hypothesized zebrafish to be capable of forming a spatial association under a simulated predation risk. We repeatedly exposed experimental subjects to a robotic heron impacting the water surface and then evaluated their spatial avoidance within the experimental tank in a subsequent predator-free test session. To pharmacologically validate the paradigm, we tested zebrafish in drugfree conditions (control groups) or in response to three different concentrations of citalopram (30, 50, and 100 mg/L) and ethanol (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00%). Experimental data indicate that, when tested in the absence of the conditioning stimulus, zebrafish displayed a marked preference for the bottom of the test tank, that is, the farthest location from the simulated attacks by the robotic heron. This conditioned geotaxis was reduced by the administration of citalopram in a linear dose-response curve and ethanol at the low concentration. Ultimately, our data demonstrate that robotic stimuli may represent valid conditioning tools and, thereby, aid the field of zebrafish psychopharmacology.","[Clement, Romain J.

Remarkably, for diverse animal species, including humans, spontaneous patterns of waiting times show random 'burstiness' that appears scale-invariant across a broad set of scales. However, a general theory linking this phenomenon across the animal kingdom currently lacks an ecological basis. Here, we demonstrate from tracking the activities of 15 sympatric predator species (cephalopods, sharks, skates and teleosts) under natural and controlled conditions that bursty waiting times are an intrinsic spontaneous behaviour well approximated by heavy-tailed (power-law) models over data ranges up to four orders of magnitude. Scaling exponents quantifying ratios of frequent short to rare very long waits are species-specific, being determined by traits such as foragingmode (active versus ambush predation), body size and prey preference. A stochastic-deterministic decision model reproduced the empirical waiting time scaling and species-specific exponents, indicating that apparently complex scaling can emerge from simple decisions. Results indicate temporal power-law scaling is a behavioural 'rule of thumb' that is tuned to species' ecological traits, implying a common pattern may have naturally evolved that optimizes move-wait decisions in less predictable natural environments.","[Wearmouth, Victoria J.; McHugh, Matthew J.; Humphries, Nicolas E.; Naegelen, Aurore; Southall, Emily J.; Sims, David W.] Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Naegelen, Aurore] Univ Western Britanny, European Inst Marine Studies IUEM, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Ahmed, Mohammed Z.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Comp & Math, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Reynolds, Andrew M.] Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Sims, David W.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Sims, David W.] Univ Southampton, Ctr Biol Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",,"Sims, DW (corresponding author), Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England.",dws@mba.ac.uk,"Humphries, Nicolas/AAH-1666-2021; Humphries, Nick/AAE-7170-2019; Southall, Emily/AGP-5395-2022; McHugh, Matthew/AAC-3288-2020; Ahmed, Mohammed/T-5898-2019","Humphries, Nicolas/0000-0003-3741-1594; McHugh, Matthew/0000-0001-6210-0689; Sims, David/0000-0002-0916-7363; Southall, Emily/0000-0001-7246-278X",UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; Marine Biological Association (MBA) Senior Research FellowshipUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BBS/E/C/00005195] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BBS/E/C/00005195] Funding Source: researchfish,"Funding was provided by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Strategic Research Programme 'Oceans 2025' (Theme 6: Science for Sustainable Marine Resources), The Leverhulme Trust and a Marine Biological Association (MBA) Senior Research Fellowship (D.W.S).

Examining the factors that influence collective vigilance and exploring how individual vigilance is organized at the group level can help to understand how prey groups respond to potential threats. We quantified collective vigilance and determined its temporal pattern in a natural wintering population of the hooded crane Grus monacha in the Shengjin Lake reserve in China. We examined the role of flock size and anthropogenic disturbances in the human-dominated landscape on collective vigilance and level of synchronization. The proportion of time during which at least one individual scanned the surroundings (collective vigilance) increased with flock size and was higher in the more disturbed buffer zone of the lake. Synchronization of vigilance occurred more frequently in the smaller flocks but was not related to the risk of disturbance. Synchronization implies that individuals tend to monitor and copy the vigilance of neighbors. In the degraded wetlands, the wintering hooded crane benefits from foraging in groups and synchronizing their vigilance in response to human disturbances.","[Li, Chunlin; Wang, Zhen] Anhui Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, 111 Jiulong Rd, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Li, Chunlin] Anhui Biodivers Informat Ctr, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Beauchamp, Guy] Univ Montreal, Fac Vet Med, St Hyacinthe, PQ, Canada; [Cui, Peng] Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Minist Environm Protect, Nanjing, Peoples R China",,"Li, CL (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, 111 Jiulong Rd, Hefei, Peoples R China.",lichunlin1985@163.com,,,"National Natural Sciences Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31301897]; Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [20133401120014]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1308085QC64]; Natural Sciences Foundation of Education Department of Anhui Province [KJ2013A023]; Shengjin Lake National Nature Reserve Management Center","The study was supported by National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (31301897), the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (20133401120014), the Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (1308085QC64), and Natural Sciences Foundation of Education Department of Anhui Province (KJ2013A023).

In experiments, behaviors are often eliminated entirely, which allows demonstration that a behavior affects risk but makes it impossible to quantify effects of individual behaviors. In models, host behaviors have been studied using ordinary differential equations, which can be easily analyzed but cannot be used to relate individual behaviors to risk. For many insect baculoviruses, however, quantifying effects of behavior on risk is straightforward because transmission occurs when host larvae accidentally consume virus-contaminated foliage. Moreover, increases in computing power have made it possible to fit complex models to data. We therefore used experiments to quantify the behavior of gypsy moth larvae feeding on oak leaves contaminated with virus-infected cadavers, and we tested for effects of cadaver-avoidance behavior by fitting stochastic simulation models to our data. The models that best explain the data include cadaver avoidance, and comparison of models that do and do not include cadaver avoidance shows that this behavior substantially reduces infection risk. Our work demonstrates that host behaviors that affect exposure risk play a key role in baculovirus transmission and adds to the growing consensus that host behavior can strongly alter pathogen transmission rates.","[Eakin, Libby; Dwyer, Greg] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wang, Mei] Univ Chicago, Dept Stat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Dwyer, G (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",gdwyer@uchicago.edu,"Dwyer, Greg/L-1134-2015","Dwyer, Greg/0000-0002-7387-2075",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM096655]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM096655] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"L.E. thanks J.

Unconditioned defensive behaviors were assessed during threat exposure, while conditioned defensive behaviors were assessed in each predator context 24 h after the initial threat encounter. Pre-training infusions of the CRF(1) and CRF(2) receptor agonist oCRF significantly increased defensive behaviors during both the unconditioned and conditioned components of the cat odor test, as well as exposure to the EPM. In contrast to the behavioral effects of oCRF microinfusions, the CRF(1) and CRF(2) receptor antagonist [Glu(11,16)]Ast significantly decreased defensive behaviors during exposure to cat odor, while producing no discernible effects following a second injection in the cat exposure test. During conditioned test trials, pre-training infusions of [Glu(11,16)]Ast also significantly reduced defensive behaviors during re-exposure to both predator contexts. These results suggest a specific role for ventral hippocampal CRF receptors in modulating anxiety-like behaviors in several ethologically relevant animal models of defense. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A field experiment,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Behavior; Cyclope neritea; Human trampling; Sandy beach; Scavenger,CYCLOPE-NERITEA; BUCCINANOPS-GLOBULOSUM; TROPHIC FACILITATION; CARRION; NASSARIIDAE; RESPONSES; SUBSIDIES; TOURISM; HARBOR; SNAIL,"Carrion on beaches is an unpredictable and ephemeral resource over time, especially in areas affected by a tidal regime whereby the ground is frequently washed by incoming tides. In this ecosystem, economic activity, such as the commercial harvesting of molluscs, leads to the presence of discarded, damaged and dying specimens of bivalves on the sand. Thus, although carrion usually represents a minor food source on sandy beaches, human harvesting activity can lead to a significant contribution, this being majorly important for scavengers. During low tide, intertidal gastropod scavengers remain buried in the substrate and emerge when they detect carrion. However, in some instances these gastropods may also emerge in response to mechanical disturbance regardless of the presence of food. The study reported here aims at investigating the effect of human activity, such as trampling on sandy beaches during shellfish gathering, on the behavior of the gastropod scavenger Cyclope neritea in terms of emersion and food locating. This goal was achieved by carrying out short-term field experiments on a sandy beach on the European Atlantic coast (SW Spain). The results demonstrate that, as with the presence of carrion on the ground, human trampling affects the behavior of C. neritea, favoring its emersion to the sediment surface and its movement on the ground. It is hypothesized that this is a potential trophic facilitation by shellfishers, since the emersion and movement of gastropods at low tide is induced during the period when the amount of food on the ground increases due to shellfish gathering. Nevertheless, this increased activity also implies a higher predation risk for these scavengers while emerging from the sand. In order to avoid predation, gastropods generally use alarm cues, such as the detection of damaged conspecifics, as an anti-predatory strategy. The behavioral response of C neritea to the presence of damaged conspecifics was also studied. The results of this study highlight the fact that scavengers emerge from the sediment in response to trampling and the presence of carrion on the sediment surface. Further it is shown that although the presence of damaged conspecifics may act as a cue to gastropods, C neritea does not respond to this stimulus until it first makes contact. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

During such encounters, the toxic dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera uses the received intensity, duration and emission pattern of the bat's echolocation calls to determine when, and how many, defensive ultrasonic clicks to produce in return. These clicks, which constitute an acoustic startle response, act as warning signals against bats in flight. Using an integrated test of stimulus generalization and dishabituation, here we show that C. tenera is able to discriminate between the echolocation calls characteristic of a bat that has only just detected it versus those of a bat actively in pursuit of it. We also show that C. tenera habituates more profoundly to the former stimulus train ('early attack') than to the latter ('late attack'), even though it was initially equally responsive to both stimuli. Matched sensory and behavioural data indicate that reduced responsiveness reflects habituation and is not merely attributable to sensory adaptation or motor fatigue. In search of mates in the face of bats, C. tenera's ability to discriminate between attacking bats representing different levels of risk, and to habituate less so to those most dangerous, should function as an adaptive cost-benefit trade-off mechanism in nature.","[Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ So Denmark, Ctr Sound Commun, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Fullard, James H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Arthur, Benjamin J.; Hoy, Ronald R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Ratcliffe, JM (corresponding author), Univ So Denmark, Ctr Sound Commun, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",jmr@biology.sdu.dk,,,DNSRCDanish Natural Science Research Council; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NIDCDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01DC000103] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank Frank Phelan and Bruce Tufts at QUBS for logistical support, Coen Elemans and Peter Wall for MATLAB scripts and Merri Rosen, Annemarie Surlykke, Bob Wyttenbach and three referees for comments on the manuscript.

Individuals that maintain positions on the front, outside edge of the group encounter most predators first, but are more likely to access food patches before others. Therefore a trade-off exists in which a strategy maximizing safety, by staying in the group's center, may lower foraging success, whereas a strategy maximizing food acquisition may increase predation risk. We examined intragroup spatial positions for vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda relative to sex, age, dominance rank, and activity when the group was moving and when it was stationary. We used artificial food patches of varied richness to examine which individuals found new food sources and what share they obtained. When the group was stationary, high-ranking females tended to be at the group's center, while males and subordinates were at the group's edge. Moving and feeding occurred more than expected at the edge, while social behavior took place in the center. When the group was moving, most females stayed in the center of the group, but dominant males and the alpha female foraged at the front, outside edge of the group. These dominants also found more artificial food patches and foraged at greater interindividual distances than those in the center. Whether they found patches or scrounged at the patches found by others, high-ranking individuals obtained more food than subordinates, but their overall share was greatest when they acted as producers rather than scroungers. This likely explains why dominant individuals traded off predation risk for food acquisition by consistently foraging on the front, outside edge of the group farther from conspecifics.","[Teichroeb, Julie A.] Duke Univ, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [White, Maxine M.

Here we determined whether real motorboat noise affected the behavior, space use and escape response of a juvenile damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi) in the wild, and explored whether fish respond effectively to chemical and visual threats in the presence of two common types of motorboat noise. Noise from 30 hp 2-stroke outboard motors reduced boldness and activity of fish on habitat patches compared to ambient reef-sound controls. Fish also no longer responded to alarm odours with an antipredator response, instead increasing activity and space use, and fewer fish responded appropriately to a looming threat. In contrast, while there was a minor influence of noise from a 30 hp 4-stroke outboard on space use, there was no influence on their ability to respond to alarm odours, and no impact on their escape response. Evidence suggests that anthropogenic noise impacts the way juvenile fish assess risk, which will reduce individual fitness and survival, however, not all engine types cause major effects. This finding may give managers options by which they can reduce the impact of motorboat noise on inshore fish communities.","[McCormick, Mark I.; Allan, Bridie J.

Despite the ecological significance of this decline, surprisingly little is known about the resource needs and habitat use of these animals. Using global positioning system data collected from 2010 to 2013, we assessed resource selection of wildebeest inhabiting three study areas in Kenya with varying degrees of natural and anthropogenic disturbance to identify potential behavioral mechanisms underlying potential landscape-driven declines. Wildebeest were observed to consistently avoid anthropogenic features and dense woody cover, irrespective of season, suggestive of avoidance of landscape features that would likely be associated with increased predation risk. Wildebeest also avoided primary roads, particularly across the Athi-Kaputiei Plains where human density and landscape alteration was greatest. The strongest response to normalized difference vegetation index was observed across the Amboseli Basin, the least productive and anthropogenically altered of our three study areas, leading to pronounced seasonal shifts in space use. Selection of natural and anthropogenic features was similar across the Mara and Athi-Kaputiei Plains, with the exception of the response to roads which likely relates to differences in road use. We also observed strong shifts in space use between day and night periods, particularly in relation to anthropogenic features and likely related to human circadian activity patterns. The observed variability in selection provides detailed information to how wildebeest react to local environmental factors across landscapes, and provides insight to how landscape fragmentation amplifies habitat loss for wildebeest by driving spatial avoidance, a likely mechanism contributing to population declines in this species. The quantified responses of wildebeest to landscape features can aid future conservation management efforts and planning to sustain imperiled wildebeest populations.","[Stabach, J. A.; Boone, R.

However, because individuals have limited attention, focusing on a particular aspect of their acoustic environment may affect their ability to allocate attention elsewhere. Some previous studies support the distracted prey hypothesis, which suggests that animals may be distracted by any stimuli, inhibiting their ability to detect approaching predators. In this study, we further tested the distracted prey hypothesis by employing playback experiments to simultaneously examine the relative effects of 3 types of noises-anthropogenic sounds, conspecific nonalarm sounds, and heterospecific nonalarm sounds-as distractors for common mynas (Acridotheres tristis). We used 3 different stimuli: motorcycle noise, social common myna calls, and social red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) calls. We first examined myna response to each stimulus by measuring time allocation to various behaviors immediately before and during broadcasting the 3 playbacks. We then studied how these stimuli affected their antipredator behavior by measuring the distance at which they fled from an approaching predator (flight initiation distance). We found that mynas responded to all 3 stimuli by delaying their return to relaxed behavior following the playbacks compared with a silent treatment. In contrast to the distracted prey hypothesis, we found that mynas fled at greater distances when hearing red-vented bulbul social vocalizations than during our silent treatment. This suggests that rather than distracting, some social vocalizations may enhance prey vigilance and lead to earlier flight.","[Hubbard, Lilah; King, William; Vu, Anmy; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,"King, William/0000-0002-3799-1595; Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),D.T.B. is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation.,,59,5,6,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

A notable example is human outstanding ability to cooperate with others, in all its complex forms, depicting the reality of a highly demanding social framework in which humans need to be integrated as to attain physical and mental benefits. Considering the importance of social engagement, it's not entirely unexpected that most psychiatric disorders involve some disruption of normal social behaviour, ranging from an abnormal absence to a significant increase of social functioning. It is however surprising that knowledge on these social anxiety disorders still remains so limited. Here we review the literature focusing on the social and cooperative toolbox of 3 fish model species (cleaner fishes, guppies and zebrafish) which are amenable systems to test for social disorders. We build on current knowledge based on ethological information, arising from studies on cooperative behaviour in cleanerfishes and guppies, while profiting from the advantages of the intense use of zebrafish, to create novel paradigms aiming at the major socio-cognitive modules/dimensions in fish species. This focus may enable the discovery of putative conserved endpoints which are relevant for research into social disorders. We suggest that cross-species, cross-domain, functional and genetic approaches could provide a wider array of information on the neurobiological bases of social and cooperative behaviour, crucial to understanding the neural bases of social disorders and key to finding novel avenues towards treatment.","[Soares, Marta C.; Cardoso, Sonia C.] Univ Porto, CIBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Carvalho, Tamires dos Santos; Maximino, Caio] Univ Fed Sul & Sudeste Para, IESB, Unidade 3, Maraba, Brazil",,"Soares, MC (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CIBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",marta.soares@cibio.up.pt,"Soares, Marta C/J-4448-2013","Soares, Marta C/0000-0002-5213-2377; Cardoso, Sonia/0000-0002-5985-7792",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology-FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/MAR/105276/2008];  [SFRH/BPD/109433/2015],"MCS is currently supported by SFRH/BPD/109433/2015.

Flight initiation distance (FID) and the distance at which birds detect a threat, alert distance (AD), have been used as indicators of the ability of birds to detect potential predators. In this study we compared the two aforementioned measures of risk reaction for the House sparrow and the Orange-breasted bunting, two bird species inhabiting the same urban areas, and assessed if they were related with sex, flock size, and environmental factors. We performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to explore the relationships between environmental factors and ADs and FIDs. Both behavioral responses were significantly lower for House sparrows. Although we did not find significant relationships between the assessed variables (sex, flock size, environmental factors) and bunting ADs and FIDs, we did find House sparrow males to be bolder (showing shorter ADs and FIDs), as well as larger ADs and FIDs for sparrows with increasing flock size. House sparrow ADs and FIDs were positively related with herbaceous plant cover and negatively related with minimum building height. In general, House sparrows showed to be bolder than Orange-breasted buntings, with differential responses of the sparrow related with sex, flock size, and different environmental factors. Having recorded bolder House sparrow males could be due to increases in aggressiveness related to the breeding season. Our results add to the lacking behavioral information available for the endemic Orange-breasted bunting and provide insights on the variation of the behavior of House sparrows in small urban areas.","[Garcia-Arroyo, Michelle; MacGregor-Fors, Ian] Inst Ecol AC, Red Ambiente & Sustentabilidad, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91073, Veracruz, Mexico",,"MacGregor-Fors, I (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Red Ambiente & Sustentabilidad, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91073, Veracruz, Mexico.",macgregor.ian@gmail.com,"MacGregor-Fors, Ian/P-1455-2014","MacGregor-Fors, Ian/0000-0003-3198-7322; Garcia-Arroyo, Michelle/0000-0002-9167-4777","Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; National Council of Science and Technology [CONACYT 700755]; Doctoral Program of the Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.

Progress in quantification of evidence-based effectiveness and selection of the best interventions raises new questions, such as the existence of thresholds to identify truly effective interventions. Current classification of more and less effective interventions is subjective and statistically unjustified. This study describes a novel method to differentiate true and untrue effectiveness on a basis of false positive risk (FPR). I have collected 152 cases of applications of damage-reducing interventions from 102 scientific publications, 26 countries, 22 predator species, and 6 categories of interventions. The analysis has shown that the 95% confidence interval of the relative risk of predator-caused damage was 0.10-0.25 for true effectiveness (FPR < 0.05) and 0.35-0.56 for untrue effectiveness (FPR >= 0.05). This means that damage was reduced by 75-90% for truly effective interventions and by 44-65% for interventions of untrue effectiveness. Based on this, it was specified that truly effective interventions have the relative risk <= 0.25 (damage reduction >= 75%) and the effectiveness of interventions with the relative risk > 0.25 (damage reduction < 75%) is untrue. This threshold is statistically well-justified, stable, easy to remember, and practical to use in anti-predator interventions. More research is essential to know how this threshold holds true for other conservation interventions aiming to reduce negative outcomes (e.g., poaching rates) or increase positive outcomes (e.g., species richness).","[Khorozyan, Igor] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Conservat Biol, Gottingen, Germany",,"Khorozyan, I (corresponding author), Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Conservat Biol, Gottingen, Germany.",igor.khorozyan@biologie.uni-goettingen.de,,"Khorozyan, Igor/0000-0002-0657-7500",,,,61,0,0,3,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Translocation is often used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27 nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion, removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.","[Lehrer, Elizabeth W.; Kilgour, R.

Empirical assessments have shown that the functional and numerical responses of predators to human disturbances are variable, yet spatial changes in predation risk by two predators have seldom been studied for prey occurring in human-modified landscapes. Using the boreal caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou - grey wolf Canis lupus - black bear Ursus americanus system in eastern Canada, we investigated whether responses of prey towards one predator could concomitantly increase risk of predation from another predator exhibiting a different foraging tactic. We investigated trade-offs made by solitary caribou females and mothers accompanied by their calf during the period of highest calf vulnerability and compared the behaviour of mothers that would eventually lose their calf to predation to that of mothers whose calf survived until the following year. We modelled habitat selection using different metrics of forage based on field measurements and digital maps and developed empirical models of predation risk and prey behaviour using GPS data collected on both predators and prey. Mothers accompanied by their calf seemed to compromise foraging opportunities for safety, as opposed to solitary females who showed no particular avoidance of areas used by predators. Although caribou mothers adopted selection strategies that could have protected their offspring from wolves, females that eventually lost their calf to predation selected for vegetative associations that were favourable to bears.Synthesis and applications. We determined that mothers that most strongly avoided suitable wolf habitat were also those that most strongly selected suitable bear habitat, suggesting that by using antipredator strategies aimed at reducing predation risk from wolves, caribou exposed their offspring to increased predation risk from bears. This result is of paramount conservation value as bears were responsible for 94% of caribou calf kills in this system. In the short term, conservation efforts for boreal caribou may benefit from the management of bear populations by means of liberal hunting regulations or predator control. In the long term, however, these actions should be used in conjunction with the protection of potential calving areas away from cutblocks and roads.","[Leblond, Mathieu; Ouellet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Ctr Northern Studies, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Dussault, Christian] Minist Forets Faune & Parc Quebec, Direct Faune Terrestre & Avifaune, 880 Chemin St Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4X4, Canada; [St-Laurent, Martin-Hugues] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Ctr Northern Studies, Ctr Forest Res, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",,"Leblond, M (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Ctr Northern Studies, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",mathieu.leblond.5@ulaval.ca,"Leblond, Mathieu/J-9646-2019","Leblond, Mathieu/0000-0002-2833-6265","Ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Parcs; Ministere des Transports du Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; Fondation de la Faune du Quebec; World Wildlife Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR","We thank L.

However, little is known about how farmers define or assess temperament. Focus group discussions were carried out in order to analyze the perceptions of farmers regarding a series of temperament traits of animals, focusing on the Pyrenean cattle breed. Farmers described animal temperament using several adjectives such as strong, aggressive, nervous, fearful, brave, or smart, which account for their integrative vision of this concept. They reported a differential long-term development of the temperament of cows and bulls and mentioned that external features are not reliable indicators of temperament as compared with animal behavior. Sensory acuity, such as sight, hearing, and smell, were thought to be related to temperament. The results of this study are useful to better understand the decisions of farmers about cattle buying, selling, or culling, and their perspective about temperament should be considered in the research and design of genetic improvement schemes. Understanding temperament is an important part of cattle production since undesirable temperament may cause serious problems associated with aggression, maternal care, and human safety. However, little is known about how farmers define or assess temperament, especially in autochthonous cattle breeds. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of farmers about the temperament of the Pyrenean cattle breed with special attention to beef cow-calf systems in Spain. The methodology used to obtain the information was focus group discussions (FGD). Farmers defined temperament as a behavioural response to challenging situations imposed by human handling. Specific terms used were related to active or passive reactions to fear (e.g., strong, aggressive, nervous, fearful). The speed of response to stimuli was also important. Female temperament was thought to become more docile with age while bull temperament was more variable. Maternal aggressiveness was highlighted as a potential human safety problem, but also desirable in an extensively bred animal who may need to defend calves against predators. Anatomical characteristics were seen as unreliable predictors of temperament, while behavioural indicators were more widely used, such as alertness, which was a general trait of the breed, and gaze, which, when associated with an alert expression, suggests a potential threat. Sensory acuity, such as sight and smell, were thought to be related with temperament in some FGDs but there was no overall agreement as to whether different behavioural responses were due to differences in sensory acuity. The results from the study could be useful during training programs or in the development of new genetic selection schemes and evaluation protocols involving cattle temperament.","[Estevez-Moreno, Laura X.; Miranda-de la Lama, Genaro C.; Maria, Gustavo A.] Univ Zaragoza, Agrifood Inst Aragon IA2, Dept Anim Prod & Food Sci, Zaragoza 50013, Spain; [Villarroel, Morris] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, ETSIAAB Agr Prod, CEIGRAM, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Garcia, Laura] Aragonese Assoc Farmers Pyrenean Cattle Breed ASA, Zaragoza 50194, Spain; [Abecia, Jose Alfonso] Univ Zaragoza, Environm Sci Inst IUCA, Dept Anim Prod & Food Sci, Zaragoza 50013, Spain; [Santolaria, Pilar] Univ Zaragoza, Environm Sci Inst IUCA, Dept Anim Prod & Food Sci, Huesca 22071, Spain",,"Estevez-Moreno, LX (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Agrifood Inst Aragon IA2, Dept Anim Prod & Food Sci, Zaragoza 50013, Spain.",lestevez@unizar.es; genaro@unizar.es; morris.villarroel@upm.es; lauraasapi@gmail.com; alf@unizar.es; psantola@unizar.es; levrino@unizar.es,"Santolaria, Pilar P/L-1015-2014; la Lama, Genaro Miranda-de/Q-8440-2016; Villarroel, Morris/I-4387-2013; Abecia, Jose-Alfonso/F-5653-2010","Santolaria, Pilar P/0000-0001-8991-325X; la Lama, Genaro Miranda-de/0000-0002-6848-1010; Villarroel, Morris/0000-0003-2542-3985; Abecia, Jose-Alfonso/0000-0003-2827-3054","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg Program V-A Spain-France-Andorra, POCTEFA [EFA144_16/DIETAPYR2]","This research was funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg Program V-A Spain-France-Andorra, POCTEFA (2014-2020) EFA144_16/DIETAPYR2.",,77,3,3,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,JAN,2021,11,1,,,,,,,82,10.3390/ani11010082,,,18,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,PV0JF,WOS:000609681700001,33466326,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-04-19,

The present study evaluated the ability of 8-OH-DPAT (0.05-10 mg/kg, SC, 5) and gepirone (2.5-10 mg/kg, IP, 30), a full- and a partial agonist at 5-HT1A sites, as well as pirenperone (0.25-1 mg/kg, IP, 30), a preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, to exert an anxiolytic-like action in the MDTB. The most consistent effect of both 5-HT1A receptor agonists across tests was a marked reduction in predator assessment activity and defensive attack behavior. In contrast, neither of the two ligands was able to reduce flight responses to the approaching predator, and both failed to reduce in a specific manner contextual defense behaviors after the predator was removed. The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist pirenperone did not provide significant indication of an anxiolytic effect on predator assessment activity and postpredator potentiation of contextual defense responses, and had negligible influence on antipredator defensive behavior. The most interesting exception to this profile was a dose-related reduction in flight-related measures. In view of previous results indicating that the panic-promoting drug yohimbine increases flight/escape reactions and that the panicolytic compound alprazolam reduces these responses, we tentatively suggest that the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist pirenperone may have some efficacy in improving panic attacks. In addition, the lack of effect of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists on these flight responses is consistent with clinical findings indicating that these agents are of limited use in the treatment of panic disorder. These findings suggest that the MDTB provides behavioural measures capable of differentiating between various classes of antianxiety drugs.","UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,BEKESY LAB NEUROBIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & REPROD BIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,DEPT PSYCHOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822",,,,"Griebel, Guy/F-8752-2014","Griebel, Guy/0000-0002-6052-9438",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH042803] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR03061] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH42803] Funding Source: Medline,,,66,52,52,0,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0091-3057,,,PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BE,Pharmacol.

Consequently, numerous habitats will become less suitable for some species due to an increase in perceived risk of predation. Studies show that different species vary greatly in their tolerance to human disturbance, but these findings are typically only based on flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which animals flee when approached by a potential predator including a human). The aim of this study was to broaden the general view of escape behaviour by including distance fled (DF) in the analyses. We measured FID and DF in 699 birds belonging to 17 species in Estonian urban and rural settlements. We calculated the relationships between two types of escape decisions and behavioural, environmental and morphological parameters. There was a positive relationship between FID and DF for heavier species, but not for lighter species suggesting mass-dependent differences in the cost of escape. Flock size and starting distance in rural habitats were important predictors of FID while distance to refuge was only positively correlated with DF. Birds in rural habitats escaped earlier and further and exhibited a positive relationship between starting distance and FID, whereas no such trend was seen in urban birds, possibly due to a narrow zone of awareness. Our findings suggest that DF represents an independent and informative additional measure of antipredator behaviour that together with FID provides a more integrated view of the costs of escape. This, in turn, facilitates finding effective ways for mitigating effects of anthropogenic disturbance on wild animals. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Knowledge of wildlife responses to human disturbance is crucial for the management of increasing and expanding populations of large animals. We investigated flight initiation distance (FID) and aggressive responses of the European bison-the largest terrestrial mammal of Europe-to human disturbance in the Bialowieza Forest (NE Poland). When encountered by humans, bison usually flee. Aggression was observed in only 0.4% of approach attempts. Mean FID was 77 +/- 46 m and was influenced by habitat, sex, and supplementary feeding intensity. Females showed greater timidity than males, FID was lower in forest than in open habitats, and supplementary feeding caused a drop in FID. In 84.5% of all documented aggression cases, bison attacks were provoked by humans approaching too close to the bison or by deliberate scaring them. Males were more aggressive than females, and attacked mainly during the rut, while females attacked during the winter and calving. Bison attacked in built-up areas significantly more often than expected. The mean critical distance of attacks was 21 +/- 2 m. Most attacks took the form of a short chase preceded by warning signs. Goring was observed in 22.7% of all aggression cases and no fatalities were recorded. Our study shows that bison are not dangerous animals and only manifest aggression in response to prolonged disturbance at close ranges. The education of people and recommendations for minimum approach distances should ensure a low rate of disturbance and safety when encountering large mammals.","[Haidt, Andzelika] Forest Res Inst, Sekocin Stary, Raszyn, Poland; [Kaminski, Tomasz; Borowik, Tomasz; Kowalczyk, Rafal] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Bialowieza, Poland",,"Kowalczyk, R (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Bialowieza, Poland.",rkowal@ibs.bialowieza.pl,"Haidt, And?elika/AAT-5922-2021; Borowik, Tomasz/W-4008-2018; Haidt, And?elika/R-9055-2018","Haidt, And?elika/0000-0002-3570-8899; Borowik, Tomasz/0000-0003-0321-8200; Haidt, And?elika/0000-0002-3570-8899; Kowalczyk, Rafal/0000-0001-7264-2158",Polish Ministry of Sciences and Information Technology [2P04F 011 26]; EU LIFE Programme [LIFE06 NAT/PL/000105],"The study was financed by the Polish Ministry of Sciences and Information Technology (grant no 2P04F 011 26)(to RK); the EU LIFE Programme (project no LIFE06 NAT/PL/000105); http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3146.

Twenty percent of preparturient females made extensive movements (greater than or equal to5 km) immediately before giving birth. Females selected (use was greater than availability) sites for giving birth (n = 39) that were on southerly exposures with low soil moisture and high variability in overstory cover. Moose selected birth sites based on micro-site characteristics rather than on broad types of habitat, which were used in proportion to their availability. Spatial distribution of birth sites did not differ significantly from random locations. We hypothesize that such unpredictable behavior by females is a strategy to avoid predators. Parturient females also selected sites with high visibility that were located at high elevation, which ostensibly allowed them to see and then hide from approaching predators. We rejected the hypothesis, however, that moose in this population spaced themselves away from predators or avoided habitat types favored by large carnivores. Likewise, we rejected the hypothesis that moose gave birth close to human developments to avoid predators; random sites were >100 m closer to human developments than were birth sites. Cover of forage, especially willows (Salix), was more than twice as abundant at birth sites than random sites. Forage quality, as indexed by nitrogen content and in vitro dry matter digestibility, was slightly but significantly higher at birth sites. An inverse relationship between visibility and availability of forage indicated that female moose made tradeoffs between risk of predation and food in selecting sites to give birth. Thus, maternal females coped with a risky environment; they gave birth at sites that helped them minimize risk of predation but exhibited risk-averse behavior with respect to the forage necessary to support the high cost of lactation. We hypothesize that risk of predation prevented moose from seeking birth sites with more forage and, hence, a greater nutritional reward, which reduced the variance in forage availability at birth sites.","Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, La Grande, OR 97850 USA",,"Bowyer, RT (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",,,,,,,84,138,149,2,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,1545-1542,,J MAMMAL,J.

We collected data at a site closed to recreation and at one with regular recreation and found that painted turtles regularly exposed to the presence of humans had significantly shorter average flight initiation distances compared with those at the nonrecreation site.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms shaping vigilance behavior provides relevant insights on factors influencing individual fitness. We investigated the role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on vigilance behavior in Mediterranean mouflon (Ovis gmelini musimonxOvis sp.) in a study site spatially and temporally contrasted in human pressures. Both sexes were less vigilant in the wildlife reserve compared to surrounding unprotected areas, except for males during the hunting period. During this period, males tended to be less strictly restricted to the reserve than females what might lead to a pervasive effect of hunting within the protected area, resulting in an increase in male vigilance. It might also be a rutting effect that did not occur in unprotected areas because males vigilance was already maximal in response to human disturbances. In both sexes, yearlings were less vigilant than adults, probably because they traded off vigilance for learning and energy acquisition and/or because they relied on adult experience present in the group. Similarly, non-reproductive females benefited of the vigilance effort provided by reproductive females when belonging to the same group. However, in the absence of reproductive females, non-reproductive females were as vigilant as reproductive females. Increasing group size was only found to reduce vigilance in females (up to 17.5%), not in males. We also showed sex-specific responses to habitat characteristics. Females increased their vigilance when habitat visibility decreased (up to 13.8%) whereas males increased their vigilance when feeding on low quality sites, i.e., when concomitant increase in chewing time can be devoted to vigilance with limited costs. Our global approach was able to disentangle the sex-specific sources of variation in mouflon vigilance and stressed the importance of reserves in managing and conserving wild sheep populations.","[Benoist, Stephanie; Garel, Mathieu] Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Ctr Natl Etud & Rech Appl Faune Montagne, Gieres, France; [Cugnasse, Jean-Marc] Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Direct Etud & Rech, Toulouse, France; [Blanchard, Pierrick] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, ENFA, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol,UMR 5174, Toulouse, France",,"Garel, M (corresponding author), Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Ctr Natl Etud & Rech Appl Faune Montagne, Gieres, France.",mathieu.garel@oncfs.gouv.fr,,,Languedoc-Roussilon regionRegion Auvergne-Rhone-AlpesRegion Bourgogne-Franche-ComteRegion Hauts-de-FranceRegion Nouvelle-Aquitaine,"This project was financially supported by the Languedoc-Roussilon region.

Specifically, we quantified the gulls' behavioural response towards natural predators, a human intruder, experimental predator decoys, and a nonpredatory decoy. Neither the distance at which nesting Sabine's gulls first reacted to natural predators, nor the relative intensity of their response, differed with incubation stage or predator type. However, response behaviour was highly variable among pairs. In response to decoys, Sabine's gulls responded strongly towards predatory species, compared with a non-predatory species. The distance at which they first swooped at a human intruder was also variable, and there was no seasonal trend. Sabine's gulls were often joined in nest defence by conspecifics, Arctic terns, and shorebirds nesting nearby, although the number of conspecifics involved in attacks was not related to the proximity of neighbouring nests.","Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Psychol, Cognit & Behav Ecol Programme, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada; Carleton Univ, Canadian Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada",,"Stenhouse, IJ (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Psychol, Cognit & Behav Ecol Programme, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada.",istenhouse@audubon.org,,,,,,35,21,23,3,29,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0289-0771,1439-5444,,J ETHOL,J.

So far it is unclear whether the toad can invade forest habitats, and empirical evidence of its impact on native predators is lacking. We used radio tracking to investigate the spatial behaviour of adult toads in a small parcel of lowland humid forest and we quantify the disruptive effects of toad poisoning on a native frog-eating snake, the Malagasy cat-eyed snake (Madagascarophis colubrinus). We used N-mixture models to estimate the population size of cat-eyed snakes, and used the mortality events recorded in the same area to obtain an estimate of monthly mortality rate of snakes due to toad poisoning. Our results point to a drastic mortality rate of snakes that, if constant through the year, could halve the predator population, with the potential risk of local extirpation. We expect cat-eyed snake populations across rural and suburban areas of Toamasina to be severely affected by the toad invasion, and suggest that future research should investigate the effects of indirect facilitation of human-commensal rodents and the potential repercussions on human health and well-being.","[Licata, Fulvio; Crottini, Angelica] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Campus Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Licata, Fulvio; Crottini, Angelica] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal; [Licata, Fulvio; Crottini, Angelica] CIBIO, BIOPOLIS Program Genom Biodivers & Land Planning, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Harison, Rodino Fetraharijaona] Univ Toamasina, ISSEDD Inst Super Sci Environm & Dev Durable, Toamasina, Madagascar; [Ficetola, Gentile Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Milan, Italy; [Ficetola, Gentile Francesco] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Lab Ecol Alpine, LECA,CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Freeman, Karen; Muller, Benjamin J.; Ponga, Virginia Rodriguez] Madagascar Fauna & Flora Grp, BP442, Toamasina 501, Madagascar; [Andreone, Franco] Museo Reg Sci Nat, Via G Giolitti 36, I-10123 Turin, Italy",,"Licata, F; Crottini, A (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Campus Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.; Licata, F; Crottini, A (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal.; Licata, F; Crottini, A (corresponding author), CIBIO, BIOPOLIS Program Genom Biodivers & Land Planning, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal.",tiliquait@yahoo.it; acrottini@cibio.up.pt,"Ficetola, Gentile Francesco/A-2813-2008; Andreone, Franco/H-4942-2012; Crottini, Angelica/I-7680-2013","Ficetola, Gentile Francesco/0000-0003-3414-5155; Andreone, Franco/0000-0001-9809-5818; Licata, Fulvio/0000-0001-8234-9676; Crottini, Angelica/0000-0002-8505-3050","Saint Louis Zoo's Field Research for Conservation program (FRC) of the Wildcare Institute [2018.01]; Portuguese National Funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia-with the Exploratory Research Project [IF/00209/2014/CP1256/CT0011]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [SFRH/BD/131722/2017]; Investigator FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [IF/00209/2014, 2020.00823, CEECIND/CP1601/CT003]",Our fieldwork was made possible with the support of the Saint Louis Zoo's Field Research for Conservation program (FRC#2018.01) of the Wildcare Institute and Portuguese National Funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia-with the Exploratory Research Project IF/00209/2014/CP1256/CT0011.

Acoustic telemetry and network analyses were used to investigate the spatial ecology of bull sharks, the species responsible for most shark bites in Reunion Island, one of the world's shark bite hotspots. The west coast of the island was not used uniformly by every individual, with size predicting the movements of sharks along the coast. Node-based metrics - closeness, node strength, and cumulated continuous residency times - derived from up to 181 monthly movement networks from 20 individuals, revealed that smaller sharks (<250 cm total length) primarily used the south-west coast while larger individuals spent most of their time in the northern region with regular visits to multiple areas along the coast. This study provides essential knowledge on bull shark behaviour and central areas used at different periods of the year, which correlates well with the dynamics of observed shark bites.

However, the extent to which prey responses at the interface between natural and anthropogenic habitats may be compared to those at the interface between natural habitats is unclear. Here, we used a shared-predator system to investigate the spatial response of red-necked nightjars (Caprimulgus ruficollis) to changing predation risk on roads, measured as the abundance of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and their primary prey (rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus). Because all three species coexist closely on unpaved roads in Donana National Park (Spain), we predicted that nightjars would experience increased predation risk during periods of high fox and low rabbit abundances. Birds could then modify their space use at a broad scale by moving away from risky unpaved roads or, at a finer scale, by seeking foraging microsites facilitating escape from attacks. Between 2011 and 2012, mean rabbit abundance on roads increased by 50%, and fox abundance decreased by 80%, indicating a substantial decrease in predation risk for nightjars. Unexpectedly, nightjar occurrence on roads did not increase as a consequence of the decrease in fox predation risk. However, nightjars foraging on roads became less apprehensive in their use of linear strips of roadside cover, which is known to function as a physical barrier against fox attacks. Specifically, under high predation risk, most nightjars perched on the ground nearby (< 15 cm) tall (> 150 cm) vegetation, whereas when predation risk decreased, they shifted to more exposed microsites near shorter (< 1 m) stands, but rarely close to cover (> 45 cm). Nightjars' preference for areas of high predator abundance strongly suggests that flexible microhabitat selection allows them to manage the overall predation risk independently of predator abundance. Our results highlight the importance of linear developments in determining risk exposure and prey use of apparently dangerous habitats and thus may contribute to a better understanding of risky behaviors of prey.","[Camacho, Carlos; Potti, Jaime] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Av Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Saez-Gomez, Pedro] Univ Huelva, Dept Integrat Sci, Campus Univ El Carmen,Av Andalucia, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Maria Fedriani, Jose] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Av Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain; [Maria Fedriani, Jose] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, InBIO, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal",,"Camacho, C (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Donana, Av Americo Vespucio, Seville 41092, Spain.",ccamacho@ebd.csic.es,"Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018; Sáez-Gómez, Pedro/P-6195-2019; Camacho, Carlos/AAC-7877-2019","Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Sáez-Gómez, Pedro/0000-0001-5105-3960; Camacho, Carlos/0000-0002-9704-5816; Potti, Jaime/0000-0002-2284-0022","Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [IF/00728/2013, PEst/CC6316]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [SVP-2013-067686]","We thank Sonia Sanchez and Basti Palacios for help during data collection, Carlos Davila and Carlos Molina for logistic support, and Lorenzo Perez for scientific discussion.

We included several measures of plumage coloration: human perception of vividness from images in field guides, total intensity from reflectance spectra of museum skins, contrasts calculated from physiological models of these spectra parameterized for both raptors and humans, chroma, and spectral saturation. We investigated how well these measurements predicted risk assessment in ten species of birds in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. We quantified how each species responded to playbacks of a predator's calls and compared this response to that elicited by songs from a non-predatory, sympatric bird. We found that human-determined measures of vividness best predicted anti-predator responses of birds-more vividly colored species responded more to predators than duller species. No spectrophotometric variable explained variation in species reactions to a predator call. Our results suggest that vivid birds may compensate for their conspicuousness by being more responsive to the sound of predators and that more work is needed to better evaluate how animal coloration is quantified in comparative studies.","[Journey, Lexi; Drury, Jonathan P.; Haymer, Michael; Rose, Kate; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,"Blumstein, Daniel/0000-0001-5793-9244",UCLA Office of Instructional Development; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1119660] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank the UCLA Office of Instructional Development, and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology for partial support.

We investigated escape by numerous populations exposed to differing predation pressure of two sister species of Podarcis lizards in the Balearic Islands. Our main findings are that flight initiation distance was greater in Podarcis pityusensis than Podarcis lilfordi and increased as predation pressure increased in P. pityusensis. Island tameness led to extinction of P. lilfordi on Menorca and Mallorca following anthropogenic introduction of predators; this species is extant only on nearby islets. The lack of relationship between recent predation pressure and flight initiation distance in P. lilfordi indicates that the historically acquired deficit in the ability to adjust escape behaviour to predation pressure still exists. Podarcis pityusensis, which was exposed to greater natural predation pressure before human introduction of predators, survives on Ibiza and Formentera, as well as on islets. Retention of the ability to respond to predation pressure is consistent with our finding that flight initiation distance increases as predation pressure increases among current populations.

Additionally, human re-infection after treatment can be a problem where there are high numbers of infected snails in the environment. Recent experiments indicate that aquatic factors, including plants, nutrients, or predators, can influence snail abundance and parasite production within infected snails, both components of human risk. This study investigated how snail host abundance and release of cercariae (the free swimming stage infective to humans) varies at water access sites in an endemic region in Senegal, a setting where human schistosomiasis prevalence is among the highest globally. Methods/Principal findings We collected snail intermediate hosts at 15 random points stratified by three habitat types at 36 water access sites, and counted cercarial production by each snail after transfer to the laboratory on the same day. We found that aquatic vegetation was positively associated with per-capita cercarial release by snails, probably because macrophytes harbor periphyton resources that snails feed upon, and well-fed snails tend to produce more parasites. In contrast, the abundance of aquatic macroinvertebrate snail predators was negatively associated with per-capita cercarial release by snails, probably because of several potential sublethal effects on snails or snail infection, despite a positive association between snail predators and total snail numbers at a site, possibly due to shared habitat usage or prey tracking by the predators. Thus, complex bottom-up and top-down ecological effects in this region plausibly influence the snail shedding rate and thus, total local density of schistosome cercariae. Conclusions/Significance Our study suggests that aquatic macrophytes and snail predators can influence per-capita cercarial production and total abundance of snails. Thus, snail control efforts might benefit by targeting specific snail habitats where parasite production is greatest. In conclusion, a better understanding of top-down and bottom-up ecological factors that regulate densities of cercarial release by snails, rather than solely snail densities or snail infection prevalence, might facilitate improved schistosomiasis control. Author summary Over 800 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis and environmental factors that regulate densities of cercariae parasites that infect humans remain poorly understood. We sampled a spatially extensive area at 36 water-access points in northern Senegal, and quantified densities of snail intermediate hosts, snail predators, and aquatic vegetation in each sample, as well as cercariae released from snails after they were brought to the laboratory. We found that the quantity of submerged aquatic vegetation, particularlyCeratophyllumspp., was positively associated with schistosome cercariae released per infected snail, and total potential cercariae released by the collected snails per water access site. In contrast, the abundance of aquatic predators near infected snails (in the same sweep) was negatively associated with the per-capita cercarial release by infected snails, but positively associated with total snail abundance per site. Additionally, snail densities and potential cercarial densities (estimated as the sum of cercariae released by all collected, infected snails at a site) were only weakly correlated, suggesting that snail densities alone might not accurately reflect total potential of those snails to emit schistosome cercariae. Overall, a better understanding of aquatic factors that can influence the production of schistosome cercariae under field conditions, rather than snail host abundance alone, might facilitate improvements in schistosomiasis monitoring and control.","[Haggerty, Christopher J.

Given that snakes are the first of primates' major predators, natural selection may have fostered efficient snake detection mechanisms to allow for optimal defensive behavior. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for a brain-anchored evolved predisposition to rapidly detect snakes in humans, which does not depend on previous exposure or knowledge about snakes. To do so, we recorded scalp electrical brain activity in 7- to 10-month-old infants watching sequences of flickering animal pictures. All animals were presented in their natural background. We showed that glancing at snakes generates specific neural responses in the infant brain, that are higher in amplitude than those generated by frogs or caterpillars, especially in the occipital region of the brain. The temporal dynamics of these neural responses support that infants devote increased attention to snakes than to non-snake stimuli. These results therefore demonstrate that a single fixation at snakes is sufficient to generate a prompt and large selective response in the infant brain. They argue for the existence in humans of an inborn, brain-anchored mechanism to swiftly detect snakes based on their characteristic visual features.","[Bertels, J.; de Heering, A.; Cleeremans, A.; Destrebecqz, A.] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, ULB Neurosci Inst UNI, Ctr Res Cognit & Neurosci CRCN, Consciousness Cognit & Computat Grp CO3, Brussels, Belgium; [Bertels, J.; Bourguignon, M.; De Tiege, X.] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Lab Cartog Fonct Cerveau LCFC, ULB Neurosci Inst UNI, Brussels, Belgium; [Chetail, F.] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, ULB Neurosci Inst UNI, Ctr Res Cognit & Neurosci CRCN, Lab Cognit Langage Dev LCLD, Brussels, Belgium",,"Bertels, J (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, ULB Neurosci Inst UNI, Ctr Res Cognit & Neurosci CRCN, Consciousness Cognit & Computat Grp CO3, Brussels, Belgium.; Bertels, J (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Lab Cartog Fonct Cerveau LCFC, ULB Neurosci Inst UNI, Brussels, Belgium.",jbertels@ulb.ac.be,"de Heering, Adelaide/A-6482-2017","de Heering, Adelaide/0000-0001-5843-7406; De Tiege, Xavier/0000-0003-0127-089X",FRS - FNRS grantFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [F.4524.10]; Fondation Universitaire de Belgique,"This work was supported by a FRS - FNRS grant (F.4524.10).

But there is comparatively little information available on escape responses by free-ranging animals to vehicle approach versus predators/humans. Methods: We examined responses (alert distance and flight-initiation distance) of focal Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) to vehicle approach (15.6 m.s(-1)) in a semi-natural setting and given full opportunity to escape. We manipulated the direction of the vehicle approach (direct versus tangential) and availability of social information about the vehicle approach (companion group visually exposed or not to the vehicle). Results: We found that both categorical factors interacted to affect alert and escape behaviors. Focal geese used mostly personal information to become alert to the vehicle under high risk scenarios (direct approach), but they combined personal and social information to become alert in low risk scenarios (tangential approach). Additionally, when social information was not available from the companion group, focal birds escaped at greater distances under direct compared to tangential approaches. However, when the companion group could see the vehicle approaching, focal birds escaped at similar distances irrespective of vehicle direction. Finally, geese showed a greater tendency to take flight when the vehicle approached directly, as opposed to a side step or walking away from the vehicle. Conclusions: We suggest that the perception of risk to vehicle approach (likely versus unlikely collision) is weighted by the availability of social information in the group; a phenomenon not described before in the context of animal-vehicle interactions. Notably, when social information is available, the effects of heightened risk associated with a direct approach might be reduced, leading to the animal delaying the escape, which could ultimately increase the chances of a collision. Also, information on a priori escape distances required for surviving a vehicle approach (based on species behavior and vehicle approach speeds) can inform planning, such as location of designated cover or safe areas. Future studies should assess how information from vehicle approach flows within a flock, including aspects of vehicle speed and size, metrics that affect escape decision-making.","[Blackwell, Bradley F.; Seamans, Thomas W.; DeVault, Travis L.; Pfeiffer, Morgan B.] USDA, Natl Widlife Res Ctr, Wildlife Serv, Sandusky, OH 43420 USA; [Lima, Steven L.] Indiana State Univ, Dept Biol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; [Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Blackwell, BF (corresponding author), USDA, Natl Widlife Res Ctr, Wildlife Serv, Sandusky, OH 43420 USA.",Bradley.F.Blackwell@usda.gov,,"Pfeiffer, Morgan/0000-0002-1079-5295",USDA National Wildlife Research CenterUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Indiana State University,"The USDA National Wildlife Research Center provided funding for the research and salaries for Bradley F.

Non-verbal communication by humans, both intentional and unintentional, can be interpreted by other species. We tested whether American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) were sensitive to human facial features under field conditions by comparing flight initiation distances and urgency of escape behavior to human approaches varying in eye contact and facial expression. We first examined whether crows distinguish between an approaching human who is directly gazing at them and a human approaching them with an averted gaze. In a second experiment, we tested whether crows differentiate a smiling from scowling human approaching them with direct or averted gaze. In the first experiment, we found that crows fled sooner and more urgently when humans were directly gazing at them. Similarly, in the second experiment, crows responded sooner to a direct vs. averted gaze; however, they did not react differently to varying human facial expressions. We suggest that crows use human gaze as a reliable visual cue compared with facial expressions when making decisions about responding to approaching humans. This is the first study to show that a wild corvid species changes its behavior based on human gaze, possibly representing an adaptation to living in human-dominated urban areas and suggesting crows might perceive human intention by this visual cue.","[Clucas, Barbara; Marzluff, John M.; Mackovjak, David; Palmquist, Ila] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Clucas, Barbara] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA",,"Clucas, B (corresponding author), Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, 1 Harpst St, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",barbara.clucas@humboldt.edu,,"Marzluff, John/0000-0002-6266-4975",McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program (USDA),We would like to thank Luis Ebensperger and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions on a previous version of this manuscript.

Since the adaptive value of boldness is context dependent, the benefit of a distinct personality is less clear when the environment is unpredictable. An ability to modulate behaviour can be beneficial, although as behavioural plasticity itself may be costly this depends on the levels of environmental stability. Both boldness and its plasticity are linked with physiological stress coping mechanisms, whereby animals with reduced glucocorticoid responses to stress are bolder and less flexible in behaviour. We investigated the behavioural changes made by bold and shy rainbow trout, and the magnitude of those changes, in response to predation risk and exposure to two environmental challenges. Behavioural and physiological responses under biotic (either no, predictable or unpredictable predation risk) and abiotic (temperature increase or hypoxia) factors were measured. Boldness was determined using a standard novel object paradigm. In general, after exposure to the treatments, fish exhibited less extreme bold or shy behaviour; the greatest change was observed in fish exposed to hypoxia, or those exposed to high risk particularly in shy fish held at a lower temperature. Higher risk also resulted in increased stress, suggesting that extreme bold or shy behaviour might have been maladaptive under a potential predator threat. These results represent novel evidence that boldness is flexible depending upon particular environmental challenges, with important implications for populations facing environmental extremes caused by anthropogenic activity and climate change.

These effects are rarely explicitly investigated, often due to the assumption that the study animal is habituated to or unaffected by a human's presence. We investigated the effect of human pressure gradients on a remote population of large-headed capuchins, Sapajus macrocephalus, looking specifically at the effects of number of observers, distance to observers, and distance to the research base. We conducted this study over 4 months in the Pacaya-Samiria Nature Reserve, Peru, and collected 199 two-minute focal samples of capuchin behavior. We found that capuchin monkeys fed less when human observers were closer to the focal individual, when more observers were present, and when capuchins were closer to the research base. We found no other consistent differences in capuchin monkey behavior across the measured human pressure gradients, although capuchins directed a high proportion of their vigilance toward humans (29% in adults and 47% in infants). Our results support the hypothesis that human pressure gradients influence animal behavior. Given the proportion of human directed vigilance, we recommend that all studies that use human observers to record animal behavior consider human-directed vigilance, record the number of observers, as well as the observer-focal animal distance, to check for these effects.","[Metcalfe, Chloe Alexia; Papworth, Sarah] Royal Holloway Univ London, Surrey, England; [Yaicurima, Alfredo Yhuaraqui] FundAmazonia, Iquitos, Peru",,"Metcalfe, CA (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Surrey, England.",chloe.metcalfe.2012@live.rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,61,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0164-0291,1573-8604,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

(2) In forested ecosystems, predation risk for small consumers should increase with the intensity of disturbance. (3) For the same level of disturbance. foragers living in higher-quality habitats should protect their assets by investing more in anti-predatory behaviours than those living in low-quality habitats.

Place and time: Twenty-nine pairs of natural and logged habitats sampled during 2006 in managed boreal forest. Province of Quebec, Canada. Methods: We identified a gradient of habitat disturbance along principal components summarizing 12 habitat variables. We estimated competition by measuring the giving-up density of rodents along the gradient of habitat disturbance. We assessed predation risk by measuring the giving-up density of rodents foraging in safe and risky patches. We tested for differences with multi-level statistical modelling. Conclusions: Competition and predation risk increased with habitat disturbance in the boreal forest studied. Foragers living in higher-quality habitats experienced higher predation costs than foragers living in low-quality habitats. Intra- and inter-specific competition, rather than predation, was the main mechanism responsible for the decline of red-backed vole populations associated with forest harvesting.","[Lemaitre, Jerome; Fortin, Daniel] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Darveau, Marcel] Ducks Unlimited Canada, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",,"Lemaitre, J (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jerome.lemaitre.1@ulaval.ca,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020; Lemaitre, Jerome/S-1337-2017","Lemaitre, Jerome/0000-0001-7736-111X",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologiesFQRNT,"This study would not have been possible without the outstanding help of our field assistants, who carried hundreds of filled food patches to experimental sites, counted thousands of sunflower seeds, and collected data on small mammals and habitat variables: L.

Although this may be equally important to other behavioral states for sustaining life, it has not been well studied in the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). This study characterized the bout duration, frequency, and age-sex class differences in diurnal recumbent behavior of free-ranging giraffe. Additionally, it is currently unknown whether giraffe utilize shady or safe areas for diurnal recumbency, as many other animals do. Therefore, we also investigated this in the present study. Data were collected in Katavi National Park, Tanzania, during four time periods. The duration of recumbency bouts was calculated from 170 episodes, and the frequency of recumbency was determined by following 24 individuals for more than 10 h each. Habitat type was categorized into wooded grassland or miombo woodland, and habitat preference was analyzed based on 173.6 h of observations. We found no significant difference in the duration of recumbency bouts among the four age-classes and between sexes in adults. On the other hand, calves (n = 2) rested more frequently than did other age-groups, possibly due to differences in predation risk or activity budgets. Adult males had a higher frequency of recumbency compared to adult females, possibly because pregnant/nursing females were hindered in adopting this posture. We also found that giraffe primarily utilized the miombo woodland for daytime recumbency, likely because the high tree density reduces heat stress, and its seclusion from the river reduces predation risk.","[Saito, M.; Idani, G.] Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Kyoto, Japan",,"Saito, M (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Dept Ethol, Grad Sch Human Sci, 1-2 Yamada Oka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",miho.saito.33@hus.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Idani, Gen'ichi/0000-0003-1608-4440",Leading Graduate Program in Primatology and Wildlife Science [U04-JSPS]; ITP-HOPE; Japan Science Society [28-537];  [17J09785],"The research was financially supported by Leading Graduate Program in Primatology and Wildlife Science (U04-JSPS), ITP-HOPE, the Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society (28-537), and Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Research Fellow (#17J09785).

We compare the morphological and behavioural traits of mammal prey species in the Tai forest, Ivory Coast, with the diet preferences of three of their non-human predators: leopards, chimpanzees and African crowned eagles. Individual predators show marked differences in their predation rates on prey species of different body sizes, but clear patterns with prey behaviour were apparent only when differences in prey habitat use were incorporated into the analyses. Leopard predation rates are highest for terrestrial species living in smaller groups, whereas eagle predation rates are negatively correlated with group size only among arboreal prey. When prey predation rates are summed over all three predators, terrestrial species incur higher predation rates than arboreal species and, within both categories, predation rates decline with increasing prey group size and decreasing density of groups in the habitat. These results reveal that it is necessary to consider anti-predator strategies in the context of a dynamic behavioural interaction between predators and prey.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Populat & Evolut Biol Res Grp, Liverpool L69 3GS, Merseyside, England; Ctr Suisse Rech Sci, Tai Monkey Project, Abidjan 01, Cote Ivoire; Univ Strasbourg 1, Ethol & Ecol Comportamentale Primates, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; Ohio State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Columbus, OH 44906 USA",,"Shultz, S (corresponding author), RSPB, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England.",susanne.shultz@rspb.org.uk,"Shultz, Susanne/C-3162-2012; Noë, Ronald/N-3259-2019; Noë, Ronald/C-4482-2008","Noë, Ronald/0000-0003-1976-0555; Shultz, Susanne/0000-0002-7135-4880",,,,57,78,81,0,34,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In this study, we investigated the role of CRF within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in modulating unconditioned defensive behaviors, by examining the effects of microinfusing cortagine a selective type-1 CRF receptor (CRF1) agonist, or acidic-astressin a preferential CRF1 antagonist, into the mPFC in male CD-1 mice exposed to a live predator (rat exposure test-RET). Cortagine microinfusions significantly reduced several indices of defense, including avoidance and freezing, suggesting a specific role for CRF1 within the infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the mPFC in modulating unconditioned behavioral responsivity to a predator. In contrast, microinfusions of acidic-astressin failed to alter defensive behaviors during predator exposure in the RET. Cortagine microinfusions also reduced Fos protein production in the medial, central and basomedial, but not basolateral subnuclei of the amygdala in mice exposed to the rat predatory threat stimulus. These results suggest that CRF1 activation within the mPFC attenuates predator-induced unconditioned anxiety-like defensive behaviors, likely via inhibition of specific amygdalar nuclei. Furthermore, the present findings suggest that the mPFC represents a unique neural region whereby activation of CRF1 produces behavioral effects that contrast with those elicited following systemic administration of CRF1 agonists.

This reduction in annual fecundity is generally explained as an adaptation either to higher rates of nest predation or to a more limited food supply concurrent with higher adult survival in the tropics. However, the physiological parameters associated with lower annual fecundity in tropical birds have not been well investigated. We compared the annual fecundity, behaviour and a number of physiological parameters of stonechat parents feeding fledged juveniles in territories with and without fiscal shrikes, a predator on adult and fledged birds. Stonechat pairs in territories with shrikes were less likely to initiate a second brood and delayed successive broods compared to pairs in territories without shrikes. After fledging of their young, males showed a greater propensity than females to initiate distraction calls after a human intrusion into their territory and, therefore, invested more in the defence of their young. In territories with shrikes stonechat males had higher initial plasma corticosterone levels and lower body conditions than males in territories without shrikes, suggesting that they were chronically stressed. In contrast, the females from both types of territory had low initial plasma corticosterone levels. We conclude that shrike presence might account for the delay in initiation of a second brood and the reduction in the tendency to initiate a second brood. Whether these effects are mediated by the elevated levels of corticosterone remains to be demonstrated.","Dept Biol Rhythms & Behav, Res Ctr Ornithol Max Planck Soc, D-82346 Andechs, Germany",,"Scheuerlein, A (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, Nat Bridge Rd 8001, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",scheuerlein@umsl.edu,"Scheuerlein, Alexander/AAK-1111-2021",,,,,55,161,162,2,56,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2945,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Here we examine the effects that coexistence with humans may have on the antipredator mechanisms in three species of Liolaemus (Tropiduridae). For each species we compared two populations exposed to different human densities, to test the null hypothesis that there is no interpopulational variation in the response to an approaching human in the field. Also it was determined whether coexistence with humans would affect the behavioral and physiological antipredator responses to a model of a natural predator in the laboratory. Lizard populations that were exposed to a high human density allowed a closer proximity of humans in the field, and decreased their rate of movement and breathing intensity in response to the presentation of a predator model in laboratory experiments. We discuss the effects humans may have upon the lizards antipredator behavior toward humans and natural predators.","Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile",,"Labra, A (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Casilla 114-D, Santiago 6513677, Chile.",,,,,,,40,35,39,0,12,SOC STUDY AMPHIBIANS REPTILES,ST LOUIS,"C/O ROBERT D ALDRIDGE, ST LOUIS UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGY, 3507 LACLEDE, ST LOUIS, MO 63103 USA",0022-1511,,,J HERPETOL,J.

Effective management interventions to help reduce damage must address the varied needs of ranchers by segmenting audiences for more targeted programs. We developed a typology that conceptualized six types of ranchers based on the theory of planned behavior. We posited that rancher types were driven by: attitudes; social norms; perceived control; emotional disposition; risk perception; and contextual factors. To test the typology throughout Costa Rica, we conducted a structured survey of a random sample of 93 ranchers affected by jaguar and puma predation and paired them with a sample of 69 unaffected neighbors. Cluster analyses of survey results provided empirical support for a typology of four types of ranchers, two of which were predicted by the theory of planned behavior: preventive ranchers who take control to prevent felid damage; and helpless ranchers who lack control. We also identified a risk-neutral type who takes no action as they do not perceive the cats as a threat; and a cat-troubled type influenced mainly by negative emotions toward big cats. This last type supports the need to include emotional factors in theoretical frameworks when dealing with human-wildlife conflict. The typology is useful for designing improved policy and management interventions to reduce wildlife conflicts.","[Amit, Ronit; Jacobson, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, 110 Newins Ziegler Hall,POB 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Amit, Ronit] Asociac Confraternidad Guanacasteca, Programa Gente & Fauna, Guanacaste, Costa Rica",,"Jacobson, SK (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, 110 Newins Ziegler Hall,POB 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jaguar.rar@gmail.com,,"Amit, Ronit/0000-0002-4976-4226",Wildlife Without Borders Program at the US Fish and Wildlife Service; Chester Zoo; Cleveland Metroparks Zoo; Panthera Foundation; UF Tropical Conservation and Development; Program for Studies in Tropical Conservation; Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of Florida; Fulbright Faculty Development Program; School of Biology at the University of Costa Rica; Costa Rican Ministry of Environment; National System of Conservation Areas; Wild Cat Conflict Response Unit (UACFel in Spanish); US Department of Interior,"Funds were provided by the Wildlife Without Borders Program at the US Fish and Wildlife Service and US Department of Interior, Chester Zoo, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Panthera Foundation, UF Tropical Conservation and Development, Program for Studies in Tropical Conservation, and Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of Florida.

This suggests that localities at which these animals are active represent a trade-off between suitable habitat and avoidance of potential risk from anthropogenic origins. However, the influence of prey presence was likely underestimated because of the methodology used, and likely weighed in the trade-off as well.","[Wolf, Mosheh; Ale, Som] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci MC 066, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",,"Wolf, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci MC 066, 845 W Taylor St,3352 SES, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",mhwolf@uic.edu,,,"Wildlife Conservation Society; World Wildlife Fund (United States and Nepal); Rufford Small Grants Foundation; International Snow Leopard Trust; Brookfield Zoo; Institute for Wildlife Studies, University of Illinois; Ev-K2degree-CNR Project; Idea Wild; Z.

Social bonds can be considered a type of social relationship characterized by frequent and consistent affiliative (non-reproductive) interactions. Social bonds with conspecifics bring many advantages, also in terms of direct fitness. A characteristic of social bonds is that they need time to develop. Several studies on humans have emphasized the fact that sharing experiences can affect the strength of social bonds. A similar trend can be spotted in non-human species. For example, a recent experiment showed that if chimpanzees watched a video together with a conspecific, they spent more time in proximity compared to conspecifics with whom they did not actively watch a video. Another experiment on fish showed that individuals who experienced a situation of high predation risk together, showed preference for each other compared to those who did not. As the link between shared experiences and social bonds is not explicitly recognized in non-human animals, the main goal of this work is to propose the exploration of this novel research path. This exploration would contribute to shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms of social bond (or friendship) development and maintenance between individuals in different vertebrate species, from fish to non-human primates.","[Busia, Laura] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Sociol & Anthropol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Griggio, Matteo] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Padua, Italy",,"Busia, L (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Sociol & Anthropol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",laura.busia@gmail.com,,"Griggio, Matteo/0000-0002-3298-2905",,,,72,1,1,2,19,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1744-9561,1744-957X,,BIOL LETTERS,Biol.

Several bat species often roost in buildings but while the effects of disturbance inside the roost are well documented, little is known about those occurring in the proximity of roosts. We tested the effects of anthropogenic stressors on bats by monitoring reactions to disturbance in a colony of greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). We assessed disturbance by recording and quantifying the presence of people, domestic cats and noise sources near the roost. Disturbance outside the roost caused the disruption of roosting clusters; when cats entered the roost, bats decreased indoor flight activity. Emergence timing was delayed when people were close to the roost exit, and the delay increased along with the number of people. The occurrence of a cat increased the degree of group clustering during emergence. Cats entered the roost especially when young bats were present, and bat remains occurred in 30% of the cat scats we examined. We show that the occurence of human activities near roosts and free -ranging domestic cats are important albeit overlooked sources of disturbance.","[Ancillotto, L.; Russo, D.] Univ Napoli Federico II, Wildlife Res Unit, Portici, Italy; [Venturi, G.] Univ Parma, Parma, Italy; [Russo, D.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Russo, D (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Portici, Italy.",danrusso@unina.it,,,Barrea city council,"We are grateful to the Barrea city council and particularly to its mayor Andrea Scarnecchia, who supported this work and provided funding; thanks also go to the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park and Biagio Di Loreto for providing assistance during the study, as well as to the association Pro Loco di Barrea for kindly providing accommodation and support during all phases of data collection.

However, factors influencing resting strategies and the degree to which resting strategies are driven by the activities of predators and/or prey remain largely unknown. Our goal was to examine how mammalian resting strategies varied with trophic level, body mass, and habitat. We reviewed findings from 127 publications and classified the resting strategies of terrestrial and aquatic mammalian species into three categories: social (e.g., resting in groups), temporal (e.g., resting during the day), or spatial (e.g., resting in burrows). Temporal strategies were most common (54% of cases), but the prevalence of strategies varied with body mass and among trophic levels. Specifically, lower trophic levels and smaller species such as rodents and lagomorphs used more spatial and social resting strategies, whereas top predators and larger species used mostly temporal resting strategies. Resting strategies also varied among habitat types (e.g., rainforest vs. grassland), but this was primarily because closely related species shared both habitats and resting strategies. Human presence also affected resting strategies at all trophic levels but most strongly influenced top predators through shifts in rest timing. Human-induced behavioral changes in rest patterns cascade to modify behaviors across multiple trophic levels. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of natural history and ecology in wild animals and provide a roadmap for future comparative studies.","[Shukla, Ishana; Kilpatrick, A.

Modeling PTSD is challenging, as it is a heterogeneous disorder with >= 20 symptoms. Clinical research increasingly utilizes objective biological measures (e.g., imaging, peripheral biomarkers) or nonverbal behaviors and/or physiological responses to complement verbally reported symptoms. This shift toward more-objectively measurable phenotypes enables refinement of current animal models of PTSD, and it supports the incorporation of homologous measures across species. We reviewed.600 articles to examine the ability of current rodent models to probe biological phenotypes of PTSD (e.g., sleep disturbances, hippocampal and fear-circuit dysfunction, inflammation, glucocorticoid receptor hypersensitivity) in addition to behavioral phenotypes. Most models reliably produced enduring generalized anxiety-like or depression-like behaviors, as well as hyperactive fear circuits, glucocorticoid receptor hypersensitivity, and response to long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although a few paradigms probed fear conditioning/extinction or utilized peripheral immune, sleep, and noninvasive imaging measures, we argue that these should be incorporated more to enhance translation. Data on female subjects, on subjects at different ages across the life span, or on temporal trajectories of phenotypes after stress that can inform model validity and treatment study design are needed. Overall, preclinical (and clinical) PTSD researchers are increasingly incorporating homologous biological measures to assess markers of risk, response, and treatment outcome. This shift is exciting, as we and many others hope it not only will support translation of drug efficacy from animal models to clinical trials but also will potentially improve predictability of stage II for stage III clinical trials.","[Deslauriers, Jessica; Der-Avakian, Andre; Risbrough, Victoria B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Deslauriers, Jessica; Risbrough, Victoria B.] Vet Affairs Hosp, Ctr Excellence Stress & Mental Hlth, La Jolla, CA USA; [Toth, Mate] Hungarian Acad Sci, Dept Behav Neurobiol, Inst Expt Med, Budapest, Hungary",,"Risbrough, VB (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr,MC0804, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",vrisbrough@ucsd.edu,"Risbrough, Victoria/X-3344-2019; Der-Avakian, Andre/AAI-7734-2020","Toth, Mate/0000-0003-4529-237X; Deslauriers, Jessica/0000-0003-0757-5328","Canadian Institutes of Health Research postdoctoral fellowshipCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Veterans Affairs (VA) Merit AwardUS Department of Veterans Affairs; VA Center of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health Support Grant [BX002558, R01 AA026560, UH2 MH109334]; National Research, Development and Innovation Office Grant [116589]; Bolyai Janos Research FellowshipHungarian Academy of Sciences; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [UH2MH109334] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA026560] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","JD is the recipient of a Canadian Institutes of Health Research postdoctoral fellowship.

However, among primates, small groups sometimes contain several adult males. We evaluate the hypothesis that high predation risk may lead to greater male representation in primate groups, independent of the effect of group size. Male primates are known to be more vigilant than females, and may also be better at detecting potential predators. A comparative test was done using arboreal folivores in three continents, howler monkeys in the Neotropics, colobus monkeys in Africa and langurs in South and Southeast Asia, Howlers and colobus are exposed to predation by large monkey-eating eagles, whereas the langurs are not. We conducted regression analyses on group composition data of single populations and on mean group compositions among populations, and found that the arboreal langurs basically live in groups with only a single adult males whereas groups of howler and colobus monkeys of comparable size have multiple adult males (Fig. 3). Thus, the hypothesis was supported. Several alternative hypotheses do not account for this pattern.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,"VANSCHAIK, CP (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT BIOL ANTHROPOL & ANAT,3705 B ERWIN RD,DURHAM,NC 27705, USA.",,,,,,,96,101,105,2,30,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Increased human pressure on coastal habitats has contributed to the global population decline in waders. Although coastal development can be particularly rapid and poorly regulated in tropical countries, very little research has been conducted to assess the extent of these impacts in the tropics. 2. We examined the potential effects of human disturbance and tourism-related habitat changes on Malaysian plovers breeding on sandy tropical beaches. 3. In 2004 and 2005, we monitored 54 and 79 pairs of Malaysian plovers in the Gulf of Thailand, and used logistic habitat models to identify factors influencing habitat selection and breeding success. These models included variables affected by anthropogenic changes such as human disturbance and vegetation structure, as well as other natural factors such as prey availability and predator densities. We also assessed causes of nest failure and conducted 372 h of behavioural observations to identify mechanisms that relate important habitat variables to plover productivity. 4. Plovers selected wide beaches with low levels of human disturbance that had a low percentage cover of tall trees backing the beach. The likelihood of hatching clutches and fledging chicks was greater in territories with low levels of human disturbance, low conspecific density and high percentage cover of 0.5-5 m tall vegetation backing the beach. 5. Nest monitoring and behavioural observations suggested that heightened vulnerability to tidal inundation, trampling, heat stress, predators and territorial conflicts may have contributed to the results from the habitat models. 6. We conclude that tourism development on Thai beaches affects both habitat availability and productivity of Malaysian plovers by enhancing beach erosion rates, converting medium vegetation into tall monocultures and intensifying human disturbance. These direct effects of habitat loss may be exacerbated by density-dependent reductions in productivity. 7. Synthesis and application. This study demonstrates the value of combining three approaches: habitat modelling, nest monitoring and behavioural observations, for identifying impacts of anthropogenic changes on breeding birds and assigning ultimate causes. In understudied regions where there are pressing threats to wildlife, this approach may focus research efforts so that the necessary data can be obtained rapidly in order to assess and predict human impacts.","Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Marine Protected Areas Res Grp, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada",,"Yasue, M (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Marine Protected Areas Res Grp, POB 3050, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada.",maiyasue@hotmail.com,,,,,,62,41,44,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Due to their high historical, and sometimes present-day, abundances, capability for large-scale movements and high metabolic rates, they have the potential to affect the structure and function of ecosystems through a variety of mechanisms over both ecological and evolutionary time. Usually, the effects of marine mammals on ecosystems are explicitly or implicitly considered to occur through their ability to remove prey through direct predation. Recent empirical studies and a rich theoretical framework, however, demonstrate that marine mammals can affect ecosystems through more diverse pathways, including those that are driven by marine mammal behaviour. Thus, non-consumptive effects of and on marine mammals may be critical in shaping their ecological importance. Non-consumptive effects may include risk effects, whereby predators induce costly changes to prey behaviour that impact prey population sizes or the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of prey impacts on communities (e.g. behaviour-mediated trophic cascades). Changes in the abundance of large apex predators (both marine mammals and sharks) and the introduction of perceived and real risks (human disturbance) may also affect behaviours of marine mammals and their prey that cascade to the wider ecosystem; the conditions under which such cascading effects might be most important, however, remain poorly understood. Other behaviour-driven ecological roles of marine mammals may include foraging tactics that facilitate the foraging of other species (especially seabirds), translocating nutrients and linking the dynamics of spatially distinct food webs.","[Kiszka, Jeremy J.; Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Wirsing, Aaron J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Kiszka, JJ (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",jeremy.kiszka@gmail.com,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020; Kiszka, Jeremy J./AAH-2588-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Kiszka, Jeremy J./0000-0003-1095-8979",,,,170,46,47,5,199,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Although some previous studies performed such an analysis at local to continental scales, the global-scale focus is the most relevant for conservation of the entire species. Here we evaluate information on global population trends of shorebirds, a widely distributed and ecologically diversified group, where some species connect different parts of the world by migration, while others are residents. Nowadays, shorebirds face rapid environmental changes caused by various human activities and climate change. Numerous signs of regional population declines have been recently reported in response to these threats. The aim of our study was to test whether breeding and non-breeding habitats, migratory behaviour (migrants vs. residents) and migration distance, breeding latitude, generation time and breeding range size mirror species' global population trends. We found that a majority of shorebird species have declined globally. After accounting for the influence of traits and species taxonomy, linear mixed-effects models showed that populations of migratory shorebirds decreased more than populations of residents. Besides that, declines were more frequent for species breeding at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, but these patterns did not hold after excluding the non-migratory species. Our findings suggest that factors linked to migration, such as habitat loss as well as deterioration at stop-over or wintering sites and a pronounced climate change impact at high latitudes, are possible drivers of the observed worldwide population decreases.","[Kolecek, Jaroslav; Reif, Jiri; Hanzelka, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Studies, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic; [Reif, Jiri] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Lab Ornithol, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Salek, Miroslav] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sottas, Camille] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kubelka, Vojtech] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Kubelka, Vojtech] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Dept Biodivers Res, Brno, Czech Republic; [Kubelka, Vojtech] Univ Debrecen, Fac Sci, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, Debrecen, Hungary; [Kubelka, Vojtech] Univ Bath, Milner Ctr Evolut, Bath, Avon, England",,"Kolecek, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Inst Environm Studies, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic.",j.kolecek@gmail.com,"Kole?ek, Jaroslav/F-9646-2014; Kubelka, Vojtech/M-3993-2014; Reif, Jiri/I-9168-2017","Kole?ek, Jaroslav/0000-0003-1069-6593; Salek, Miroslav/0000-0002-8238-3644; Kubelka, Vojtech/0000-0002-5015-5890; Reif, Jiri/0000-0003-2553-7333","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [20-00648S]; Charles University [PRIMUS/17/SCI/16]; UNCE program [UNCE/SCI/005]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic MSMT CRMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LH13278, CZ.02.2.69/0.0/0.0/19_ 074/0014459]; Hungarian government [ELVONAL-KKP 126949]","J.K. and J.R. were supported by the Czech Science Foundation (20-00648S) and by the Charles University (PRIMUS/17/SCI/16).

However, accumulating field data on juvenile primates suggest variation in the linkages between foraging efficiency, group foraging and social behaviour. In many non-human primates, juvenile ability (strength, coordination and motor skills) does not limit foraging success. If predicted limitations in feeding are not found in juvenile monkeys, it is possible that the gregarious strepsirrhines may show foraging patterns similar to those implicated in the evolution of a life history where long juvenile periods are advantageous. To test these behavioural predictions, I present a mixed longitudinal sample of observations on feeding and foraging behaviour from ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at the Reza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. Like several platyrrhine species, close proximity during foraging, low feeding efficiency and low dietary diversity are not typical of ring-tailed lemurs. The lack of ecological trade-offs in these species may indicate stronger common roles of sociality and social complexity in structuring the elongation of the primate juvenile period. (C) 2015 S.

Parasites can have significant behavioral effects even when parasitism is sub-clinical with these effects proposed to either benefit the parasite (parasite 'manipulation'), benefit the host, or to simply arise as side-effects of the infection (parasitic 'constraints'). However, until relatively recently little attention has been paid to the neuromodulatory substrates that mediate these behavioral changes. Ethopharmacology incorporates an evolutionary approach to the study of behavior with pharmacological analysis of neuromodulatory mechanisms. As such, this approach is appropriate for, and has been applied to, the analysis of the effects of ectoparasites (e.g. biting and blood-feeding flies) and endoparasites (e.g. protozoa, nematodes) on a number of behaviors (e.g. pain inhibition, learning and memory, responses to predators and anxiety, mate selection) in selected host-parasite systems. Ethopharmacology suggests a promising direction by which neuromodulatory mechanisms that underlie the effects of parasites on behavior, including that of humans, can be addressed.

Our aim was to investigate the relative importance of maximizing visibility to females (hotspot hypothesis) versus minimizing predation risk (predation avoidance hypothesis). Using a geographic information system, a very high-resolution digital elevation model, and an extensive survey database, we compared the 350 lek centers known in Spain with randomly generated sites. Males preferred lek sites that increase their visibility to surrounding females, reduce the distance to them, enhance the probability of detecting predators, and increase the distance to human disturbance sources. Logistic regression analyses confirmed these patterns. A final model identified five relevant variables indicative of higher short-range visibility, more centered location with respect to females, and farther distance to human disturbance sources in lek centers compared with random points. The viewshed gain of lek centers relative to random points was maximal at the center and disappeared gradually at randomly generated replicas located progressively farther away from the center, but still within a buffer equivalent to the home range of the male flock during the display period. Visibility maximization may be the reason why lek centers are extremely fixed within and between consecutive breeding seasons. Our results are compatible with both hotspot and predation avoidance hypotheses. We suggest that both models are important, at least for species displaying in open habitats.

The present investigation confirmed earlier findings with each test providing a distinct behavioral profile following exposure to predator stimuli. In addition, the data showed a consistent gender difference in a number of these behavioral measures, indicating that females are more defensive than males. These effects included reliably higher levels of cat avoidance and crouching, with lower levels of transits, lying and drinking for cat-exposed females. Similarly, females exposed to a cat odor stimulus showed a reliably higher level of stretch attend and flat back approach behaviors (risk assessment) towards the stimulus block. The 5-HT2 antagonist, ritanserin, failed to provide significant indication of anxiolytic activity, and had minimal influence on antipredator defensive behavior. An important exception to this profile was a reliable decrease in stretch attend behavior to a cat odor stimulus in females but not males. Overall, these findings suggest a complex relationship between gender, antipredator defensive behavior, and anxiolytic drug treatment.","UNIV HAWAII,BEKESY LAB NEUROBIOL,1993 E W RD,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,JOHN A BURNS SCH MED,DEPT ANAT & REPROD BIOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV HAWAII,DEPT PSYCHOL,HONOLULU,HI 96822; UNIV LEEDS,DEPT PSYCHOL,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND",,,,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH042803] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCRR NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR01825, RR03061] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH42803] Funding Source: Medline",,,29,48,48,1,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0031-9384,,,PHYSIOL BEHAV,Physiol.

We examined the impact of viewing activities on the behaviour of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in coastal British Columbia. Domination of the best feeding sites and human avoidance by large male bears has consistently been reported. We, however, saw displacement in time rather than space - during the viewing day large males were less active than at other times, while females cubs tended to be more active. In each year, females with cubs spent similarly high proportions of their time fishing when people were present. In years with, large male activity, less time was spent fishing when people were absent. When freed from the potential threat of large male be, females with cubs showed no measurable impact of controlled human activity. Human presence at a feeding site impacts the behaviour of brown bears, but not as expected. Temporal avoidance of hurt activity by large males was observed; indications that they departed upon satiation, before the arrival of morning tours, however suggests that there was little energetic impact. By displacing large males, viewing activities created a temporal refuge, enhancing feeding opportunities for subordinate age/sex classes. With the strong positive relationships between mean female mass and lit size, this may in turn increase population productivity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Wildlife managers often use FID when seeking to develop set-back distances to reduce human impacts on wildlife. Economic models of escape behavior predict that escape decisions will be dynamic and will be influenced by both the costs and benefits of remaining. In contrast, wildlife managers often aim to generate a single set back distance for each species. While a number of factors are acknowledged to influence FID, the starting distance between the observer and the animal is typically ignored in FID studies. For 64 of 68 species of Australian birds, I found a significant positive relationship between starting distance and FID. This demonstrates that, as predicted by economic models, species generally assess risk dynamically and flush at a greater distance as starting distances increase. My finding is consistent with the idea that animals accrue an attentional cost for continued monitoring of an approaching predator. Researchers or managers aiming to quantify human impact using FID should use starting distance as a covariate.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Organism Biol Ecol & Evolut, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Organism Biol Ecol & Evolut, 621 Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012; Jenkins, Stephanie/F-5216-2011","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244; ",,,,15,308,323,14,156,WILDLIFE SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2197 USA",0022-541X,,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Among other factors, prior studies have shown that latitude explains significant variation in avian FID: at lower latitudes, individuals and species have longer FIDs than those living at higher latitudes. No prior studies have focused on the effect of elevation on FID. Given the similar patterns of seasonality, climate, and potentially predator density, that covary between latitude and elevation, birds at higher elevations might tolerate closer approaches. We asked whether elevation or latitude would explain more variation in the FID of a common passerine bird species, dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis). Juncos live in a variety of habitats along both latitudinal and elevational gradients. We found that statistical models containing elevation as a variable explained more of the variation in FID than did models containing latitude. We also found, unexpectedly, that birds at higher elevation fled at greater distances. While more predators were sighted per hour at higher elevations than at lower elevations, the frequency of predator sightings did not explain a significant amount of variation in FID. This result questions whether predator density is the main driver of risk perception along elevational gradients. Nonetheless, because elevation explains more variation in FID than latitude in at least one species, these findings have direct implications on how human impacts on birds are managed. Specifically, those designing set-back zones to reduce human impact on birds may consider modifying them based on both latitude and elevation.","[Andrade, Madelin; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,,Pasadena Audubon Society; UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; White Mountain Research Center; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This work was generously supported by grants to M.A. from: the Pasadena Audubon Society, the UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and the White Mountain Research Center.

We set out to identify sources of variation in the spatial distribution of hunter effort by ring-necked pheasant Phasianus colchicus hunters during two time periods representing different spatial decisions: where to access a hunting location at the start of a hunt and where to hunt within it for the duration of the hunt. Pheasant hunters used direct and indirect information about the availability and accessibility of pheasants to make spatial decisions throughout their hunts, but the sources of information used at the beginning of hunts differed from those used for the duration of hunts. Hunter access point effort at the start of hunts was positively associated with proximity to public access signs and declined near marked safety zones around occupied structures and livestock, indicating that hunters responded to the spatial distribution and information content of public access infrastructure. Hunter effort within fields for the duration of hunts was positively related to predicted pheasant habitat use and negatively associated with correlates of physical exertion and increasing distance from field edges. Our findings indicate that hunters in the field are making spatial decisions in response to information about public land access, their own physical state, and perceived opportunity to encounter pheasants. Our results further suggest managers may be able to optimize public lands for wildlife habitat and recreational value without imposing new regulations by managing the information provided to hunters.","[Wszola, Lyndsie S.; Stuber, Erica F.; Fontaine, Joseph J.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Nebraska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 420 Hardin Hall,3310 Holdrege St, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Chizinski, Christopher J.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Lusk, Jeffrey J.] Nebraska Game & Pk Commiss, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Wszola, LS (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Nebraska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 420 Hardin Hall,3310 Holdrege St, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",lyndsie.wszola@huskers.unl.edu,"Stuber, Erica/AAT-2803-2020","Stuber, Erica/0000-0002-2687-6874",Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Projects [W-98-R],"Funding for this project was provided by Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Projects W-98-R, administered by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.",,69,2,2,0,1,WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,RONDE,"C/O JAN BERTELSEN, GRENAAVEJ 14, KALO, DK-8410 RONDE, DENMARK",0909-6396,1903-220X,,WILDLIFE BIOL,Wildlife Biol.,,2019,,,,,,,,,wlb.00526,10.2981/wlb.00526,,,9,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,KR6XH,WOS:000517759800001,,gold,,,2022-04-19,

Most studies focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of predators alternately causes increases and decreases in abundances of lower trophic levels. However, cascades could also be driven by where and when prey forage rather than solely by prey abundance. Over a large gradient of fishing intensity in the central Pacific's remote northern Line Islands, including a nearly pristine, baseline coral reef system, we found that changes in predation risk elicit strong behavioral responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey fish species. These responses were observed as a function of both short-term (acute'') risk and longer-term (chronic'') risk, as well as when prey were exposed to model predators to isolate the effect of perceived predation risk from other potentially confounding factors. Compared to numerical prey responses, antipredator behavioral responses such as these can potentially have far greater net impacts (by occurring over entire assemblages) and operate over shorter temporal scales (with potentially instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects. A rich body of literature exists on both the direct effects of human removal of predators from ecosystems and predators' effects on prey behavior. Our results draw together these lines of research and provide the first empirical evidence that large-scale human removal of predators from a natural ecosystem indirectly alters prey behavior. These behavioral changes may, in turn, drive previously unsuspected alterations in reef food webs.","[Madin, Elizabeth M.

Translocations, perceived as humane and non-lethal solutions, are increasingly advocated to resolve these conflicts. The present study summarises the literature on translocations of wild mammals, with particular emphasis on 'problem' animals, reviews the impact of translocations on survival, behaviour, animal welfare and potential spread of diseases, and evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of translocations to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. Translocations may have a detrimental impact on survival rates and lead to extreme dispersal movements. In some species, stress-related capture results in substantial mortality. In other species, homing causes animals to leave the release area. In addition, some animals resume the nuisance behaviour at the release site. Individuals that survive a translocation may suffer from malnutrition, dehydration, decreased immunocompetence and predation. Supportive measures such as acclimatisation pens and provision of food and shelter can drastically reduce post-release dispersal movements and mortality, although the adoption of these measures increases the cost of translocation. Translocations have the potential to spread diseases to conspecifics, humans, domestic animals and livestock. Health surveillance, seldom implemented, is likely to add significantly to the cost of translocation. Very few studies have reported the costs of translocations or addressed which stakeholders are expected to pay for translocating problem animals. Alternative management options are rarely mentioned. Despite the perceived humaneness of translocations to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, the fate of translocated animals has been rarely monitored. In addition, very few studies have mentioned whether and for how long the conflict was resolved. We suggest that determining whether the translocation leads to the resolution of the problem should be the main criterion to evaluate the success of the translocation of problem animals. We propose a list of criteria to assist decisions regarding the suitability, effectiveness and humaneness of translocations to manage problems posed by wild mammals.","[Massei, Giovanna; Quy, Roger J.; Gurney, Joanne; Cowan, Dave P.] Food & Environm Res Agcy, York Y041 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England",,"Massei, G (corresponding author), Food & Environm Res Agcy, York Y041 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England.",giovanna.massei@fera.gsi.gov.uk,"Whitehead, Joanne/AAM-6803-2020; Massei, Giovanna/B-8781-2016",,"DefraDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) [WM0304]",The study was funded by Defra under project WM0304.

Whereas the harmful effects of UVB on aquatic organisms are well studied at the molecular and cellular level, recent studies have also begun to address behavioural changes caused by sublethal amounts of UVB. However, the behavioural consequences of long-term exposure to ecologically relevant UVB levels over several life stages are virtually unknown, particularly with regard to predator-prey behaviour. We found increased predator-inspection behaviour together with a smaller body length in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) after fish were exposed for about seven months to natural sunlight conditions with enhanced UVB, compared with full siblings exposed to natural sunlight only. The observed change in antipredator behaviour may reflect a direct behavioural response mediated through UVB-induced oxidative stress during development. Alternatively, the smaller body size in UVB-exposed fish may result in an increased inspection effort allowing them to spend more time foraging. Our findings suggest that, within the scope of environmental change, UVB radiation constitutes an important stress factor by eliciting behavioural responses that influence crucial ecological processes, such as predator-prey interactions.","[Vitt, Simon; Zierul, Janina E.; Bakker, Theo C.

Similar bonds can be found in a wide range of taxa, revealing the evolutionary origins of humans' social bonds. Evidence suggests that these strong social bonds can function to buffer the negative effects of living in groups, but it is not known whether they also function to minimize predation risk. Here, we show that crested macaques (Macaca nigra) react more strongly to playbacks of recruitment alarm calls (i.e. calls signalling the presence of a predator and eliciting cooperative mobbing behaviour) if they were produced by an individual with whom they share a strong social bond. Dominance relationships between caller and listener had no effect on the reaction of the listener. Thus, strong social bonds may improve the coordination and efficiency of cooperative defence against predators, and therefore increase chances of survival. This result broadens our understanding of the evolution and function of social bonds by highlighting their importance in the anti-predator context.","[Micheletta, Jerome; Waller, Bridget M.] Univ Portsmouth, Ctr Comparat & Evolutionary Psychol, Dept Psychol, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Micheletta, Jerome; Panggur, Maria R.; Neumann, Christof; Duboscq, Julie; Engelhardt, Antje] German Primate Ctr, Jr Res Grp Primate Sexual Select, Reprod Biol Unit, Gottingen, Germany; [Panggur, Maria R.; Agil, Muhammad] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Bogor, West Java, Indonesia; [Neumann, Christof; Duboscq, Julie; Engelhardt, Antje] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Evolut Social Behav, Gottingen, Germany; [Neumann, Christof] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Jr Res Grp Primate Kin Select, Dept Primatol, Leipzig, Germany; [Neumann, Christof] Univ Leipzig, Fac Biosci Pharm & Psychol, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Duboscq, Julie] Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Dept Ecol, Strasbourg, France",,"Micheletta, J (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Ctr Comparat & Evolutionary Psychol, Dept Psychol, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",jerome.micheletta@port.ac.uk,"Engelhardt, Antje/A-2660-2013; Micheletta, Jérôme/E-4699-2014","Micheletta, Jérôme/0000-0002-4480-6781; Engelhardt, Antje/0000-0003-2704-7493; Neumann, Christof/0000-0002-0236-1219; Duboscq, Julie/0000-0002-6342-6709; Waller, Bridget/0000-0001-6303-7458","University of Portsmouth, Department of Psychology; Saxon State Ministry for Science and the Arts; German Research Council (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [EN 719/2]; Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Primate Conservation Inc","We thank three anonymous reviewers and the editors for their valuable comments.

Large carnivores are ambassador species, and as such they can aid the protection of a wide range of species, including evolutionarily distinct and threatened ones, while being popular for conservation marketing. However, conflicts between carnivores and people present a considerable challenge to biodiversity conservation. Our cross disciplinary essay brings together original research to discuss key issues in the conservation of large carnivores as keystone species for biodiversity rich, healthy ecosystems. Our findings suggest the need to promote coexistence through challenging 'wilderness' myths; to consider coexistence/conflict as a continuum; to include varied interest groups in decision making; to address fear through positive mediated experiences, and to explore further partnerships with zoos. As wide-reaching institutions visited by over 700 million people/ year worldwide, zoos combine knowledge, emotion and social context creating ideal conditions for the development of care towards nature, pro-environmental behaviors and long-term connections between visitors and carnivores. Based on current research, we provide evidence that large carnivores and zoos are both powerful catalysts for public engagement with biodiversity conservation, recognizing barriers and suggesting future ways to collaborate to address biodiversity loss.","[Consorte-McCrea, Adriana] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Ecol Res Grp, North Holmes Rd, Canterbury CT1 1QU, Kent, England; [Fernandez, Ana] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Sch Psychol Polit & Sociol, North Holmes Rd, Canterbury CT1 1QU, Kent, England; [Bainbridge, Alan] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Educ, North Holmes Rd, Canterbury CT1 1QU, Kent, England; [Moss, Andrew] Chester Zoo, Sci Dept, Conservat, Caughall Rd, Chester CH2 1LH, Cheshire, England; [Prevot, Anne-Caroline] Sorbonne Univ, CESCO, UMR 7204, Museum Natl Hist Nat, 61 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Clayton, Susan] Coll Wooster, Dept Psychol, 930 Coll Mall, Wooster, OH 44691 USA; [Glikman, Jenny Anne] San Diego Zoo Globate, Community Engagement, 2920 Zoo Dr, San Diego, CA 92101 USA; [Johansson, Maria] Lund Univ, Environm Psychol, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Solvegatan 24,Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Vicente Lopez-Bao, Jose] Oviedo Univ, UO CSIC PA, Res Unit Biodivers, C Gonzalo Gutierrez Quiros S-N, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Bath, Alistair] Mem Univ, Dept Geog, Sci Bldg,235 Elizabeth Ave, St John, NF, Canada; [Frank, Beatrice] Univ Victoria, 490 Atkins Ave, Victoria, BC V9B 2Z8, Canada; [Marchini, Silvio] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Tubney OX13 5QL, England",,"Consorte-McCrea, A (corresponding author), Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Ecol Res Grp, North Holmes Rd, Canterbury CT1 1QU, Kent, England.",adriana.consorte-mccrea@canterbury.ac.uk,"Frank, Beatrice/AAZ-2407-2021; Gilkman, Jenny/AAA-2814-2020","Frank, Beatrice/0000-0002-4326-2567; Marchini, Silvio/0000-0002-8184-1631; Glikman, Jenny Anne/0000-0002-0208-5488; Consorte-McCrea, Adriana/0000-0003-0432-0944; Bainbridge, Alan/0000-0001-7783-7747; Fernandez, Ana/0000-0001-5077-0407","Futures Initiative, CCCU; Ramon & Cajal program from the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [RYC-2015-18932]","Adriana Consorte-McCrea, Ana Fernandez and Alan Bainbridge would like to thank the Futures Initiative, CCCU, without whose funding and support the symposium Large carnivores and zoos as catalysts for biodiversity conservation: how do we engage the public in the protection of biodiversity? at ECCB 2018, which formed the basis for the development of this paper, wouldn't have been possible.

By analyzing the circumstances of cheek pouch use, we tested two hypotheses for the evolution of cercopithecine cheek pouches proposed in earlier studies: (1) cheek pouches reduce vulnerability to predation, and (2) cheek pouches increase feeding efficiency by reducing competition. We studied two groups of wild blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni) in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya, conducting focal observations of feeding individuals. Monkeys were less exposed while emptying their cheek pouches than filling them, supporting the predation-avoidance hypothesis. We investigated several measures of competitive threat, but only one supported the competition-reduction hypothesis: when the nearest neighbor's rank increased, subjects were more likely to increase than to decrease cheek pouch use. Overall, our findings supported the predation-avoidance hypothesis more strongly than the competition-reduction hypothesis. We suggest that variation in cheek pouch use may reflect differing behavioral strategies used by cercopithecines to mitigate competition and predation, as well as factors such as resource size and distribution, home range size, and travel patterns.

Functional landscape connectivity for such species influences the spatial distribution of associated ecological services and disservices. We studied how spatio-temporal variation in the risk-resource trade-off, generated by fluctuations in human activities and environmental conditions, influences the routine movements of roe deer across a heterogeneous landscape, generating shifts in functional connectivity at daily and seasonal time scales. We used GPS locations of 172 adult roe deer and step selection functions to infer landscape connectivity. In particular, we assessed the influence of six habitat features on fine scale movements across four biological seasons and three daily periods, based on variations in the risk-resource trade-off. The influence of habitat features on roe deer movements was strongly dependent on proximity to refuge habitat, i.e. woodlands. Roe deer confined their movements to safe habitats during daytime and during the hunting season, when human activity is high. However, they exploited exposed open habitats more freely during night-time. Consequently, we observed marked temporal shifts in landscape connectivity, which was highest at night in summer and lowest during daytime in autumn. In particular, the onset of the autumn hunting season induced an abrupt decrease in landscape connectivity. Human disturbance had a strong impact on roe deer movements, generating pronounced spatio-temporal variation in landscape connectivity. However, high connectivity at night across all seasons implies that Europe's most abundant and widespread large herbivore potentially plays a key role in transporting ticks, seeds and nutrients among habitats.","[Martin, Jodie; Cargnelutti, Bruno; Chaval, Yannick; Lourtet, Bruno; Hewison, A.

Behavioural ecology theory predicts that sensitivity to mortality risks, and thereby to disturbance, will be related to life-history characteristics. Long-lived species with low reproductive rates are expected to have a high cost of predation and therefore avoid risks strongly. In this paper we quantify the effect of roads on the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) using behavioural indicators. We used a pair wise design, offering condors standardized food patches near and far from roads simultaneously The patches consisted of dead adult shee We recorded. p. condors' behaviour when visiting each patch. This study establishes the versatility of behavioural indicators and their usefulness to study conservation problems. We found that, although near and far patches were discovered after similar times and there were similar numbers of condors in the vicinity of near and far patches, the use of patches differed strongly. In the patches far from roads many more condors came to feed, the average time spent per individual was longer, the proportion of time spent vigilant was lower, and the amount of food left uneaten on the carcasses was lower. These results strongly suggest that Andean condors clearly avoid roads, and behave in a way predicted from theory if they trade off safety for energy. This study shows that roads have stronger influence on the habitat use of Andean condors, than previously thought, and may be a significant problem for the species in populated areas.

As wolf pups pass this entire period at either the den or rendezvous sites, their selection by wolf packs may affect pup survival and recruitment. Rendezvous sites are important for pup survival as they are used during summer and early autumn, when intense human activity may increase pup mortality. Adult wolves and pups can be killed by livestock guarding dogs during summer and intentionally or accidentally during large game hunting in autumn. This study describes factors related to rendezvous site selection in order to enhance their protection and management. We studied the rendezvous site selection of 30 wolf packs in central and northern Greece between 1998 and 2010, after locating 35 sites using the simulated howling survey method and telemetry. We considered a series of environmental and anthropogenic predictors of wolf rendezvous site selection at two spatial scales. At the landscape-population scale, wolves selected rendezvous sites below 1,200 m asl, with large inter-site distance (mean, 12.9 km), and avoided partially forested or open habitats, indicating preference for covered, spaced areas with seasonally stable resources. At the home range scale, wolves selected rendezvous sites away from forest roads and villages, close to water sources, and in areas with low forest fragmentation, indicating avoidance of human presence and disturbance. In the summer of 2011, we used an ensuing resource selection model (RSF, AUC = 0.818) to successfully locate seven new rendezvous sites outside our previous survey area, verifying the utility of prediction maps (all new sites were at areas with 0.8-1 model probability). Rendezvous prediction maps can be used to reduce field effort when monitoring wolf populations, assess livestock predation risk, design protected areas, and reduce human disturbance on reproductive wolf packs.","[Iliopoulos, Yorgos] CALLISTO Wildlife Soc, Thessaloniki 54621, Greece; [Iliopoulos, Yorgos; Youlatos, Dionisios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Zool, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Sgardelis, Stefanos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Ecol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece",,"Iliopoulos, Y (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Zool, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",yiliop2@gmail.com,"Youlatos, Dionisios/C-2150-2008","Youlatos, Dionisios/0000-0001-8276-727X",CALLISTO NGO; E.C DG Env.; Greek Ministry of Agriculture; Arcturos NGO; Egnatia odos S.A; Ergose; Argyropoulos SA; Exergia S.A.,"The authors would like to thank I.

The results showed that individual vigilance significantly decreased with group size in all-female groups but not in all-males or mixed-sex groups. In rutting season, males compete with one another and harass females, and we argue that vigilance is partly aimed at threatening males and that such vigilance increases with group size. This explains why overall vigilance did not vary with group size for males in general and for females in mixed-sex groups. Vigilance increased in more disturbed areas but in in male deer only. The results indicate that despite relaxed predation pressure over centuries, Pere David's deer can still adjust antipredator responses as a function of perceived risk. Such information may become useful in the rewilding programme now under way for this species in China [Current Zoology 59 (2): 265-270, 2013].","[Zheng, Wei; Li, Zhongqiu; Yang, Qinglong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Beauchamp, Guy] Univ Montreal, Fac Vet Med, St Hyacinthe, PQ J2S 7C6, Canada; [Jiang, Xuelei] Nanjing Univ, Jinling Coll, Nanjing 210089, Peoples R China",,"Li, ZQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",lizq0314@gmail.com,"Li, Zhong-qiu/A-1748-2011","Li, Zhong-qiu/0000-0003-2004-293X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31000174, J1103512]","Financial support for this work was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31000174 & No. J1103512).

Amphibian tadpoles show rapid and sustained behavioral inhibition when exposed to chemical cues of predation. Here we show that an alarm pheromone is produced by ranid tadpole skin cells, is released into the medium via an active secretory process upon predator attack, and signals predator presence to conspecifics. The pheromone is composed of two components with distinct biophysical properties that must be combined to elicit the behavioral response. In addition to the behavioral response, exposure to the alarm pheromone caused rapid and strong suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as evidenced by a time and dose-dependent decrease in whole body corticosterone content Reversing the decline in endogenous corticosterone caused by exposure to the alarm pheromone through addition of corticosterone to the aquarium water (50 nM) partially blocked the anti-predator behavior, suggesting that the suppression of the HPA axis promotes the expression and maintenance of a behaviorally quiescent state. To our knowledge this is the first evidence for aquatic vertebrate prey actively secreting an alarm pheromone in response to predator attack. We also provide a neuroendocrine mechanism by which the behavioral inhibition caused by exposure to the alarm pheromone is maintained until the threat subsides. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies have compared the relative effects of two or more stressors on this response. We compared how low food abundance and hunting affected levels of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM), an indicator of stress, in Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada). We monitored monthly FGM levels over a year on three islands: on two, there was no hunting but deer were exposed to increased risk of severe food depletion; and on one, deer had access to abundant food but were exposed to a few days of hunting each year. Based on the context of the study, we tentatively predicted that FGM levels would be higher in low food abundance/safe islands. We also predicted that FGM levels would be higher in winter when food is rarer, particularly in low food abundance/safe islands. The three deer populations presented similar average FGM levels and seasonal variations. Our predictions were therefore not supported. Our results rather suggested that environmental contrasts, perceived by us as large (increased risk of starvation on ELI and Kunga islands) or associated with differences in animal behavior (human avoidance on Reef island), did not lead to increased stress responses. We discuss plausible explanations, including the down-regulation of the stress response in depleted environments and the lack of stress response to low hunting pressure when behavioral responses to risk are unlikely to be costly.","[Le Saout, Soizic; Massouh, Marlene; Martin, Jean-Louis; Chamaille-Jammes, Simon] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE,CEFE UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Presseault-Gauvin, Helene] Univ Sherbrooke, Canada Res Chair Evolutionary Demog & Conservat, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Poilve, Eva; Picot, Denis; Verheyden, Helene] INRA, CEFS UR 035, 24 Chemin Borde Rouge,BP CS 52627, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Cote, Steeve D.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Cote, Steeve D.] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",,"Chamaille-Jammes, S (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, EPHE,CEFE UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",simon.chamaille@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Chamaillé-Jammes, Simon/B-3833-2009; Martin, Jean-Louis/E-5059-2010","Chamaillé-Jammes, Simon/0000-0003-0505-6620; ",Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [2010-BLAN-1718]; Groupement de Recherche International Dynamique de la biodiversite et traits d'histoire de vie; Government of CanadaCGIAR,"This project was funded by the project 2010-BLAN-1718 (BAMBI) of the Agence Nationale de la Recherche.

Defensive behaviors were assessed during exposure to cat-odor and a live cat, and immediately following the presentation of footshock. Conditioned defensive behaviors were also assessed in each context 24 h after initial threat exposure. During both unconditioned and conditioned trials, dorsal hippocampal lesions failed to significantly alter any behavioral measure in each test of defense. In contrast, ventral hippocampal lesions significantly reduced unconditioned defensive behaviors during exposure to cat-odor without producing any observable effects during cat exposure. Furthermore, ventral lesions significantly attenuated conditioned defensive behaviors following the administration of footshock and during re-exposure to each context.

Wildlife feeding may also cause animals to develop aggressive behaviors toward conspecifics and people. The risks to humans is potentially accrued when the species is a native predator. Food-based attraction has been implicated in the development of human-directed aggression in the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) population on Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia. Management strategies such as education programs, prohibition of inappropriate human behaviors, and fencing of garbage dumps have been implemented to stop the (intentional or inadvertent) feeding of dingoes by people. Despite these efforts, dingoes continue to obtain human-sourced food, suggesting that other means of supplemental feeding are still available. One possible source of subsidized food is recreational fishing, which is a popular activity on the island. We conducted a quasi-experimental study during May-June 2014 of dingo foraging behaviors on the eastern beach of Fraser Island. We video-recorded the behaviors of lone and groups of dingoes when they were in the vicinity of anglers or by themselves. We hypothesized that if recreational fishing was a source of subsidies to dingoes, then there would be differences in dingo foraging behavior among the 2 groups. We found that in the absence of anglers, dingoes spent 81% of their time engaged in mobile food-related behaviors. When anglers were present, however, they spent 52% of their time sitting and resting. These results suggest that dingoes shifted from active searching to a sit and wait foraging mode upon detecting recreational anglers. We observed an event in which a dingo spent 2hours resting near an angler, then dug up the fish remains buried by the man as soon as he had left the area. This and other anecdotal evidence support the view that the changes in dingo foraging activity detected in this study were related to increased opportunities to secure food from anglers. Recreational fishing may play an important role in the inadvertent subsidizing of dingoes on Fraser Island, although further investigations are needed before proposing and implementing additional conservation and management actions.

We advocate for further research in the role of recreational fishing in the development of negative dingo-human interactions.","[Deaux, Eloise C.; Crowe, Trent] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Charrier, Isabelle] Univ Paris 11, Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, UMR 9197,Inst Neurosci Paris Saclay, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Deaux, Eloise C.] Univ Neuchatel, Ctr Cognit Sci, Rue Emile Argand 11, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",,"Deaux, EC (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.; Deaux, EC (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Ctr Cognit Sci, Rue Emile Argand 11, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",eloise.deaux@gmail.com,"Deaux, Eloise/N-8748-2017","Deaux, Eloise/0000-0002-3150-8267; CHARRIER, Isabelle/0000-0003-4873-2342",Hermon Slade Foundation [9201300442]; Macquarie University; CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission,"We thank the QPWS and EHP for permission to work on the Island.

To model the heterogeneity of PTSD behavioral responses, we exposed male Sprague-Dawley rats to predator scent stress once for 10 min and then assessed anxiety-like behavior 7 days later using the elevated plus maze and acoustic startle response. Rats displaying anxiety-like behavior in both tasks were classified as stress Susceptible, and rats exhibiting behavior no different from un-exposed Controls were classified as stress Resilient. In Resilient rats, we previously found increased mRNA expression of mGlu5 in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and CB1 in the amygdala. Here, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine the subregion and cell-type-specific expression of these genes in Resilient rats 3 weeks after TMT exposure. Resilient rats displayed increased mGlu5 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the PFC and increased BLA CB1 mRNA. These increases were limited to glutamatergic cells. To test the necessity of mGlu5 for attenuating TMT-conditioned contextual fear 3 weeks after TMT conditioning, intra-BLA infusions of the mGlu5 negative allosteric modulator MTEP were administered prior to context re-exposure. In TMT-exposed Resilient rats, but not Controls, MTEP increased freezing on the day of administration, which extinguished over two additional un-drugged sessions. These results suggest that increased mGlu5 expression in BLA glutamate neurons contributes to the behavioral flexibility observed in stress-Resilient animals by facilitating a capacity for extinguishing contextual fear associations.","[Shallcross, John; Wu, Lizhen; Wilkinson, Courtney S.; Knackstedt, Lori A.; Schwendt, Marek] Univ Florida, Psychol Dept, Behav & Cognit Neurosci Program, 114 Psychol Bldg,945 Ctr Dr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wilkinson, Courtney S.; Knackstedt, Lori A.; Schwendt, Marek] Univ Florida, Ctr Addict Res & Educ, Gainesville, FL USA",,"Schwendt, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Psychol Dept, Behav & Cognit Neurosci Program, 114 Psychol Bldg,945 Ctr Dr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Schwendt, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ctr Addict Res & Educ, Gainesville, FL USA.",schwendt@ufl.edu,,,"McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida; Institute on Molecular Neuroscience [8738sc, 9250sc]; Center for OCD, Anxiety, and Related Disorders (COARD) at the University of Florida; CTSAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [TL1TR001428, UL1TR001427];  [W81XWH-12-2-0048]","The authors thank Jason Dee, Stephen Beaudin-Curley and Doug Smith for their assistance with image acquisition and analysis.

Such nonconsumptive effects may be as strong or stronger than consumptive predator effects. However, evidence for this in large terrestrial vertebrate systems is equivocal and few studies quantify the actual fitness costs of nonconsumptive effects. Here, we investigated whether nonconsumptive effects elicited by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), a large terrestrial predator, reduced survival in an ungulate prey, the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). To reveal the behavioral processes underlying nonconsumptive effects, we distinguished between proactive risk avoidance of areas with high lynx encounter probability, and reactive risk avoidance in response to actual lynx encounters and analyzed these responses using step selection functions. We also quantified the consequences of these behaviors for deer survival. Deer reacted differently at day and at night, but avoided high-risk areas proactively during the day and at night in the summer. During a predator encounter, deer increased avoidance of high-risk areas at night but not during the day. Thus, roe deer exhibited a behavioral response race that involved temporally and spatially varying tradeoffs with environmental constraints. We found evidence that nonconsumptive effects of lynx predation risk reduced deer survival and that survival was more sensitive to variation in nonconsumptive effects of lynx than to variation in human proximity. Our findings highlight that nonconsumptive effects may depend on the spatiotemporal distribution of risks and the environmental context, and we discuss how human factors contribute to predator-prey dynamics in human dominated landscapes.","[Gehr, Benedikt; Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hofer, Elizabeth J.; Ryser, Andreas; Vimercati, Eric; Vogt, Kristina] KORA, Carnivore Ecol & Wildlife Management, Thunstr 31, CH-3074 Muri, Switzerland; [Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Zool Museum, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Gehr, B (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",benedikt.Gehr@ieu.uzh.ch,,"Gehr, Benedikt/0000-0002-1044-9296; Lukas, Keller/0000-0002-0149-0174",Federal Office for the Environment [11.0012.PJ/K245-1300]; University of Zurich,This study was funded by the Federal Office for the Environment (grant number: 11.0012.PJ/K245-1300) and the University of Zurich.,,71,11,11,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Here, we analyzed faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of wild roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) living in a human-dominated agro-ecosystem. Using Global Positioning System monitoring of 116 individuals, we assessed their spatial behaviour and tested whether proximity to anthropogenic structures (linear distance to built-up areas) and the use of refuge habitats (woodland and hedges) influenced FCM levels. In accordance with our predictions, individuals ranging closer to anthropogenic structures during daytime had higher FCM levels, but this relationship was buffered as use of refuge habitat increased. In addition, this link between proximity to anthropogenic structures and FCM levels disappeared when we analyzed spatial behaviour at night. Finally, FCM levels were higher when the ambient temperature was lower, and during years of low resource availability. Our results demonstrate that the stress levels of large mammals may be strongly influenced by their proximity to anthropogenic activities, but that these effects may be buffered by behavioural adjustments in terms of space use and circadian rhythm. Whereas most studies have focused on the influence of environmental heterogeneity, our analysis highlights the need to also consider the fine-scale spatial response of individuals when studying the hormonal response of wild animals to human disturbance. We emphasize the potential to mitigate this hormonal stress response, and its potential negative consequences on population dynamics, through the preservation or restoration of patches of refuge habitat in close proximity to human infrastructure.","[Carbillet, Jeffrey; Morellet, Nicolas; Chaval, Yannick; Cargnelutti, Bruno; Hewison, A.

As predicted, great tits that foraged close to the ground moved uphill, whereas blue tits foraging in the tree canopy did not. The Earth is not flat but few have studied antipredator behavior in hilly landscapes. We think the main reason is lack of theory and testable predictions.Few studies have reported flight responses of prey on landscape slopes in the wild, and little theoretical work is available. We present a formal model to predict whether prey should move up or down the hillside after detecting a perched raptor as determined by the duration of the attack once launched by the predator, perching height of the predator, and the landscape slope. We recorded escape responses of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major when approached by a human in the field. This was done in the postfledging period, when the demand for food is high, and when the families usually move to a new site, presumably perceived to be safer, to continue foraging after being exposed to a predator. We found that great tit families, which prefer to forage close to the ground, flew uphill, matching the model's prediction. However, blue tit families, which forage higher in the canopy, did not move uphill but moved higher up in the trees. Vertical movement upward may be the safest option if the predator is located on the ground. Modeling escape flights may encourage detailed studies of attack and escape behaviors in animals and provide insights in predator-prey interactions in general.","[Slagsvold, Tore; Husek, Jan; Whittington, Jason D.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Husek, Jan] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, NO-2480 Koppang, Norway; [Wiebe, Karen L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada",,"Slagsvold, T (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066 Blindern, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway.",tore.slagsvold@ibv.uio.no,"Husek, Jan/AAP-8012-2020; Husek, Jan/R-9513-2019","Husek, Jan/0000-0001-9589-8519; ",,,,34,0,0,1,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

However, even within populations of noise-sensitive species, individuals still select breeding sites located within areas exposed to high noise levels, with largely unknown physiological and fitness consequences. We use a study system in the natural gas fields of northern New Mexico to test the prediction that exposure to noise causes glucocorticoid-signaling dysfunction and decreases fitness in a community of secondary cavity-nesting birds. In accordance with these predictions, and across all species, we find strong support for noise exposure decreasing baseline corticosterone in adults and nestlings and, conversely, increasing acute stressor-induced corticosterone in nestlings. We also document fitness consequences with increased noise in the form of reduced hatching success in the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), the species most likely to nest in noisiest environments. Nestlings of all three species exhibited accelerated growth of both feathers and body size at intermediate noise amplitudes compared with lower or higher amplitudes. Our results are consistent with recent experimental laboratory studies and show that noise functions as a chronic, inescapable stressor. Anthropogenic noise likely impairs environmental risk perception by species relying on acoustic cues and ultimately leads to impacts on fitness. Our work, when taken together with recent efforts to document noise across the landscape, implies potential widespread, noise-induced chronic stress coupled with reduced fitness for many species reliant on acoustic cues.","[Kleist, Nathan J.; Cruz, Alexander] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kleist, Nathan J.] SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol, Brockport, NY 14420 USA; [Guralnick, Robert P.] Univ Florida, Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Integrat Physiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lowry, Christopher A.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Ctr Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Francis, Clinton D.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",,"Kleist, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Kleist, NJ (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Brockport, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol, Brockport, NY 14420 USA.",nathan.kleist@colorado.edu,,"Lowry, Christopher/0000-0003-3920-5575; Kleist, Nathan/0000-0002-2468-4318","National Geographic Research and Exploration GrantNational Geographic Society; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNH 1414171, DEB 1556192]; North American Bluebird Society grant; University of Colorado Graduate School; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive SciNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1414171] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1556192] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank the many field and laboratory assistants who helped make this work possible, especially Clare O'Connor-Seville, Sara Bombaci, Ian Harold, Skye Salganek, Anna Vinton, and Kate Zator; Jesse Barber for constructive comments on earlier drafts; Joseph Ortega and Rebecca Safran for generous use of laboratory space and equipment during assay procedures; Jim Chace for help with bird-banding logistics; and the reviewers and the editor for their comments and feedback throughout the review process.

Little is known about whether such calling is affected by the facial orientation of a potential threat, however. We tested for an effect of facial orientation of a potential threat on tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, a songbird that uses chick-a-dee calls in a variety of social contexts. In two studies, a human observer wore an animal mask that either faced or faced away from the focal bird(s). In Study 1, focal birds were individual titmice captured in a walk-in trap, and the observer stood near the trapped bird. In Study 2, focal birds were titmouse flocks utilizing a feeding station and the observer stood near the station. In both studies, calling behavior was affected by mask orientation. In Study 2, foraging and agonistic behavior were also affected. Titmice can therefore perceive the facial orientation of a potential threat, and this perception affects different behavioral systems, including calling. Our results indicate sensitivity of titmice to the facial orientation of a potential predator in two quite different motivational contexts. This work suggests the possibility of strategic signaling by prey species depending upon the perceptual space of a detected predator.","[Freeberg, Todd M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Psychol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Freeberg, Todd M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Krama, Tatjana; Vrublevska, Jolanta; Krams, Indrikis] Daugavpils Univ, Inst Systemat Biol, Daugavpils, Latvia; [Krams, Indrikis] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia; [Kullberg, Cecilia] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Freeberg, TM (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Psychol, Austin Peay Bldg 301B, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",tfreeber@utk.edu,"Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108; Freeberg, Todd/0000-0003-3807-4147",Fulbright Teaching Award,"We thank the staffs of Ijams Nature Center (Knoxville, TN), Norris Dam State Park (Norris, TN), and the University of Tennessee Forest Resources, Research, and Education Center (Oak Ridge, TN), for allowing us to record tufted titmice on their grounds.

Microplastics are potentially more hazardous than macroplastics, as the former can permeate biological membranes. The toxicity of microplastic exposure on humans and aquatic organisms has been documented, but the toxicity and behavioral changes of nanoplastics (NPs) in mammals are scarce. In spite of their small size, nanoplastics have an enormous surface area, which bears the potential to bind even bigger amounts of toxic compounds in comparison to microplastics. Here, we used polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) (diameter size at similar to 70 nm) to investigate the neurobehavioral alterations, tissue distribution, accumulation, and specific health risk of nanoplastics in adult zebrafish. The results demonstrated that PS-NPs accumulated in gonads, intestine, liver, and brain with a tissue distribution pattern that was greatly dependent on the size and shape of the NPs particle. Importantly, an analysis of multiple behavior endpoints and different biochemical biomarkers evidenced that PS-NPs exposure induced disturbance of lipid and energy metabolism as well as oxidative stress and tissue accumulation. Pronounced behavior alterations in their locomotion activity, aggressiveness, shoal formation, and predator avoidance behavior were exhibited by the high concentration of the PS-NPs group, along with the dysregulated circadian rhythm locomotion activity after its chronic exposure. Moreover, several important neurotransmitter biomarkers for neurotoxicity investigation were significantly altered after one week of PS-NPs exposure and these significant changes may indicate the potential toxicity from PS-NPs exposure. In addition, after similar to 1-month incubation, the fluorescence spectroscopy results revealed the accumulation and distribution of PS-NPs across zebrafish tissues, especially in gonads, which would possibly further affect fish reproductive function. Overall, our results provided new evidence for the adverse consequences of PS-NPs-induced behavioral dysregulation and changes at the molecular level that eventually reduce the survival fitness of zebrafish in the ecosystem.","[Sarasamma, Sreeja; Audira, Gilbert; Hsiao, Chung-Der] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Chem, Chungli 32023, Taiwan; [Sarasamma, Sreeja; Audira, Gilbert; Siregar, Petrus; Liang, Sung-Tzu; Hsiao, Chung-Der] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Biosci Technol, Chungli 32023, Taiwan; [Malhotra, Nemi] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Chungli 32023, Taiwan; [Lai, Yu-Heng] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Chem, Taipei 11114, Taiwan; [Chen, Jung-Ren] I Shou Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan; [Chen, Kelvin H-C] Natl Pingtung Univ, Dept Appl Chem, Pingtung 90003, Taiwan; [Hsiao, Chung-Der] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Ctr Nanotechnol, Chungli 32023, Taiwan",,"Hsiao, CD (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Chem, Chungli 32023, Taiwan.; Hsiao, CD (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Biosci Technol, Chungli 32023, Taiwan.; Chen, JR (corresponding author), I Shou Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Kaohsiung 82445, Taiwan.; Chen, KHC (corresponding author), Natl Pingtung Univ, Dept Appl Chem, Pingtung 90003, Taiwan.; Hsiao, CD (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Ctr Nanotechnol, Chungli 32023, Taiwan.",sreejakarthik@hotmail.com; gilbertaudira@yahoo.com; siregar.petrus27@gmail.com; nemi.malhotra@gmail.com; lyh21@ulive.pccu.edu.tw; stliang3@gmail.com; jrchen@isu.edu.tw; kelvin@mail.nptu.edu.tw; cdhsiao@cycu.edu.tw,"Hsiao, Chung-Der/W-4535-2019; Sarasamma, Sreeja/AEM-6749-2022","Hsiao, Chung-Der/0000-0002-6398-8672; Sarasamma, Sreeja/0000-0002-8576-0097; Liang, Sung-Tzu/0000-0002-4068-4430; Malhotra, Nemi/0000-0002-5920-0803","Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 105-2313-B-033-001-MY3, MOST 107-2622-B-033-001-CC2, MOST 106-2113-M-153-002, MOST 108-2113-M-153-003]","This study was funded by the grants sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology, MOST 105-2313-B-033-001-MY3 and MOST 107-2622-B-033-001-CC2 to C.-D.H. and MOST 106-2113-M-153-002 and MOST 108-2113-M-153-003 to K.H.-C.C.",,117,58,60,32,94,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1422-0067,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

We simulated predator attacks on blackbirds Turdus merula to investigate the factors influencing blackbirds to select between these strategies. The probability that blackbirds would fly increased as flight initiation distance decreased, suggesting that they may trade-off benefits of delaying escape with a costly escape strategy. The probability of flying also increased as the number of potential predators increased, indicating an increase in perceived predation risk with the number of non-attacking predators. Running was more likely to be used in the mornings and flying in the afternoons, suggesting a possible mass-dependent predation risk effect or restrictions in the use of costly escape strategies when energetic reserves are lower. Juvenile blackbirds tended to fly away more often than adults, probably to compensate for their less reliable risk assessments due to lack of experience. We conclude that different factors act independently on choosing an optimal escape strategy, and that the decision about when to escape (flight initiation distance) is associated with the decision about how to escape (escape strategy), which in turn can affect the decision about how far to escape (distance fled).","[Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Rodriguez-Prieto, Inaki; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain",,"Fernandez-Juricic, E (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, MS 3702,1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",efernand@csulb.edu,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998",,,,50,17,18,0,40,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,AUG,2008,145,,8,,,,1125,1138,,10.1163/156853908784474489,,,14,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,318SA,WOS:000257111300007,,Green Submitted,,,2022-04-19,

When a prey detects an approaching predator, it suddenly interrupts its ongoing activity and behaves according to the predator's distance. A prey enters TI when the fight or flight reaction is not feasible and the animal is captured. TI is defined as a post-contact, all or none, innate immobility reflex response that persists after the end of the prey-predator contact. In humans, vasovagal syncope, a reversible adaptive response frequently associated with fainting, occurs in response to emergency conditions such as strong emotions, orthostatic stress, anoxia, visceral pain and decrease in blood volume. The aim of the present review is to dispute the hypothesis that human vasovagal syncope represents the evolution of the bradycardia observed during freezing in a prey-predator condition in other vertebrates. The hypothesis does not take into account three crucial issues: 1) freezing and TI are defence responses which differ from each other in behavioural, cardiovascular and neurophysiological correlates; 2) the initial phase of vasovagal syncope is associated with tachycardia, whereas freezing is associated with a sudden fast-developing bradycardia; 3) the second phase of vasovagal syncope terminates with a blood pressure collapse, whereas blood pressure levels remain at basal levels during both freezing and TI.","[Carli, Giancarlo; Farabollini, Francesca] Univ Siena, Dept Med Surg & Neurosci, Siena, Italy",,"Carli, G (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Med Surg & Neurosci, Siena, Italy.",giancarlo.carli@unisi.it,,,,,,71,0,0,2,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0031-9384,1873-507X,,PHYSIOL BEHAV,Physiol.

Despite increasing evidence that the additional noise generated by human activities can affect vocal communication, the majority of research has focused on the use of conspecific acoustic information, especially sexual signals. Many animals are known to eavesdrop on the alarm calls produced by other species, enhancing their likelihood of avoiding predation, but how this use of heterospecific information is affected by anthropogenic noise has received little empirical attention. Here, we use two field-based playback experiments on a habituated wild population of dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to determine how anthropogenic noise influences the response of foragers to heterospecific alarm calls. We begin by demonstrating that dwarf mongooses respond appropriately to the alarm calls of sympatric chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) and tree squirrels (Paraxerus cepapi); fleeing only to the latter. We then show that mongoose foragers are less likely to exhibit this flee response to tree squirrel alarm calls during road-noise playback compared to ambient-sound playback. One explanation for the change in response is that noise-induced distraction or stress result in maladaptive behaviour. However, further analysis revealed that road-noise playback results in increased vigilance and that mongooses showing the greatest vigilance increase are those that do not subsequently exhibit a flee response to the alarm call. These individuals may therefore be acting appropriately: if the greater gathering of personal information indicates the absence of an actual predator despite an alarm call, the need to undertake costly fleeing behaviour can be avoided.

Field studies of each species in relatively undisturbed habitats provided data including behavioral interactions between avian predators and squirrel monkeys and the latter's vigilance response, habitat use, group size, population density and within-group food competition. Three hypotheses were examined. The first two identified aspects of the habitat structure exploited by squirrel monkeys and their avian predators as key parameters. (1) The overall success of avian attacks is a function of the density of understory vegetation present to hinder these birds from closely approaching individual troop members. (2) The extent of continuous canopy forest cover within habitats underlies which of two vigilance strategies are exhibited. Preemptive vigilance occurs when monkeys allocate time to visual scrutiny in a manner consistent with the intent of obtaining advance warning on the approach of an avian predator. During reactive vigilance, in contrast, monkeys are not overtly vigilant against an aerial attack until an attack or other stimulus strongly indicative of immediate risk occurs. Preemptive vigilance occurs in open habitats with little canopy, while reactive vigilance predominates when birds can make effective ambush attacks from forest canopy cover. Both hypotheses were supported. Group sizes vary significantly across the three squirrel monkey species with S. boliviensis having the largest and S. sciureus the smallest mean group size. Our third hypothesis examined the premise that group size in social animals reflects a tradeoff between predation risk (whether based on long-term observations or extrapolated from habitat structure) and within-group food competition. The power of this tradeoff mechanism to explain group-size variation was contrasted with a simpler, one parameter model, within-group food competition under an ideal free distribution. The ideal free distribution approach was consistent with the observed ranking of group sizes, whereas the tradeoff model provided mixed results. In retrospect, the weakness of the tradeoff model is not surprising. Changes in the risk incurred by individual members of a squirrel monkey troop as a consequence of variation in group size are likely of much smaller magnitude than the risk exposure resulting from local habitat structure.","Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Florida, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Washington Univ, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",,"Boinski, S (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Anthropol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",boinski@ufl.edu,,,,,,180,64,65,2,54,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,NOV-DEC,2003,140,,11-12,,,,1421,1467,,10.1163/156853903771980666,,,47,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,766EU,WOS:000188354400005,,,,,2022-04-19,

Yet, given that the brain reorganises during reading acquisition, it is unknown when and how these reading routes emerge and whether neural deficits in dyslexia predate reading onset. Using diffusion MRI in 36 pre-readers with a family risk for dyslexia (FRD+) and 35 well matched pre-readers without a family risk (FRD-), our results show that phonological predictors of reading are sustained bilaterally by both ventral and dorsal tracts. This suggests that a dorsal and left-hemispheric specialisation for phonological aspects of reading, as observed in adults, is presumably gradually formed throughout reading development. Second, our results indicate that FRD+ pre-readers display mainly white matter differences in left ventral tracts. This suggests that atypical white matter organisation previously found in dyslexic adults may be causal rather than resulting from a lifetime of reading difficulties, and that the location of such a deficit may vary throughout development. While this study forms an important starting point, longitudinal follow-up of these children will allow further investigation of the dynamics between emerging literacy development and white matter connections.

Despite significant research into crop-foraging by primates, relatively little is understood about the behavior and movements of primates in and around crop fields, largely due to the limitations of traditional observational methods. Crop-foraging by primates in large-scale agriculture has also received little attention. We used GPS and accelerometer bio-loggers, along with environmental data, to gain an understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of activity for a female in a crop-foraging baboon group in and around commercial farms in South Africa over one year. Crop fields were avoided for most of the year, suggesting that fields are perceived as a high-risk habitat. When field visits did occur, this was generally when plant primary productivity was low, suggesting that crops were a fallback food. All recorded field visits were at or before 15:00. Activity was significantly higher in crop fields than in the landscape in general, evidence that crop-foraging is an energetically costly strategy and that fields are perceived as a risky habitat. In contrast, activity was significantly lower within 100 m of the field edge than in the rest of the landscape, suggesting that baboons wait near the field edge to assess risks before crop-foraging. Together, this understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop-foraging can help to inform crop protection strategies and reduce conflict between humans and baboons in South Africa.","[Walton, Ben J.; Findlay, Leah J.; Hill, Russell A.] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Hill, Russell A.] Lajuma Res Ctr, Primate & Predator Project, Louis Trichardt, Makhado, South Africa; [Hill, Russell A.] Univ Venda, Dept Zool, Thohoyandou, South Africa",,"Walton, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",benjamin.j.walton@durham.ac.uk,"Hill, Russell/D-9113-2013; Walton, Ben/AAS-4337-2020","Hill, Russell/0000-0002-7601-5802; Walton, Ben/0000-0002-0590-1305","Earthwatch Institute; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J500215/1, NE/S007431/1]","Earthwatch Institute; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/J500215/1 and NE/S007431/1",,59,1,1,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The issue studied was whether horses transformed by humans and placed in stable-pasture environments had retained their natural abilities to respond to predation risk. The objective of the study was to determine the changes in cardiac activity, cortisol concentrations, and behavior of horses in response to the vocalizations of two predators: the gray wolf (Canis lupus), which the horses of the breed studied had coevolved with but not been exposed to recently, and Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr), from which the horses had been mostly isolated. In addition, we hypothesized that a higher proportion of Thoroughbred (TB) horse ancestry in the pedigree would result in higher emotional excitability in response to predator vocalizations. Nineteen horses were divided into groups of 75%, 50% and 25% TB ancestry. The auditory test conducted in a paddock comprised a 10-min prestimulus period, a 5-min stimulus period when one of the predators was heard, and a 10-min poststimulus period without any experimental stimuli.ResultsThe increase in heart rate and saliva cortisol concentration in response to predator vocalizations indicated some level of stress in the horses. The lowered beat-to-beat intervals revealed a decrease in parasympathetic nervous system activity. The behavioral responses were less distinct than the physiological changes. The responses were more pronounced with leopard vocalizations than wolf vocalizations.ConclusionsThe horses responded with weak signs of anxiety when exposed to predator vocalizations. A tendency towards a stronger internal reaction to predators in horses with a higher proportion of TB genes suggested that the response intensity was partly innate. The more pronounced response to leopard than wolf may indicate that horses are more frightened of a threatening sound from an unknown predator than one known by their ancestors. The differing response can be also due to differences in the characteristic of the predators' vocalizations. Our findings suggested that the present-day horses' abilities to coexist with predators are weak. Hence, humans should protect horses against predation, especially when introducing them into seminatural locations.","[Janczarek, Iwona; Stachurska, Anna; Wisniewska, Anna; Koziol, Agata] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Horse Breeding & Use, Akad 13 Str, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland; [Kedzierski, Witold] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Biochem, Lublin, Poland; [Ryzak, Magdalena] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agrophys, Lublin, Poland",,"Stachurska, A (corresponding author), Univ Life Sci Lublin, Dept Horse Breeding & Use, Akad 13 Str, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland.",anna.stachurska@up.lublin.pl,,"Wisniewska, Anna/0000-0003-1127-2960; Ryzak, Magdalena/0000-0002-6400-5375; Stachurska, Anna/0000-0003-4616-5583; Janczarek, Iwona/0000-0001-9032-8840; Kedzierski, Witold/0000-0001-7532-805X","University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Poland","This work was funded by University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Poland, which is the employer of the authors.

We explored this phenomenon in dugongs (Dugong dugon) subject to spatially and temporally variable risk of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation in Shark Bay, Australia. Dugong behaviour was assayed using focal follows and organised into sequences of foraging, resting, and travelling bouts. We used log-linear analysis to test for sequence differences in relation to habitat (deep, shallow) and predation danger (sharks present, largely absent). Dugongs modified their behavioural sequences between periods of high and low shark abundance: those at risk alternated more frequently between foraging, which constrains anti-predator vigilance, and travelling, which facilitates predator detection. Dugongs also avoided continuous series of resting bouts, during which awareness is reduced, when sharks were present. These changes were only observed in relatively dangerous shallow habitat, which is hunted disproportionately by tiger sharks; behavioural responses to sharks in deep habitat were modest. We conclude that dugongs in risky habitat resort to safer behavioural sequences in response to sharks. Given that human disturbance and predators are perceived similarly by many species, some forms of vessel interaction could compromise the fitness of sirenians by eliciting similar behavioural adjustment.","[Wirsing, Aaron J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, N Miami, FL 33181 USA",,"Wirsing, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",wirsinga@u.washington.edu,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0526065, OCE0745606]; National Geographic Society Expeditions CouncilNational Geographic Society; NSERC CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [A6869]; PADI Foundation","We thank J.

Our goal was to determine whether non-lethal effects of a common predator, coyotes (Canis latrans), could affect the behavior of a declining reptile, the Mojave Desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), hereafter tortoise. We exposed captive tortoises to olfactory and visual cues of coyotes and measured their resulting foraging behavior, burrow use, and other antipredator behaviors. We also measured risk of coyote predation in wild tortoises based on burrow use. Willingness to feed and time spent feeding were unaffected by the presence of coyote urine, but higher air temperatures at the start of feeding caused a decrease in time spent at their food dish. Captive tortoises chronically exposed to coyote urine did, however, spend more time in their burrows than when exposed to rabbit urine. When exposed to a coyote decoy, captive tortoises showed more general antipredator behaviors than those exposed to a control stimulus (deer decoy). Wild tortoises were less likely to be depredated by coyotes, if they were encountered in burrows more frequently. Predator olfactory and visual cues exerted non-lethal effects on captive tortoises through behavioral adjustments to their refuge-seeking behavior, which was a behavior linked to decreased coyote predation risk for wild tortoises. Human-subsidized predator populations may negatively affect declining species, including reptiles, as a result of behavioral modifications in response to predator cues. Significance statement Predators can affect behavior of animals through olfactory and visual cues, which can have measurable effects on prey populations. Changes in prey behavior in response to predator presence can occur at the expense of opportunities to forage or reproduce, leading to decreased survival and reproduction. We tested behavioral responses of captive Mojave Desert tortoises to olfactory and visual cues of coyotes, which are a common predator in the Mojave Desert and subsidized by human food sources. Foraging behavior of captive tortoises was strongly affected by air temperatures at the start of feeding, but not coyote cues. Captive tortoises did, however, increase the amount of time they spent in burrows when coyote urine was present and showed greater fearfulness at the presentation of coyote urine combined with coyote models. Increased burrow use was associated with lower risk of coyote predation in wild tortoises, which suggested an advantage to increased refuge use when coyotes were detectable. Responses by tortoises suggest that coyote cues on the landscape affect tortoises through behavioral pathways that result in increased refuge use.","[Nafus, Melia G.; Germano, Jennifer M.; Swaisgood, Ronald R.] San Diego Zool Global, Inst Conservat Res, Appl Anim Ecol, San Diego, CA 92101 USA; [Nafus, Melia G.] US Geol Survey, Invas Species Sci Branch, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Nafus, Melia G.] Ft Collins Sci Ctr, 2150 Ctr Ave C, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Germano, Jennifer M.] New Zealand Dept Conservat, Private Bag 5, Nelson, New Zealand",,"Nafus, MG (corresponding author), San Diego Zool Global, Inst Conservat Res, Appl Anim Ecol, San Diego, CA 92101 USA.; Nafus, MG (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Invas Species Sci Branch, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.; Nafus, MG (corresponding author), Ft Collins Sci Ctr, 2150 Ctr Ave C, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",mnafus@usgs.gov,"Swaisgood, Ronald R/AAL-3198-2020","Swaisgood, Ronald R/0000-0001-5353-2148",US Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service [F09AC00452]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1148897],"Funding for this research was provided by US Fish and Wildlife Service (Agreement #F09AC00452).

All experiments were performed with a human approaching incubating Eurasian curlews Numenius arquata, a ground-nesting wader species under high egg predation pressure. Our results show that hatching success was higher in nests where the incubating parent left at intermediate FIDs compared to short and long ones, and that FID decreased with date and time of the evening. Further, FIDs from repeated approaches were not consistent within nests.

While numerous aspects of vigilance have been extensively studied, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the role of vigilance in escaping from predators. In a multispecies approach, we measured vigilance (as the proportion of time spent in a head-up posture) and three consecutive components of escape behaviour, predetection distance, assessment interval and flight initiation distance, of wild birds in urban and rural habitats in three European countries. Escape behaviour was induced by a human observer walking towards the focal bird whose vigilance was measured beforehand. More vigilant individuals did not detect predators earlier than less vigilant ones. In addition, more vigilant individuals spent more time on risk assessment and escaped later. Body mass was positively correlated with vigilance for birds on higher perches, where we expected vigilance to be less important. Finally, urban birds were more vigilant than rural birds, suggesting that distractions in urban habitats might have a more profound impact on vigilance than the expected lower predation risk. These results challenge the underlying assumption that more vigilant individuals have a higher perceived risk of predation and hence better odds at avoiding predation. We explain our results in the context that higher levels of vigilance compensate for environmental distractions and for innate deficiencies or lack of experience that constrain the detection of predators. We suggest that a re-examination of the basic functions and markers of vigilance is needed before using it as a measure of fearfulness in birds.

We exposed nine adult free-ranging female moose repeatedly to off-trail backcountry skiing to study moose behavior and habituation using a controlled field experiment in Northern Sweden. Moose response was short-term, but distinct. Moose moved 33-fold faster during the first hour following disturbance, resulting in almost a doubling of the energetic usage per kilogram body weight. Movement rates increased 3 h following disturbances, came along with enlarged activity ranges at the day of disturbance, and resulted in moose leaving the original area. We found no evidence for habituation. Because of the short-term response, the effect of single skiing disturbance events on the overall energy budget of large-bodied animals in good body condition is likely to be negligible. We recommend off-trail skiers to avoid following wildlife tracks because such disturbances bear risk for more severe consequences on wildlife's energy budget if wildlife resists habituation, if an animal's risk perception is high, or when the frequency of disturbance increases.","[Neumann, Wiebke; Ericsson, Goran; Dettki, Holger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden",,"Neumann, W (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",Wiebke.Neumann@vfm.slu.se; Goran.Ericsson@vfm.slu.se; Holger.Dettki@vfm.slu.se,,"Neumann, Wiebke/0000-0002-0000-4816",EU/Interregional IIIA project Moose in MidscandinaviaEuropean Commission; Moose Management in Vasterbotten; Adaptive Management of Fish and Wildlife; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,"We thank the EU/Interregional IIIA project Moose in Midscandinavia, the project Moose Management in Vasterbotten, the program Adaptive Management of Fish and Wildlife, the Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency for the financial support.

While the effects of human interference on primate behavior and ecology are an important area of research in contemporary primatology, to date there is no systematic way to report the types or level of anthropogenic influence for a primate study population. In this paper, I introduce a diagnostic classification system that will allow primate field researchers to clearly and consistently report anthropogenic conditions at their study sites. This system provides a way to identify population conditions for four major variables: landscape, human-nonhuman primate interface, diet, and predation risk. The incredible diversity of the Order Primates necessitates a descriptive system that is applicable across a wide range of habitat types, social groupings, and ecological roles, so the proposed classification system has been specifically designed to avoid quantitative ranking. Instead, the system is intended to provide a standardized way to report a wealth of population and site information in a simple format. This will allow for meta-analysis of specific conditions across study sites, leading to a greater understanding of the effects of different forms of anthropogenic influence on primate behavior and ecology.

Patterns of neighbour proximity and neighbour density were examined among adults in four groups under different ecological and social conditions (through instantaneous sampling during focal follows). Initial analysis of these data shows that (1) the use of vertical substrates (refuges such as tall trees and cliff faces) can confound patterns of spacing, and (2) individual differences in spacing can depend on the spatial scale over which it is measured. To minimise these substrate and scale effects, this analysis focuses on animals which are off refuges and examines spacing behaviour through its underlying statistical 'dimensions' (identified through factor analysis). Analysis of these dimensions indicates that sex, group size, activity-habitat and female reproductive state can all have independent effects on spacing: (1) males are more dispersed than females in smaller groups, (2) male and female dispersion increases with time spent in foraging habitats, and (3) female dispersion is reduced during lactation. According to the hypotheses tested, these results indicate that feeding competition only affects spacing behaviour during foraging while predation risk plays little or no role in spacing. Most aspects of spacing behaviour are best explained by male reproductive strategies and their social repercussions.","Univ London Univ Coll, Dept Anthropol, London WC1E 6BT, England",,"Cowlishaw, G (corresponding author), Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England.",g.cowlishaw@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,63,39,41,0,38,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

These pavements are conspicuous to human observers, suggesting that they may also attract predators. The size of the pavement was correlated with, but not limited by, the density of dung in the vicinity of the nest. The relationship between pavement size and local dung density did not differ significantly between habitats or years, suggesting that females might scale their pavements according to the perceived trampling risk. Even in heavily grazed areas nest trampling was rare, and nest survival rates were similar to those in areas with few grazing animals, suggesting that pavements may reduce trampling risk without incurring an additional predation risk or, alternatively, that trampling is currently not an important threat to lark nests. An experimental manipulation of grazing animals around artificial nests yielded equivocal support for a trampling-deterrent effect of dung pavements. Dung pavements might also provide thermal benefits; experiments on artificial nests suggested that dung pavements buffer nests against extremes of heat and cold, and there was equivocal support for a positive effect of pavement size on chick tarsus growth rates. These pavements may therefore be multifunctional, but identifying the adaptive drivers of the behavior requires further research.","[Fijen, Thijs P.

Many of these structures display abnormal activity levels in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, some of them, like the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and amygdala, are comprised of several small sub-regions or nuclei that cannot be resolved with human neuroimaging techniques. Therefore, we used a well-characterized rat model of PTSD to compare neuronal properties in resilient vs PTSD-like rats using patch recordings obtained from different BNST and amygdala regions in vitro. In this model, a persistent state of extreme anxiety is induced in a subset of susceptible rats following predatory threat. Previous animal studies have revealed that the central amygdala (CeA) and BNST are differentially involved in the genesis of fear and anxiety-like states, respectively. Consistent with these earlier findings, we found that between resilient and PTSD-like rats were marked differences in the synaptic responsiveness of neurons in different sectors of BNST and CeA, but whose polarity was region specific. In light of prior data about the role of these regions, our results suggest that control of fear/anxiety expression is altered in PTSD-like rats such that the influence of CeA is minimized whereas that of BNST is enhanced. A model of the amygdalo-BNST interactions supporting the PTSD-like state is proposed.","[Rodriguez-Sierra, O. E.; Turesson, H.

Animals in poor condition may accept greater predation risk to satisfy current foraging 'needs', while those in good condition may be more risk averse to protect future 'assets'. These state-dependent behavioural predictions can help interpret responses to human activities, but are little explored in marine animals. This study investigates the influence of body condition on how beaked whales trade-off foraging and predator avoidance. Body density (indicating lipid-energy stores) was estimated for 15 foraging northern bottlenose whales tagged near Jan Mayen, Norway. Composite indices of foraging (diving and echolocation clicks) and anti-predation (long ascents, non-foraging dives and silent periods reducing predator eavesdropping) were negatively related. Experimental sonar exposures led to decreased foraging and increased risk aversion, confirming a foraging/perceived safety trade-off. However, lower lipid stores were not related to a decrease in predator avoidance versus foraging, i.e. worse condition animals did not prioritize foraging. Individual differences (personalities) or reproductive context could offer alternative explanations for the observed state-behaviour relationships. This study provides evidence of foraging/predator-avoidance trade-offs in a marine top predator and demonstrates that animals in worse condition might not always take more risks.","[Siegal, Eilidh; Hooker, Sascha K.; Isojunno, Saana; Miller, Patrick J.

Studying the impacts of human activities on wildlife from a behavioral perspective is a relevant starting point to understand the mechanisms underlying population and species resistance and resilience to disturbances. In this study, we assessed the effects of weather (temperature and precipitation), habitat disturbances (roads and clearcuts), and natural habitat types on the space use patterns of a threatened boreal population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). An extensive data set of 288,665 relocations from 50 adult females outfitted with GPS collars over 7 years in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada was used to evaluate residency time in natural and disturbed habitats for five distinct biologically defined periods. The most parsimonious linear mixed-effects model for each period showed that individuals stayed longer in more natural habitat types. During calving and summer, residency time decreased with increasing road density, whereas residency time decreased with increasing temperature during winter and spring. We found no evidence of a synergistic effect between daily weather and human disturbances on movement behavior of caribou, but consider their respective influence as additive. We also showed large individual variation in residency time, except during the calving period. Lower individual variation in residency time during calving may be explained by strong evolutionary constraints on behavior faced by females to ensure protection and survival of their offspring. Based on our results, we suggest keeping large patches of suitable and roadless habitat for caribou to favor the spacing-out antipredator strategy exhibited by females during calving. By tracking individuals over several complete annual cycles, we showed variation in the effects of daily weather and human disturbances on residency time across biological periods. Our study highlights that the inclusion of daily weather variables helps better understand space-use patterns of a threatened species.","[Leclerc, Martin] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Appl Conservat Sci Lab, STN CSC, POB 1700, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Leclerc, Martin] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, POB 2429, Sidney, BC V8L 3Y3, Canada; [Leclerc, Martin; St-Laurent, Martin-Hugues] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Northern Studies, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Leclerc, Martin; St-Laurent, Martin-Hugues] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Forest Res, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Tarroux, Arnaud; Fauchald, Per; Stien, Audun; Tveraa, Torkild] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Arctic Ecol Dept, Fram Ctr, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway",,"St-Laurent, MH (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Northern Studies, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.; St-Laurent, MH (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Forest Res, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",martin-hugues_st-laurent@uqar.ca,"Tarroux, Arnaud/AAE-5173-2021; Leclerc, Martin/AAR-4742-2020; Fauchald, Per/AAV-4242-2021","Tarroux, Arnaud/0000-0001-8306-6694; Leclerc, Martin/0000-0002-4429-697X; ","Raincoast Conservation Foundation; FRQNT [255026]; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies; Fonds de recherche forestiere du Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Ministere des Forets, de la Faune et des Parcs du Quebec; Conseil de l'Industrie Forestiere du Quebec; Federation Canadienne de la Faune; Fondation de la Faune du Quebec; World Wildlife Fund for Nature; Resolute Forest Products Inc.; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski","We thank B.

Presently, conservation research and actions focus predominantly on fragmentation caused directly by physical transformation of the landscape (e.g. deforestation, agriculture, urbanization, roads, etc.). While there is no doubt that landscape features play a key role in fragmenting populations or enhancing connectivity, fragmentation may also come about by processes other than the transformation of the landscape and which may not be readily visible. Such landscape-independent fragmentation (LIF) usually comes about when anthropogenic disturbance alters the inter- and intra-specific interactions among and within species. LIF and its drivers have received little attention in the scientific literature and in the management of wildlife populations. We discuss three major classes of LIF processes and their relevance for the conservation and management of species and habitats: (i) interspecific dispersal dependency, in which populations of species that rely on other species for transport and propagation become fragmented as the transporting species declines; (ii) interspecific avoidance induction, where species are excluded from habitats and corridors owing to interspecific interactions resulting from anthropogenically induced changes in community structure (e.g. exclusions by increased predation pressure); and (iii) intraspecific behavioural divergence, where populations become segregated owing to anthropogenically induced behavioural differentiation among them.

These aspects of escape behavior are consistent for individuals but also among sites, seasons, and years. Escape behavior expressed in response to a broad range of cuckoo hosts and prey are consistently used against capture by humans, but also hosts and brood parasites and predators and their prey. An interspecific comparative phylogenetic analysis of escape behavior by hosts and their brood parasites and prey and their predators revealed evidence of consistent behavior when encountering potential parasites or predators. We hypothesize that personality axes such as those ranging from fearfulness to being bold, and from neophobic to curiosity response in brood parasites constitute important components of defense against brood parasitism that reduces the overall risk of parasitism.","[Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Saclay, CNRS UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Batiment 362, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Moller, Anders Pape] Beijing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Si, Xingfeng] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Zhejiang Tiantong Forest Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",,"Moller, AP (corresponding author), Univ Saclay, CNRS UMR 8079, Lab Ecol Systemat & Evolut, Batiment 362, F-91405 Orsay, France.; Moller, AP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",anders.moller@u-psud.fr,,,,,,65,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1674-5507,2396-9814,,CURR ZOOL,Curr.

The mechanisms by which native ungulates cope with the combined effects of competition, predation and human disturbance are poorly understood. Addressing this knowledge gap will help guide management and conservation plans for large mammal communities outside of strictly protected areas. We conducted animal counts on line transects and used a spatially explicit distance sampling model to test the influence of bottom-up effects (vegetation), top-down effects from African lion Panthera leo and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta and human disturbance (livestock density, occupied human settlements) on native ungulate densities and distributions across a multiple-use rangeland in Kenya. We examined five species that varied in body morphology and foraging strategy, including two large-bodied grazers (zebra Equus quagga; wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus), two medium-bodied, mixed-feeders (Grant's gazelle Nanger granti; impala Aepyceros melampus) and one very large-bodied browser (giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi). Densities and distributions of all species varied across available land-use types, with bottom-up effects (vegetation) and human disturbance having the strongest overall effects. Responses varied by ungulate foraging strategy. Distributions of grazers and the browser (giraffe) changed seasonally, while distributions of mixed-feeders and a grazer (zebra) changed diurnally. At broad spatial scales, ungulates did not respond to long-term variation in predation risk though they have been shown to respond behaviourally to short-term variation in risk.Synthesis and applications. Our results revealed that native ungulates in this multiple-use rangeland occur at densities comparable to many flagship protected area populations. We attribute observed densities to spatial heterogeneity across this landscape that included variation in human land use (community conservation area, seasonal settlements and livestock grazing, permanent settlements) and vegetation (grassland, bushland, woodland) that changed through time (seasonally, diurnally). This variation allowed ungulates to carve out ecological niches while reducing exposure to the potential limiting effects of competition and human disturbance. For some species, securing access to forage resources and avoiding human disturbance may be associated with costs through increased risk of predation. Our research reveals the trade-offs native ungulates make to cope with changes in forage availability, human disturbance and predation risk, providing important insights to help guide native ungulate conservation efforts in multiple-use rangelands.","[Schuette, Paul; Creel, Scott] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, 310 Lewis Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Schuette, Paul] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Christianson, Dave] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Biol Sci East 325, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Schuette, P (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, 310 Lewis Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.; Schuette, P (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",pschuett@esf.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-0642393, IOS-1145749]; Cincinnati Zoo; Panthera Kaplan Graduate fellowship","We thank the Kenya Ministry of Science and Technology (Permit: NCST/RRI/12/1/MAS/03/7) and the Kenya Wildlife Service (Permit: KWS/CRA/5001) for permission to conduct this research.

If this species is to continue expanding its range northward, it will move onto the Canadian Shield, where calcium (Ca) availability is low and is predicted to decline further in the future. Dissolved Ca is a vital functional component of mollusc and crustacean physiology, important for exoskeletal condition and strength, as well as metabolic activity. However, some organisms are able to compensate for reduced structural integrity by modifying their behaviour. In this study, we asked if the invasive O. rusticus can survive low levels of ambient Ca and, if it can, whether it exhibits modified antipredator behavior in response to the physiological limitations imposed by low [Ca]. We found that, under reduced Ca levels, O. rusticus reduced the frequency of standard activities (such as grooming and foraging) and was more likely to engage in vigilance and (or) escape behavior. We also found that some individuals, in extremely low [Ca], died while molting. This study suggests that Ca limitation on the Shield, especially where predators are present, may limit the northward expansion of O. rusticus beyond their current range limit.","[Edwards, Brie A.; Rodd, F.

Construction of nest defensive structures can reduce the probability of predation but will involve various costs. Here, we examined both the costs and benefits of the construction of a nest defensive structure in a paper wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, and clarify whether the paper wasp changes the level of defensive structures of nests depending on predation risk. A foundress (queen) of the paper wasp starts a colony in spring and maintains her nest alone until the emergence of workers. At this stage, pupae in the nests are sometimes preyed on by conspecifics of other nests. The intruder needs to break the cocoon, which seals the entrance of the cell, to extract the pupa from the cell. Foundresses often apply nest material (pulp) to the surface of cocoons in their nests. We found that pulp on a cocoon increased the time an intruder required to break the cocoon. This result shows that the pulp structure on cocoons helps to prevent predation on pupae. On the other hand, pulp on cocoons involved costs, including time required to collect pulp and being a potential obstacle to the emergence of workers from the cocoon. Additionally, we found that the amount of pulp on cocoons was greater in nests under higher predation risk than nests under lower predation risk. These results suggest that pulp on cocoons is a nest defensive structure, and foundresses adjusted the construction of the defensive structure depending on predation risk.","[Furuichi, Sho; Kasuya, Eiiti] Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Sci,Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 812, Japan",,"Furuichi, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Sci,Higashi Ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 812, Japan.",sfuru@kyudai.jp,"Kasuya, Eiiti/B-6447-2013","Furuichi, Sho/0000-0002-6262-4076; Kasuya, Eiiti/0000-0003-3651-5391","Global COE Program Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan; Center of excellence for Asian conservation ecology as a basis of human-nature mutualism; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25650149, 22370010]; Ministry of the Environment, Tokyo, Japan [S9]","We thank all members of our laboratory for their helpful discussions.

Although studies have focused on harvest-driven reductions in abundances and sizes of targeted species, human harvest also alters species morphologies, life histories, and behaviors by selection, plasticity, and shifts in species interactions. Restricting harvest can recover the biomass of targeted species, but it is less clear how behavioral phenotypes recover, particularly relative to the impacts of potentially opposing pathways of human influence. We investigated the effects of protection on the behavioral traits of a marine fish assemblage, recording behavior of 1377 individual fishes of nine targeted kelp forest species across 16 California marine protected areas (MPAs) varying in age, protection level, and diver visitation. With long-term, full protection from harvest, all fish species exhibited shorter flight initiation distance (FID, or the distance at which an animal flees from an approaching threat) and longer time delays before fleeing, despite differences in trophic position, microhabitat use, and other ecological characteristics. These escape behaviors were amplified across new MPAs regardless of protection level, suggesting that recovery is slow and likely the result of differences in genetic or early-life experience among individuals in these long-lived species. Although the effects of full protection from harvest were partially offset by recovering populations of large piscivorous predators, the net effect of long-term, full protection on fish behavior was shorter FID. Additionally, all species had shorter FID at sites more frequently visited by divers, and this effect was greater in sites with long-term, full protection from fishing. To the extent that escape behavior is correlated with foraging behavior and predation rates, these results suggest that human-induced behavioral changes may affect ecosystem processes, even after abundances have recovered. If recovery of ecosystem functioning and services are the management goal, assessments should be broadened to include the recovery of functional traits (including behavior).","[Rhoades, O.

These reductions are remarkably consistent and have been observed in a diverse array of taxa including fish, birds, and mammals. Experiments conducted in common environments indicate that these behavioral differences have a genetic basis. In this study, we quantified differences in fear-related behavior between wild and domesticated zebrafish strains and used microarray analysis to identify genes that may be associated with this variation. Results: Compared to wild zebrafish, domesticated zebrafish spent more time near the water surface and were more likely to occupy the front of the aquarium nearest a human observer. Microarray analysis of the brain transcriptome identified high levels of population variation in gene expression, with 1,749 genes significantly differentially expressed among populations. Genes that varied among populations belonged to functional categories that included DNA repair, DNA photolyase activity, response to light stimulus, neuron development and axon guidance, cell death, iron-binding, chromatin reorganization, and homeobox genes. Comparatively fewer genes (112) differed between domesticated and wild strains with notable genes including gpr177 (wntless), selenoprotein P1a, synaptophysin and synaptoporin, and acyl-CoA binding domain containing proteins (acbd3 and acbd4). Conclusions: Microarray analysis identified a large number of genes that differed among zebrafish populations and may underlie behavioral domestication. Comparisons with similar microarray studies of domestication in rainbow trout and canids identified sixteen evolutionarily or functionally related genes that may represent components of shared molecular mechanisms underlying convergent behavioral evolution during vertebrate domestication.

It has been proposed to model alcohol-induced changes in human brain function and behavior. Here, adult zebrafish populations, AB and SF (short-fin wild type), were exposed to chronic treatment (several days in 0.00% or 0.50% alcohol v/v) and a subsequent acute treatment (1 h in 0.00%, 0.25%, 0.50% or 1.00% alcohol). Behavioral responses of zebrafish to computer-animated images, including a zebrafish shoal and a predator, were quantified using videotracking. Neurochemical changes in the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems in the brain of the fish were measured using high-precision liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The results showed genetic differences in numerous aspects of alcohol-induced changes, including, for the first time, the behavioral effects of withdrawal from alcohol and neurochemical responses to alcohol. For example, withdrawal from alcohol abolished shoaling and increased dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in AB but not in SF fish. The findings show that, first, acute and chronic alcohol induced changes are quantifiable with automated behavioral paradigms; second, robust neurochemical changes are also detectable; and third, genetic factors influence both alcohol-induced behavioral and neurotransmitter level changes. Although the causal relationship underlying the alcohol-induced changes in behavior and neurochemistry is speculative at this point, the results suggest that zebrafish will be a useful tool for the analysis of the biological mechanisms of alcohol-induced functional changes in the adult brain.","[Gerlai, R.; Chatterjee, D.; Pereira, T.; Sawashima, T.; Krishnannair, R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",,"Gerlai, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Rm 3035,3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",robert_gerlai@yahoo.com,,,"NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01 AA015325-01A2, R01 AA015325] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA015325] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,52,107,110,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1601-1848,1601-183X,,GENES BRAIN BEHAV,Genes Brain Behav.,AUG,2009,8,6,,,,,586,599,,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2009.00488.x,,,14,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,479JJ,WOS:000268655200003,19243447,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2022-04-19,

We aimed to evaluate the effect of jaguar (Panthera onca) feces as a repellent for a free-living urban population of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), which are considered a vertebrate pest in some regions of their range. Observational data were collected during two consecutive 5-day periods: control and treatment. Scan samples within a 2-h observational session were carried out, recording capybara incursions into a 15 m x 15 m marked perimeter and alertness behavioral state. During the treatment period, 30 g of jaguar feces were added daily every 5.0 m around the perimeter in four selected areas (around Lake Paranoa, Brasilia, Brazil) frequented by capybara. The presence of predator feces induced changes in capybaras' behavior as there was a decrease in actual presence at the sites as a whole with the presence of jaguar feces. Of those capybaras that did continue to visit a site, incursions into the marked perimeter were initially greatly reduced, but did rebound relatively rapidly over the trial period. Although our results showed that capybaras recognize jaguar's feces as a predator threat, odor habituation may limit the repellent's efficacy at a local level, but appeared to have a longer term effect on the overall numbers of capybara visiting a site in general. Improvements in this technique will be required for it to become practicable, to reinforce capybaras' aversion to predators, to decrease their habituation to predator's feces, and to provide more humanitarian control.","[Ruiz-Tagle, Natalia Mendez; Knowles, Toby G.] Univ Bristol Langford, Sch Vet Sci, Bristol BS40 5DU, Avon, England; [Nogueira-Filho, Sergio Luiz Gama; Siqueira da Cunha Nogueira, Selene] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Dept Biol Sci, Rod Jorge Amado Km 16, BR-45662900 Ilheus, BA, Brazil; [Nogueira-Filho, Sergio Luiz Gama; Siqueira da Cunha Nogueira, Selene] Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Ilheus, BA, Brazil",,"Nogueira, SSD (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Dept Biol Sci, Rod Jorge Amado Km 16, BR-45662900 Ilheus, BA, Brazil.; Nogueira, SSD (corresponding author), Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Ilheus, BA, Brazil.",selene@uesc.br,"Knowles, Toby G/A-2026-2008; Nogueira, Selene/I-1843-2013","Knowles, Toby G/0000-0002-3845-0942; Nogueira-Filho, Sergio/0000-0001-5392-0773; Nogueira, Selene/0000-0001-8078-4172","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel-Brazil (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88881.119854/2016-01, 88881.119838/2016-01]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [303448/2019-9, 04226/2019-0]","Selene Siqueira da Cunha Nogueira and Sergio Luiz Gama Nogueira-Filho received a grant from Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel-Brazil (CAPES) (Process #88881.119854/2016-01 and #88881.119838/2016-01, respectively).

Both roadway traffic noise and naturally-occurring river noise engender similar changes in behavior. These results suggest that noisy environments, natural and human-created, alter important risk-management behaviors in sparrows and possibly other birds. Animals glean information about risk from their habitat. The acoustic environment is one such source of information, and is an important, yet understudied ecological axis. Although anthropogenic noise has become recently ubiquitous, risk mitigation behaviors have likely been shaped by natural noise over millennia. Listening animals have been shown to increase vigilance and decrease foraging in both natural and anthropogenic noise. However, direct comparisons could be informative to conservation and understanding evolutionary drivers of behavior in noise. Here, we used 27 song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) and 148 laboratory behavioral trials to assess foraging and vigilance behavior in both anthropogenic and natural noise sources. Using five acoustic environments (playbacks of roadway traffic, a whitewater river, a whitewater river shifted upwards in frequency, a river with the amplitude modulation of roadway traffic, and an ambient control), we attempt to parse out the acoustic characteristics that make a foraging habitat risky. We found that sparrows increased vigilance or decreased foraging in 4 of 6 behaviors when foraging in higher sound levels regardless of the noise source or variation in frequency and amplitude modulation. These responses may help explain previously reported declines in abundance of song sparrows exposed to playback of intense river noise. Our results imply that natural soundscapes have likely shaped behavior long before anthropogenic noise, and that high sound levels negatively affect the foraging-vigilance trade-off in most intense acoustic environments. Given the ever-increasing footprint of noise pollution, these results imply potential negative consequences for bird populations.","[Sweet, K. A.; Sweet, B. P.; Gomes, D. G. E.; Barber, J.

However, fitness-influencing behaviours, such as mating, can alter risk and influence predator-prey space-use dynamics. In tree crickets,Oecanthus henryi, mate searching involves acoustic signalling by immobile males and phonotactic movement by females. Space-use patterns in tree crickets relative to their primary predators, green lynx spiders (Peucetia viridans), should therefore depend on their current mate-searching state; whether males are calling or non-calling and whether females are phonotactic or non-phonotactic. We first measured the degree of spatial anchoring of crickets to specific bushes in the field and determined whether that influenced the probability of broad-scale spatial overlap with spiders. In the absence of spiders, all crickets, independent of sex or male calling status, were found to be spatially anchored to specific types of bushes and not uniformly distributed on the landscape. At the broad spatial scale, spiders were more likely to be found on bushes with female crickets and, to a lesser degree, calling male crickets. At a finer spatial scale within a bush, movement strategies of crickets not only varied depending on the presence or absence of a spider, but also on their current mate-searching state. Phonotactic females showed clear predator avoidance, whereas calling and non-calling males moved towards the spider instead of away, similar to predator inspection behaviour seen in many taxa. As the strongly selected sex, males are more likely to undertake risky mate-searching activities, which includes inspection of predator positions. Overall, we found that all crickets were predictably anchored at the landscape scale, but their sex and mate-seeking behaviour influenced the degree of overlap with predators and their antipredator movement strategies. Reproductive strategies within a prey species, therefore, can alter predator-prey space race at multiple spatial scales.","[Torsekar, Viraj R.; Thaker, Maria] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Torsekar, Viraj R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Torsekar, VR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.; Torsekar, VR (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",viraj.torsekar@mail.huji.ac.il,"Torsekar, Viraj/AAX-8471-2021","Torsekar, Viraj/0000-0001-6096-6454; Thaker, Maria/0000-0001-6019-2639","DBT-IISc partnership programme of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of IndiaMinistry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India","We thank the DBT-IISc partnership programme of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for funding the research and publication charges.

It is practically important to discriminate between true and false (or misperceived) effectiveness of interventions as false perceptions may shape a wrong conservation agenda and lead to inappropriate decisions and management actions. This study used the false positive risk (FPR) to estimate the rates of misperceived effectiveness of electric fences (overstated if reported as effective but actually ineffective based on FPR; understated otherwise), explain their causes and propose recommendations on how to improve the representation of true effectiveness. Electric fences are widely applied to reduce damage to fenced assets, such as livestock and beehives, or increase survival of fenced populations. The analysis of 109 cases from 50 publications has shown that the effectiveness of electric fences was overstated in at least one-third of cases, from 31.8% at FPR = 0.2 (20% risk) to 51.1% at FPR = 0.05 (5% risk, true effectiveness). In contrast, understatement reduced from 23.8% to 9.5% at these thresholds of FPR. This means that truly effective applications of electric fences were only 48.9% of all cases reported as effective, but truly ineffective cases were 90.5%, implying that the effectiveness of electric fences was heavily overstated. The main reasons of this bias were the lack of statistical testing or improper reporting of test results (63.3% of cases) and interpretation of marginally significant results (p < 0.05, p < 0.1 and p around 0.05) as indicators of effectiveness (10.1%). In conclusion, FPR is an important tool for estimating true effectiveness of conservation interventions and its application is highly recommended to disentangle true and false effectiveness for planning appropriate conservation actions. Researchers are encouraged to calculate FPR, publish its constituent statistics (especially treatment and control sample sizes) and explicitly provide test results with p values. It is suggested to call the effectiveness true if FPR < 0.05, suggestive if 0.05 <= FPR < 0.2 and false if FPR >= 0.2.","[Khorozyan, Igor] Georg August Univ, Dept Conservat Biol, Gottingen, Germany",,"Khorozyan, I (corresponding author), Georg August Univ, Dept Conservat Biol, Gottingen, Germany.",igor.khorozyan@biologie.uni-goettingen.de,,"Khorozyan, Igor/0000-0002-0657-7500",,,,63,0,0,1,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 5,2021,16,8,,,,,,,e0255784,10.1371/journal.pone.0255784,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,UA6JF,WOS:000685265700122,34352882,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-04-19,

Changes in the biotic and abiotic environment associated with urbanization can alter this trade-off and modify foraging decisions. We experimentally manipulated foraging opportunities for two Anolis lizard species - the brown anole (A. sagrei) in Florida and the crested anole (A. cristatellus) in Puerto Rico - to assess whether foraging behavior differs between habitats varying in their degree of urbanization. In both urban and natural forest habitats, we measured the latency of perched anoles to feed from an experimental feeding tray. We manipulated perch availability and predator presence, while also taking into account population (e.g., conspecific density) and individual-level factors (e.g., body temperature) to evaluate whether and how these contribute to between-habitat differences in foraging behavior. In both species, urban anoles had longer latencies to feed and lower overall response rates compared to lizards from forests. Urban anoles were also larger (i.e., snout-vent length and mass) in both species and urban A. sagrei were in better body condition than the natural forest population. We postulate that the observed patterns in foraging behavior are driven by differences in perceived predation risk, foraging motivation, or neophobia. Although we are unable to identify the mechanism(s) driving these differences, the substantial differences in urban versus forest anole foraging behavior emphasizes the importance of understanding how urbanization influences animal populations and their persistence in anthropogenically-modified environments.","[Chejanovski, Zachary A.; Aviles-Rodriguez, Kevin J.; Lapiedra, Oriol; Preisser, Evan L.; Kolbe, Jason J.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Aviles-Rodriguez, Kevin J.] Univ Massachusetts Boston, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Lapiedra, Oriol] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Chejanovski, ZA (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",zchejanovski@gmail.com,,"Lapiedra, Oriol/0000-0003-0383-0061; Aviles Rodriguez, Kevin/0000-0002-6720-6690",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354897]; University of Rhode Island; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1354897] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,This research was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (DEB-1354897) and funds from the University of Rhode Island.

Based on 10 Global Positioning System-collared wolves in a protected area of central Italy, we investigated wolf responses to anthropogenic features such as roads and settlements by using Step and Resource Selection Functions. We revealed that responses by wolves to anthropogenic features varied according to behavioural state (travelling vs. resting) and social affiliation (pack members vs. floaters), while accounting for seasonal and circadian effects. During summer, pack members strongly avoided roads and settlements throughout all day, both when travelling and resting, and complemented this response by selecting forested areas and shrublands. Conversely, during fall and winter, pack members relaxed the avoidance towards anthropogenic features by travelling closer to main roads and settlements, but they still selected resting sites farther from anthropogenic features and located them in denser cover and along steeper slopes. Compared to pack members, floaters, when travelling, showed a weaker avoidance of main roads and settlements and did not show any selection pattern towards environmental variables. When resting, contrary to pack members, floaters selected sites closer to main roads and settlements, even though these were still located along denser cover and steeper slopes. Our findings suggest that wolves living in human-modified landscapes adapt behaviourally to the spatial and temporal distribution of perceived interference by humans and that their response is complementary to the expected seasonal and circadian variation in human activity. These adaptations appear to be aided by the selection of habitat features that enhance security and allow segregation from humans. Maintenance of such habitat characteristics appears of critical importance to ensure the functionality of behavioural adaptations by wolves living in human-modified landscapes.","[Mancinelli, S.; Falco, M.; Boitani, L.; Ciucci, P.] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,"Mancinelli, S (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",sara.mancinelli@uniroma1.it,"Ciucci, Paolo/C-7677-2009","Ciucci, Paolo/0000-0002-0994-3422",Wildlife Conservation Society,"This work was supported by a private U.S. donor through the Wildlife Conservation Society.

The asexual part of its life cycle can be perpetually sustained in a variety of intermediate hosts through a combination of carnivory and vertical transmission. However, T. gondii produces gametes only in felids after the predation of infected intermediate hosts. The parasite changes the behavior of its intermediate hosts by reducing their innate fear to cat odors and thereby plausibly increasing the probability that the definitive host will devour the infected host. Here, we provide a short description of such parasitic behavioral manipulation in laboratory rodents infected with T. gondii, along with a bird's eye view of underpinning biological changes in the host. We also summarize critical gaps and opportunities for future research in this exciting research area with broad implications in the transdisciplinary study of host-parasite relationships.","[Tong, Wen Han; Vyas, Ajai] Nanyang Technol Univ SBS NTU, Sch Biol Sci, 60 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Pavey, Chris] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Land & Wat, Darwin, NT, Australia; [O'Handley, Ryan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Anim & Vet Sci, Roseworthy Campus, Roseworthy, Australia",,"Vyas, A (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ SBS NTU, Sch Biol Sci, 60 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637551, Singapore.",avyas@ntu.edu.sg,"; Vyas, Ajai/A-2223-2011","Tong, Wen Han/0000-0001-7726-9604; Vyas, Ajai/0000-0002-2592-6796; Pavey, Chris/0000-0003-2162-8019",Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP0062/2018]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,This manuscript was supported by Human Frontier Science Program (RGP0062/2018).

There is substantial variation in the severity and persistence of cancer-related fatigue that may be driven by individual differences in host factors, including characteristics that predate the cancer experience as well as responses to cancer and its treatment. This review examines biobehavioral risk factors linked to fatigue and the mechanisms through which they influence fatigue across the cancer continuum, with a focus on neuro-immune processes. Among psychosocial risk factors, childhood adversity is a strong and consistent predictor of cancer-related fatigue; other risk factors include history of depression, catastrophizing, lack of physical activity, and sleep disturbance, with compelling preliminary evidence for loneliness and trait anxiety. Among biologic systems, initial work suggests that alterations in immune, neuroendocrine, and neural processes are associated with fatigue. The identification of key risk factors and underlying mechanisms is critical for the development and deployment of targeted interventions to reduce the burden of fatigue in the growing population of cancer survivors. Given the multidimensional nature of fatigue, interventions that influence multiple systems may be most effective.","[Bower, Julienne E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bower, Julienne E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Bower, Julienne E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Cousins Ctr Psychoneuroimmunol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Bower, Julienne E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",,"Bower, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Bower, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.; Bower, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Cousins Ctr Psychoneuroimmunol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Bower, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Jonsson Comprehens Canc Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",jbower@ucla.edu,,,"Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF); National Cancer InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R01 CA160427, R01 CA200977]; Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R01CA200977, R01CA160427] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Julienne E.

Specifically, we compared wild boar behavior under contrasting conditions of human pressure, within the primeval temperate forest of Bialowieza (eastern Poland) and the metropolitan area of Cracow (Poland). It was predicted that, compared with the forest, wild boar within the urban area will have smaller home ranges due to restricted space, will show longer daily movements due to patchy resources, and will exhibit increased nocturnal activity and ranging behavior in an attempt to avoid human interference. We used radiotracking data from 35 wild boar. Animals inhabiting the urban area had smaller home ranges, yet covered almost twice as much distance on a daily basis than individuals inhabiting primeval forest. Daily duration of activity was similar in the 2 study areas. However, distribution of activity throughout the day differed considerably. In the urban area wild boar were almost exclusively nocturnal, whereas in the primeval forest wild boar activity was evenly distributed throughout the day. Additionally, in the urban area, activity was strongly associated with traveling speed, whereas in the primeval forest active wild boar moved about to little extent. Seasonal effects were stronger in the primeval forest and affected daily distance traveled, duration of activity, and level of diurnality. This study showed that wild boar can adjust their spatiotemporal behavior to local conditions and this may be one factor explaining recent rapid demographic expansion in Europe.","[Podgorski, Tomasz; Jedrzejewska, Bogumila; Soennichsen, Leif; Jedrzejewski, Wlodzimierz] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Bas, Grzegorz; Sniezko, Stanislaw; Okarma, Henryk] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Soennichsen, Leif] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, D-10315 Berlin, Germany",,"Podgorski, T (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.",t_podgorski@ibs.bialowieza.pl,"Podgórski, Tomasz/B-4869-2015; Okarma, Henryk/W-2050-2019","Podgórski, Tomasz/0000-0001-6858-7838; Okarma, Henryk/0000-0002-8912-3546; Jedrzejewska, Bogumila/0000-0002-9652-0953; Sniezko, Stanislaw/0000-0002-0350-9676","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [2 P04F 073 29]","The project was funded by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (grant No. 2 P04F 073 29).

Recent studies indicate the consumptive effects of large reef predators are too diffuse to elicit trophic cascades. Here, we provide evidence that such predators can produce non-consumptive (fear) effects that flow through herbivores to shape the distribution of seaweed on a coral reef. This trophic cascade emerged because reef topography, tidal oscillations, and shark hunting behaviour interact to create predictable hot spots of fear on the reef where herbivores withhold feeding and seaweeds gain a spatial refuge. Thus, in risky habitats, sharks can exert strong ecological impacts even though they are trophic generalists that rarely feed. These findings contextualize the debate over whether predators influence coral reef structure and function and move us to ask not if, but under what specific conditions, they generate trophic cascades.","[Rasher, Douglas B.] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, 60 Bigelow Dr, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA; [Hoey, Andrew S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, 1 James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, 950 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Hay, Mark E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Aquat Chem Ecol Ctr, 950 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",,"Rasher, DB (corresponding author), Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, 60 Bigelow Dr, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA.",drasher@bigelow.org,"Hoey, Andrew S/B-5457-2015; Hay, Mark E/D-9752-2011","Hay, Mark E/0000-0002-6130-9349; Hoey, Andrew/0000-0002-4261-5594",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE0929119]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U19TW007401]; Teasley Endowment; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE130100688]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [U19TW007401] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank the Fijian Government and Korolevu-i-wai Environmental Committee for research permissions.

Developing relevant animal models whereby many variables can be efficiently controlled is thus essential to understanding this elusive relationship. Here, we use our repeated unpredictable stress (RUS) paradigm, in combination with our established mouse model of repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI), to assess the impact of repeated exposures to these paradigms on behavioral and neurobiological measures. C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to RUS and r-mTBI at 3 and 6 months of age followed by batteries of behavioral testing. Mice were euthanized 10 days and 3 months post-exposure, with brain and plasma samples collected for molecular profiling. The RUS paradigm involved exposure to a predator odor (trimethylthiazoline; TMT) while under restraint, daily unstable social housing, five inescapable footshocks on separate days, and chronic social isolation. Animals receiving r-mTBI ( x 5) and stress were exposed to a single closed-head injury 1 h after each footshock. Stress-alone mice showed significant weight loss, recall of traumatic memories, and anxiety-like and passive stress-coping behavior when compared with control mice. However, in stress+r-mTBI animals, the changes in cued fear memory, anxiety, and stress-coping tests were diminished, possibly due to TBI-induced hyperactivity. We also report complex brain molecular and neuropathological findings. Stress and r-mTBI, either individually or comorbidly, were associated with a chronic reduction in dendritic spine GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in the hippocampus. While stress augmented the r-mTBI-dependent astrogliosis in the corpus callosum, it mitigated r-mTBI-induced increases in hippocampal pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We anticipate that our model will be a good platform to untangle the complex comorbid pathophysiology in stress disorders and r-mTBI.","[Algamal, Moustafa; Saltiel, Nicole; Pearson, Andrew J.; Ager, Bryan; Burca, Ioana; Mouzon, Benoit; Mullan, Michael; Ojo, Joseph O.; Crawford, Fiona] Roskamp Inst, 2040 Whitfield Ave, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Algamal, Moustafa; Pearson, Andrew J.; Mullan, Michael; Ojo, Joseph O.; Crawford, Fiona] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Saltiel, Nicole; Mouzon, Benoit; Ojo, Joseph O.; Crawford, Fiona] James A Haley Vet Hosp, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Diamond, David M.] Univ S Florida, Dept Psychol Mol Pharmacol & Physiol, Tampa, FL USA",,"Algamal, M (corresponding author), Roskamp Inst, 2040 Whitfield Ave, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA.",elgamal.mostafa@gmail.com,,"Algamal, Moustafa/0000-0002-6215-0122",Roskamp Foundation; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 MH109655-0],This work was funded by The Roskamp Foundation.

We measured key characteristics of all tree species in which agile gibbons slept, including exposure of the tree crown, root system, height, species and presence of food. Gibbons most frequently slept in Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae trees and preferentially chose trees taller than average, slept above the mean canopy height and showed a preference for liana-free trees. These choices could reflect avoidance of competition with other frugivores, but we argue these choices reflect gibbons prioritizing avoidance of predation. The results highlight that gibbons are actively selecting and rejecting sleeping trees based on several characteristics. The importance of the presence of large trees for food is noted and provides insight into gibbon antipredatory behaviour. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

We develop a model to explore the interaction between different ecological constraints on group sizes, using a primate (baboons) case study. The model uses climatic correlates of time budgets to predict maximum ecologically tolerable group size, and climatic predictors of predation risk (reflected mainly in predator density and female body mass) to predict minimum tolerable group size for any given habitat. As well as defining the range of sustainable group sizes for a given habitat, the model also allows us to reliably predict our exemplar taxon's biogeographical distribution across Africa. We also explore the life history implications of the model to ask whether baboons form group sizes which maximise survival or fecundity in the classic trade off between these two key life history variables. Our results indicate that, within the range of study sites in our sample, baboons prefer to maximise fecundity. However, the data indicate that in higher predation risk habitats they would switch to maximising survival at the expense of fecundity. We argue that this is due to the fact that interbirth interval and developmental rates have a ceiling that cannot be breached. Thus, while females can shorten interbirth intervals to compensate for increased predation risk, there is a limit to how much these life history variables can be altered, and when this is reached the best strategy is to maximise survivorship.

In adults, the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) appears to be involved in fear expression, whereas the infralimbic mPFC mediates fear extinction. In juvenile rats (PN26), the mPFC receives information on potential predators but does not act on it To test whether the prefrontal cortex is capable of fear regulation in the young organism, we exposed juvenile rats to a threatening or nonthreatening stimulus and assessed fear and brain Fos activation of the mPFC subdivisions, amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG). In response to the threat, juveniles froze more, spent more time far from the threat, and had elevated numbers of Fos-positive cells in the prelimbic mPFC, the medial amygdala, and ventral PAG. To test the hypothesis that the mPFC has a dual role in modulating the amygdala and FAG in juveniles, we pharmacologically disinhibited each of the two subdivisions of the mPFC and assessed freezing and downstream activation to the threat Juvenile rats infused with picrotoxin into the prelimbic mPFC and exposed to a threatening stimulus froze less, spent less time far from the threat, and increased Fos expression. Infusion of picrotoxin into the infralimbic mPFC also reduced fear responding to the threatening stimulus but had no effect on Fos expression. In sum, it appears that the mPFC can process threatening stimuli in juveniles at this age, even though it is normally not involved in the fear responses.","[Kabitzke, Patricia A.; Shair, Harry N.; Wiedenmayer, Christoph P.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kabitzke, Patricia A.; Shair, Harry N.; Wiedenmayer, Christoph P.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Dev Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Barr, Gordon A.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Barr, Gordon A.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chan, Thomas] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA",,"Kabitzke, PA (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, 1051 Riverside Dr,Unit 40, New York, NY 10032 USA.",pak2130@columbia.edu,"Barr, Gordon/N-1288-2013","Barr, Gordon/0000-0003-4751-9937","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [CPW: R21 MH073994, R01 MH071751, ARRA R01 MH07175151]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH073994, R01MH071751] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","When Christoph Wiedenmayer suddenly died in the spring of 2010, a group of his colleagues and students dedicated themselves to completing his research in progress.

However, at least seven ecological and sociological considerations must be addressed before dog populations are positively managed. 1. Domestication and feralisation of dingoes have resulted in behavioural changes that continue to expose a broad range of native and introduced fauna to predation. 2. Dingoes and other dogs are classic mesopredators, while humans are the apex predator and primary ecosystem engineers in Australia. 3. Anthropogenic landscape changes could prevent modem dingoes from fulfilling their pre-European roles. 4. Dingoes are known to exploit many of the same species they are often presumed to 'protect', predisposing them to present direct risks to many threatened species. 5. The assertion that contemporary dog control facilitates the release of mesopredators disregards the realities of effective dog control, which simultaneously reduces fox and dog abundance and is unlikely to enable increases in fox abundance. 6. The processes affecting threatened fauna are likely a combination of both top-down and bottom-up effects, which will not be solved or reversed by concentrating efforts on managing only predator effects. 7. Most importantly, human social and economic niches are highly variable across the ecosystems where dingoes are present or proposed. Human perceptions will ultimately determine acceptance of positive dingo management. Outside of an adaptive management framework, positively managing dingoes while ignoring these seven considerations is unlikely to succeed in conserving native faunal biodiversity but is likely to have negative effects on ecological, social and economic values.","[Fleming, Peter J.

A lack of basic information about wild dog movement ecology hampers efficient planning and allocation of resources to mitigate human-wild dog conflicts. We captured, collared and released 37 wild dogs in urban areas of north-eastern Australia to investigate their movement ecology. In general, wild dogs occupied small fragments of bushland within an urban matrix, were active at all times of the day, and lived within a few hundred meters of houses and humans at all times. We conclude that wild dog management strategies in urban areas should focus on the mitigation of impacts at the individual or group level, and not population-level reductions in numbers. Top-predators around the world are becoming increasingly intertwined with humans, sometimes causing conflict and increasing safety risks in urban areas. In Australia, dingoes and dingo x domestic dog hybrids are common in many urban areas, and pose a variety of human health and safety risks. However, data on urban dingo ecology is scant. We GPS-collared 37 dingoes in north-eastern Australia and continuously monitored them each 30 min for 11-394 days. Most dingoes were nocturnal, with an overall mean home range size of 17.47 km(2). Overall mean daily distance travelled was 6.86 km/day. At all times dingoes were within 1000 m of houses and buildings. Home ranges appeared to be constrained to patches of suitable vegetation fragments within and around human habitation. These data can be used to reallocate dingo management effort towards mitigating actual conflicts between humans and dingoes in urban areas.","[McNeill, Alice T.; Leung, Luke K. -P.] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia; [Goullet, Mark S.] FeralsOut, Kippa Ring, Qld 4021, Australia; [Gentle, Matthew N.; Allen, Benjamin L.] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Biosecur Queensland, Robert Wicks Pest Anim Res Ctr, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Allen, Benjamin L.] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",,"Allen, BL (corresponding author), Dept Agr & Fisheries, Biosecur Queensland, Robert Wicks Pest Anim Res Ctr, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.; Allen, BL (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",alice.mcneill@uqconnect.edu.au; luke.leung@uq.edu.au; mark.goullet@feralsout.com; Matthew.Gentle@daf.qld.gov.au; benjamin.allen@usq.edu.au,"Allen, Benjamin L./H-3066-2019","Allen, Benjamin L./0000-0002-1533-0163; Leung, Luke/0000-0002-8829-4925","Invasive Animals Cooperative Research CentreAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Brisbane City Council; Logan City Council; Somerset Regional Council; Moreton Bay Regional Council; Gold Coast City Council; Sunshine Coast Regional Council; Biosecurity Queensland (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries)","We were assisted in wild dog trapping by officers from Gold Coast City Council, Moreton Bay Regional Council, Sunshine Coast Regional Council, Townsville Regional Council and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

However, some measures may have unforeseen negative consequences on individual species. Herding, a management practice currently used in some wildlife species to protect animals from poachers, can cause habituation to humans, which unintentionally might increase their risk of being poached at a later time. Herding could also negatively impact animal welfare and physiology when perceived as a stressor, with potential negative consequences at the individual and population level. In this study, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) herding elicits habituation to humans in white rhino, and 2) this practice affects the behavior and physiological state of rhino, but they can habituate to it. To that aim, we investigated the effects of herding on the response of rhino to initially unfamiliar people, expression of aggressive and discomfort behaviors, and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations (a commonly used indicator of physiological stress) in two cohorts of six and 10 semi-wild orphan white rhino. Rhino did not interrupt their activity to an approaching person on foot (99%) or in a vehicle (94%), indicating habituation to humans. Aggressive and discomfort behaviors were displayed more often while being herded, and their frequency increased significantly with increasing herding pressure. Finally, overall mean fGCM concentrations were 16.1% higher under herding compared to non-herding conditions, but individual fGCM levels varied up to 17-fold under each scenario, suggesting that herding might not elicit a physiological stress response in these animals. While rhino security is paramount in the current poaching crisis, management practices must ensure that they do not impact negatively at the individual and population level.","[Fabregas, Maria C.; Meyer, Leith C.

However, in apparent contradiction with this well-established optimality model, birds and mammals generally initiate escape soon after beginning to monitor an approaching threat, a phenomena codified as the ``Flush Early and Avoid the Rush'' (FEAR) hypothesis. Typically, the FEAR hypothesis is tested using correlational statistics and is supported when there is a strong relationship between the distance at which an individual first responds behaviorally to an approaching predator (alert distance, AD), and its flight initiation distance (the distance at which it flees the approaching predator, FID). However, such correlational statistics are both inadequate to analyze relationships constrained by an envelope (such as that in the AD-FID relationship) and are sensitive to outliers with high leverage, which can lead one to erroneous conclusions. To overcome these statistical concerns we develop the phi index (W), a distribution-free metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of a 1: 1 relationship in a constraint envelope (the prediction of the FEAR hypothesis). Using both simulation and empirical data, we conclude that W is superior to traditional correlational analyses because it explicitly tests the FEAR prediction, is robust to outliers, and it controls for the disproportionate influence of observations from large predictor values (caused by the constrained envelope in AD-FID relationship). Importantly, by analyzing the empirical data we corroborate the strong effect that alertness has on flight as stated by the FEAR hypothesis.","[Samia, Diogo S.

Because the occurrence of a stressful life event cannot be foreseen, characterizing the temporal trajectory of its neural manifestations in humans has been a real challenge. The current prospective study examined the emotional experience and brain responses of 50 a priori healthy new recruits to the Israeli Defense Forces at 2 time points: before they entered their mandatory military service and after their subsequent exposure to stressful events while deployed in combat units. Over time, soldiers reported on increase in stress symptoms that was correlated with greater amygdala and hippocampus responsiveness to stress-related content. However, these closely situated core limbic regions exhibited different temporal trajectories with regard to the stress effect; whereas amygdala's reactivity before stress predicted the increase in stress symptoms, the hippocampal change in activation over time correlated with the increase in such symptoms. Hippocampal plasticity was also reflected by a modification over time of its functional coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and this coupling magnitude was again predicted by predated amygdala reactivity. Together, these findings suggest that variations in human's likelihood to develop symptomatic phenomena following stressful life events may depend on a balanced interplay between their amygdala's predisposing reactivity and hippocampal posteriori intra- and interregional plasticity. Accordingly, an individually tailored therapeutic approach for trauma survivors should target these 2 neural probes while considering their unique temporal prints.","[Admon, Roee; Stern, Orit; Rosenberg, Keren; Sela, Lee; Ben-Ami, Haim; Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Funct Brain Ctr, Wohl Inst Adv Imaging, IL-46239 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Admon, Roee; Rosenberg, Keren; Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lubin, Gad] Israeli Def Forces, Med Corps, Dept Mental Hlth, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Psychol, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",,"Hendler, T (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Funct Brain Ctr, Wohl Inst Adv Imaging, Witzman 6, IL-46239 Tel Aviv, Israel.",hendlert@gmail.com,"hendler, talma/C-7677-2012",,"Israeli Ministry of Science and Sport; Israeli Defense Forces; Levy Edersheim Gitter Institute for Neuroimaging; Adams Super Center for Brain Studies, Tel Aviv University","We thank Dr. D.

Quantifying these benefits is rare, yet can lead to innovative conservation solutions. To assess these benefits, we examined the feeding ecology and population size of peri-urban spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in Mekelle, Ethiopia. We integrated these field data into a disease transmission model to predict: (a) the number of anthrax and bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections arising in humans and livestock from infected carcass waste and (b) the costs associated with treating these infections and losing livestock. We compared these public health and economic outcomes under two scenarios: (a) hyenas are present and (b) the counterfactual, hyenas are absent. We estimated that hyenas annually remove 4.2% (207 tonnes) of the total carcass waste disposed of by residents and businesses in Mekelle. Furthermore, the scavenging behaviour of hyenas annually prevents five infections of anthrax and bTB in humans, and 140 infections in cattle, sheep and goats. This disease control service potentially saves USD 52,165 due to the treatment costs and livestock loss avoided. Synthesis and applications. This human-hyena interaction in Ethiopia is evidence that large carnivores can contribute to human health and economy. To retain these benefits and maintain tolerance of hyenas, we recommend introducing education programmes to promote safe outdoor behaviour around hyenas, training watchdogs to alert residents of hyena presence, constructing bomas to protect livestock from hyena attacks, and preserving the hyenas' access to carcass waste to reduce their dependency on livestock predation. With humans and carnivores coming more frequently into contact, understanding and communicating how these species can benefit humanity will be critical to motivating human-carnivore coexistence worldwide.","[Sonawane, Chinmay] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yirga, Gidey] Mekelle Univ, Dept Biol, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Carter, Neil H.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Sonawane, C (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",sonawane@stanford.edu,,"Carter, Neil/0000-0002-4399-6384","Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, Harvard University","We thank Haile Gerigis, Mekelle University and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation for providing field support, and the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, Harvard University for providing financial support.",,46,1,1,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Golden marmots are preyed on by globally-endangered predators such as the snow leopard, and are baited by humans with dogs, potentially causing FID to increase. We measured FID in 72 marmots from four colonies in the Karakoram range, Pakistan. Marmots were approached by a person on foot with a leashed dog, and by a person on their own to compare FID between the two. Additionally, we recorded background signs of human activity, namely roads, and presence of people other than the experimenters. We measured other aspects of the environment that might have affected marmot behavior such as marmot group size and age/sex, how visible each colony was, and colony substrate. The dog caused greater FID than the person alone, and adult marmots nearer to roads showed greater FID. However, marmot age and colony substrate had more marked impacts on FID, which was also greater at lower elevations where there were clusters of human settlements and livestock pasture. Further research should be conducted to explore some of these effects further and to find out whether increased FID affects marmot survival and breeding success. Humans and dogs initiate measurable escape responses in wild animals including flight initiation distance (FID), with potentially negative consequences. Golden marmots are important prey for endangered carnivores and are subject to human persecution including via marmot baiting with dogs. We quantified FID at four marmot colonies (72 individuals) in the Karakoram range, Pakistan in response to approach by a pedestrian with a leashed dog versus approach by a pedestrian alone (i.e., a control). Additionally, we related FID to background variables of human activity, namely proximity to roads, and presence of other pedestrians in the vicinity of study sites during sampling. We also controlled for potential environmental and social covariates (e.g., group size, age and sex, and colony substrate). Dogs initiated greater FID than pedestrians alone, and there was evidence that roads increased FID. However, these effects were weaker than those of marmot age and colony substrate. FID was greater at lower elevations, but this may reflect the clustering in these zones of human settlements and livestock pasture. Further work is needed elucidate the importance of colony substrate (linked to ease of human persecution), the effect of settlements and pasture, and the impact of increased FID on marmot fitness.","[Zaman, Muhammad; Zhu, Mengyan; Jiang, Guangshun] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr, Chinese State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Tolhurst, Bryony A.] Univ Brighton, Ecol Conservat & Zoonosis Res & Enterprise Grp, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England",,"Jiang, GS (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr, Chinese State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",jgshun@126.com,"Tolhurst, Bryony/AAT-9022-2020","Tolhurst, Bryony/0000-0002-0198-5046; Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017PZ14]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31872241, 31572285]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; Northeast Forestry University Harbin China","This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2572017PZ14), The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 31872241; 31572285).

Several of these behaviors have been described in detail, often in the laboratory, but we know little about the factors that influence their expression and effectiveness in the field, especially against real predators. Thus, one question that we might ask is: How effective are humans and artificial stimuli as proxies for real predators? Other areas that would profit from further research include the role of color and pattern in avoidance of predation, the effect of injury on subsequent survival, growth, or other measures of demographic performance, the role of previous experience in shaping future antipredator behavior, and the links among fear, stress physiology, and antipredator behavior.","[Gregory, Patrick T.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Gregory, Patrick T.] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",,"Gregory, PT (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.; Gregory, PT (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",viper@uvic.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"I thank E.

Growing evidence focused on human-altered acoustic environments suggests that anthropogenic noise can strongly interfere with the reception of biologically relevant sounds, causing a variety of behavioural changes in response to the evolutionarily novel acoustic conditions created by humans. However, little is known about how background natural sounds, such as river noise and biotic choruses, alter behaviour. Using field-placed playback of predominantly low-frequency whitewater river rapids, higher-frequency cicada choruses (similar to 7.0-15.0 kHz) or a silent control, we sought to determine whether background natural sounds influence vigilance and foraging behaviour in the California ground squirrel. We found that California ground squirrels exposed to low-frequency river sounds increased vigilance and decreased foraging and movement relative to ambient acoustic conditions during control trials and, to a lesser extent, acoustic conditions imposed by the cicada chorus playback. Additionally, vigilance increased with sound level regardless of whether the playback stimulus was the low-frequency river noise or the high-frequency cicada chorus. However, background sound level interacted with group size, such that increased sound levels were associated with a strong increase in vigilance in small groups but not in larger groups. To our knowledge these results are the first to demonstrate that the spectral content and amplitude of natural sounds can influence vigilance and movement behaviours. Yet our results match those from recent studies reporting increased vigilance in response to low-frequency anthropogenic noise, suggesting that many observed responses to anthropogenic sounds may be those that animals have used to cope with variable sound levels from natural sources throughout their evolutionary history. Determining how natural sounds influence other key behaviours is ripe for future studies and will likely prove useful for predicting behavioural adjustments in response to an increasingly noisy world.

We collected data for 2 years at 93 study sites along 3 transects of urbanization using motion-triggered cameras. Our primary objective was to determine the relationship among coyote and deer spatial and temporal distribution, habitat characteristics, and human activity using multi-season patch occupancy models. Coyote occupancy was most strongly linked to rates of site visitation by humans and dogs, and was more likely farther from the urban center, with coyote colonization of sites inversely related to road density, housing density, and human and dog site visitation. Deer more frequently occupied sites with high canopy cover near water sources and colonized smaller sites with reduced housing density and human and dog presence. Expected predator-prey dynamics were altered in this highly urban system. Though we predicted deer would avoid coyotes on the landscape based on an ecology of fear framework, deer and coyote occupancy showed a strong positive association. We suggest that a scarcity of quality habitat in urban areas may cause the species to co-occupy habitat despite potential fawn predation. Modifying human foot traffic in green spaces may represent a useful tool for management and conservation of large urban mammals.","[Magle, Seth B.; Lehrer, Elizabeth W.] Lincoln Pk Zoo, Urban Wildlife Inst, Dept Conservat & Sci, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Simoni, Leah S.; Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",,"Magle, SB (corresponding author), Lincoln Pk Zoo, Urban Wildlife Inst, Dept Conservat & Sci, Chicago, IL 60614 USA.",SMagle@lpzoo.org,,"Magle, Seth/0000-0003-0275-3885",University of Illinois at Chicago; Lincoln Park Zoo; Davee Foundation,"We thank M.

When animals deal with potential predators by mobbing them, constant assessment is needed to consider whether to approach, mob or withdraw. When presented with a taxidermic specimen of a monitor lizard, the magpies assembled on the ground close to the lizard and circled, pecked, jumped over, viewed and approached, or withdrew from it. Using video footage, the monocular fixations prior to or during performance of these activities were scored and the following significant eye preferences were found. Prior to withdrawing, the magpies viewed the lizard with the left eye (LE) (85% of events). Prior to approaching, the right eye (RE) was used (72%). Hence, the left hemisphere is used to process visual inputs prior to approaching the predator and the right hemisphere prior to withdrawing from it. This result is consistent with hemispheric specialization shown in other species, including humans. The LE was used also prior to jumping (73%) and prior to circling (65%), as well as during circling (58%) and for high alert inspection of the predator (72%). Mobbing and perhaps circling are agonistic responses controlled by the LE/right hemisphere, as also seen in other species. Alert inspection involves detailed examination of the predator and likely high levels of fear, known to be right hemisphere function. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

When rats are exposed to a natural predator they display stress- and anxiety-related behavioral alterations and physiological activation. To develop a preclinical rodent model to study mechanisms underlying human BI and anxiety, we examined the extent to which ferret exposure elicits anxiety-related BI and HPA and amygdala activation of the CRF system. In the first experiment, BI and other behaviors were assessed in the presence or absence of a ferret. In the second experiment, ferret-induced corticosterone release and changes in brain c-fos expression were assessed. In the final experiment, gene chip and quantitative real time-PCR analyses were performed on amygdala tissue from control and ferret-exposed rats. Ferret exposure increased BI and submissive posturing, as well as plasma corticosterone and the number of Fos-positive cells in several brain regions including the amygdala. Gene expression analysis revealed increased amygdalar mRNA for CRF-binding protein, but not the CRF, receptor, CRF2 receptor or CRE In rodents, ferret exposure can be used to elicit anxiety-related BI, which is associated with HPA and amygdala activation. Since the amygdala and the CRF system have been implicated in adaptive and maladaptive anxiety responses in humans, these data support use of our rodent model to further investigate mechanisms underlying anxiety-related psychopathology in humans.

Fatal black bear attacks occurred in Canada and Alaska (n = 49) and in the lower 48 states (n = 14). There were 3.5 times as many fatal attacks in Canada and Alaska but only 1.75 times as many black bears, and much less human contact for black bears in Canada and Alaska. There was a weak positive correlation (r(s) = 0.56, P <= 0.000) between the estimated size of a bear population within a given jurisdiction and the number of fatal black bear attacks. Some jurisdictions had no fatal black bear attacks but had large estimated black bear populations. Of fatal attacks, 86% (54 of 63, 1.08/yr) occurred between 1960 and 2009. There was positive linear relationship between the number of fatal black bear attacks per decade and human population size in the United States and Canada per decade (r(2) = 0.92, beta = 0.000, P <= 0.001). Of fatal attacks, 91% (49 of 54) occurred on parties of 1 or 2 persons. In 38% (15 of 40) of incidents, peoples' food or garbage probably influenced the bear being in the attack location. We judged that the bear involved acted as a predator in 88% (49 of 56) of fatal incidents. Adult (n = 23) or subadult (n = 10) male bears were involved in 92% (33 of 36) of fatal predatory incidents, reflecting biological and behavioral differences between male and female bears. That most fatal black bear attacks were predatory and were carried out by 1 bear shows that females with young are not the most dangerous black bears. As a result of our research agencies managing black bear can more accurately understand the risk of being killed by a black bear, and can communicate this to the public. With training, people can learn to recognize the behaviors of a bear considering them as prey and can act to deter predation.

When multiple types occur, the optimal antipredator response level may be determined solely by the probability of attack by the relevant predator: specific responsiveness. Conversely, an increase in the probability of attack by one predator type might increase responsiveness to an alternative predator type: general wariness. We formulate a mathematical model in which a prey animal perceives a cue providing information on the probability of two predator types being present. It can perform one of two evasive behaviors that vary in their suitability as a response to the wrong predator type. We show that general wariness is optimal when incorrect behavioral decisions have differential fitness costs. Counter-intuitively, difficulty in discriminating between predator types does not favor general wariness. We predict that where responses to predator types are mutually exclusive (e.g., referential alarm-calling), specific responsiveness will occur; we suggest that prey generalize their defensive responses based on cue similarity due to an assumption of response utility; and we predict, with relevance to conservation, that habituation to human disturbance should generalize only to predators that elicit the same antipredator response as humans.","[Brilot, Ben O.; Bateson, Melissa; Nettle, Daniel] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Behav & Evolut, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England; [Whittingham, Mark J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Biol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",,"Brilot, BO (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Ctr Behav & Evolut, Inst Neurosci, Henry Wellcome Bldg,Framlington Pl, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4HH, Tyne & Wear, England.",ben.brilot@ncl.ac.uk,"Bateson, Melissa/AAE-7075-2022; Nettle, Daniel/B-2259-2008; Brilot, Ben/M-9074-2019; Read, Jenny/A-7493-2013; Brilot, Ben/C-6435-2008; Bateson, Melissa/B-1874-2008","Bateson, Melissa/0000-0002-0861-0191; Nettle, Daniel/0000-0001-9089-2599; Brilot, Ben/0000-0002-2124-080X; Read, Jenny/0000-0002-9029-5185; Brilot, Ben/0000-0002-2124-080X; Bateson, Melissa/0000-0002-0861-0191",UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E012000/1]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission [UF041260]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E012000/1] Funding Source: researchfish; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/E012000/1] Funding Source: UKRI,"We thank A.

Roads are a prevalent, ever-increasing form of human disturbance on the landscape. In many places in western North America, energy development has brought human and road disturbance into seasonal winter range areas for migratory elk. 2. We sought to evaluate the predictions from the risk-disturbance hypothesis when studying elk response to roads during winter. Road proximity and crossing were used to evaluate these behaviours, which offered a rare comparison between two common measures of roads. We used integrated step selection analysis (iSSA) to evaluate four alternative hypotheses regarding the influence of roads on space-use behaviour across 175 elk-years of elk telemetry data, and we quantified both population-level and individual-level variations in responses. 3. We demonstrated, for the first time, how iSSA can be used to combine movement analysis in a refined approach to habitat selection. Elk responded to roads as they would natural predation risk. Elk selected areas farther from roads at all times of day with avoidance being greatest during twilight. In addition, elk sought cover and moved more when in the vicinity of roads. Road crossings were generally avoided, but this avoidance was weakest during daytime when elk were both moving and closer to roads. 4. Synthesis and applications. Energy development is transforming landscapes in western North America with the proliferation of roads, which we show is having substantial and multifaceted negative effects on elk movement and behaviour. These adverse effects can be mitigated by minimizing new road construction and by restricting traffic on roads as well as providing the protection of tree cover on elk winter ranges.","[Prokopenko, Christina M.; Boyce, Mark S.; Avgar, Tal] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, CW 405 Biolog Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada",,"Prokopenko, CM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, CW 405 Biolog Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",prokopen@ualberta.ca,"Avgar, Tal/W-9520-2019; Boyce, Mark S/A-2620-2014","Avgar, Tal/0000-0002-8764-6976; Boyce, Mark S/0000-0001-5811-325X",Royal Dutch ShellRoyal Dutch Shell; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Safari Club International - Northern Alberta Chapter; Alberta Fish and Game Association; Banting PDF,"Funding was provided by Royal Dutch Shell and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Safari Club International - Northern Alberta Chapter, and the Alberta Fish and Game Association.

Although predator-prey interactions increasingly occur in habitats that experience multiple forms of human-generated disturbance, it is unclear how different forms of disturbance might affect antipredator behavior. Fire is a contemporary disturbance that has dramatic effects on terrestrial habitats. Such habitats may have also experienced past disturbances, like agricultural land use, that leave lasting legacies on habitat structure (e.g., overstory and understory composition). It is unclear how these past and present disturbances affect the use of different antipredator behaviors, like temporal avoidance and vigilance. We examined whether variation in disturbance regimes generates differences in ungulate antipredator behavior by using cameras to measure white-tailed deer vigilance and activity time across 24 longleaf pine woodlands that vary in past land use and contemporary fire regime. Regardless of land-use history, woodlands with high fire frequencies had 4 times less vegetation cover than low-fire woodlands, generating riskier habitats for deer; however, deer responded to fire with different antipredator strategies depending on land-use history. In nonagricultural woodlands, fire affected deer activity time such that activity was nocturnal in low-fire woodlands and crepuscular in high-fire woodlands. In post-agricultural woodlands, fire affected vigilance and not activity time such that deer were more vigilant in high-fire woodlands than in low-fire woodlands. These results suggest that ungulate antipredator behavior may vary spatially depending on past land use and contemporary fire regime, and such disturbances may generate landscapes of fear that persist for decades after agricultural use.","[Bartel, Savannah L.; Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, 363 Birge Hall,430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Bartel, SL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, 363 Birge Hall,430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",bartel2@wisc.edu,,"Bartel, Savannah/0000-0001-5735-262X",American Society of Mammalogists; Department of Energy -Savannah River Operations Office through the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service -Savannah River [DE-EM0003622]; Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [RC-2705]; University of Wisconsin Vilas Fellowship,This work was supported by the American Society of Mammalogists through a Grants-in-Aid of Research award to SLB; by the Department of Energy -Savannah River Operations Office through the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service -Savannah River under Interagency Agreement DE-EM0003622; by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (Project RC-2705); and by a University of Wisconsin Vilas Fellowship to JLO.,,102,1,1,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.
