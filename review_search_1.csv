Fear of humans has been proposed to act as a substitute, but new research identifies humans as a super predator globally far more lethal to mesocarnivores, and thus presumably far more frightening. Although much of the world now consists of human-dominated landscapes, there remains relatively little research regarding how behavioral responses to humans affect trophic networks, to the extent that no study has yet experimentally tested the relative fearfulness mesocarnivores demonstrate in reaction to humans versus nonhuman predators. Badgers (Meles meles) in Britain are a model mesocarnivore insofar as they no longer need fear native large carnivores (bears, Ursus arctos; wolves, Canis lupus) and now perhaps fear humans more. We tested the fearfulness badgers demonstrated to audio playbacks of extant (dog) and extinct (bear and wolf) large carnivores, and humans, by assaying the suppression of foraging behavior. Hearing humans affected latency to feed, vigilance, foraging time, number of feeding visits, and number of badgers feeding. Hearing dogs and bears had far lesser effects on latency to feed, and hearing wolves had no effects. Our results indicate fear of humans evidently cannot substitute for the fear large carnivores inspire in mesocarnivores because humans are perceived as far more frightening, which we discuss in light of the recovery of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.","[Clinchy, Michael; Zanette, Liana Y.; Roberts, Devin; Suraci, Justin P.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Suraci, Justin P.] Raincoast Conservat Fdn, Sidney, BC V8L 3Y3, Canada; [Buesching, Christina D.; Newman, Chris; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House, Tubney OX13 5QL, England",,"Clinchy, M (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",mclinchy@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; UK People's Trust for Endangered Species Grant,This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants to M.C. and L.Y.Z. and a UK People's Trust for Endangered Species Grant to D.W.M.,,56,73,74,12,98,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

This has led to recent endeavours to promote the transparency, rigour, and ultimately, replicability of research. Originating from this zeitgeist, the challenge to discuss critical issues on terminology, design, methods, and analysis considerations in fear conditioning research is taken up by this work, which involved representatives from fourteen of the major human fear conditioning laboratories in Europe. This compendium is intended to provide a basis for the development of a common procedural and terminology framework for the field of human fear conditioning. Whenever possible, we give general recommendations. When this is not feasible, we provide evidence-based guidance for methodological decisions on study design, outcome measures, and analyses. Importantly, this work is also intended to raise awareness and initiate discussions on crucial questions with respect to data collection, processing, statistical analyses, the impact of subtle procedural changes, and data reporting specifically tailored to the research on fear conditioning.

It has yet to be experimentally tested if fear of humans has comparably large effects on the feeding behavior of large herbivores. We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing white-tailed deer to the vocalizations of humans, extant or locally extirpated non-human predators (coyotes, cougars, dogs, wolves), or non-predator controls (birds), at supplemental food patches to measure the relative impacts on deer feeding behavior. Deer were more than twice as likely to flee upon hearing humans than other predators, and hearing humans was matched only by hearing wolves in reducing overall feeding time gaged by visits to the food patch in the following hour. Combined with previous, site-specific research linking deer fecundity to predator abundance, this study reveals that fear of humans has the potential to induce a larger effect on ungulate reproduction than has ever been reported. By demonstrating that deer most fear the human 'super predator', our results point to the fear humans induce in large ungulates having population- and community-level impacts comparable to those caused by the fear humans induce in large carnivores.","[Crawford, Daniel A.; Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Dept Rangeland & Wildlife Sci, 700 Univ Blvd,MSC 218, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Crawford, Daniel A.; Conner, L.

One frequently used paradigm is measurement of the acoustic startle reflex under conditions that mimic anxiogenic and fear-related conditions. For example, fear-potentiated startle is the relative increase in the frequency or magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex in the presence of a previously neutral cue (e.g., colored shape; termed the conditioned stimulus or CS+) that has been repeatedly paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (e.g., airblast to the larynx). Our group has recently used fear-potentiated startle paradigms to demonstrate impaired fear extinction in civilian and combat populations with PTSD. In the current study, we examined the use of either auditory or visual CSs in a fear extinction protocol that we have validated and applied to human clinical conditions. This represents an important translational bridge in that numerous animal studies of fear extinction, upon which much of the human work is based, have employed the use of auditory CSs as opposed to visual CSs. Participants in both the auditory and visual groups displayed robust fear-potentiated startle to the CS+, clear discrimination between the reinforced CS+ and non-reinforced CS-, significant extinction to the previously reinforced CS+, and marked spontaneous recovery. We discuss the current results as they relate to future investigations of PTSD-related impairments in fear processing in populations with diverse medical and psychiatric histories.","[Norrholm, Seth D.; Anderson, Kemp M.; Olin, Ilana W.; Kwon, Cliffe; Warren, Victor T.; McCarthy, Alexander; Bosshardt, Lauren; Sabree, Justin; Duncan, Erica J.; Bradley, Bekh] Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line, Trauma Recovery Program, Decatur, GA 30033 USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Anderson, Kemp M.; Olin, Ilana W.; Jovanovic, Tanja; Kwon, Cliffe; Warren, Victor T.; McCarthy, Alexander; Bosshardt, Lauren; Duncan, Erica J.; Rothbaum, Barbara O.; Bradley, Bekh] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Sabree, Justin] Oglethorpe Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Norrholm, SD (corresponding author), Atlanta Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line 116A, 1670 Clairmont Rd,Suite 1E 113C, Decatur, GA 30033 USA.",snorrho@emory.edu,"Duncan, Erica/B-1671-2016; Bradley, Bekh/H-8399-2012; Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022","Bradley, Bekh/0000-0003-1838-0702; McCarthy, Ilana/0000-0002-3305-2478","National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD)French National Research Agency (ANR)NARSAD; Department of Defense (DoD)/Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) [W81XWH-08-2-0170]; Emory University Research Committee; PHS Grant from the Clinical and Translational Science Award Program [UL1 RR025008]; National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR); NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH092576, U19MH069056-03, R34MH083078-01A1, 1R01MH70880-01-A2]; NARSADNARSAD; Emory Care Medical Foundation; National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [1R01DA018294-01A2]; VA Merit Review ProgramUS Department of Veterans Affairs; Department of Defense Clinical Trial GrantUnited States Department of Defense [W81XWH-10-1- 1045]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000454] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [UL1RR025008] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Dr. Norrholm has research support from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD), the Department of Defense (DoD)/Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP; # W81XWH-08-2-0170), the Emory University Research Committee, and the PHS Grant (UL1 RR025008) from the Clinical and Translational Science Award Program, National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources.

Where both disturbance types co-occur, disentangling their impacts remains a challenge. Disturbance effects may interact such that species respond to increased human footprint by either reducing (habituation) or increasing (sensitization) avoidance of human presence. We experimentally manipulated perceived human presence, using playbacks of people talking, across a gradient of human footprint in California's Santa Cruz Mountains and used camera traps to quantify the behavioral responses of bobcats (Lynx rufus), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), mesopredators known to exhibit strong fear response to human presence, but which vary in their use of developed areas. Bobcats and skunks reduced activity in response to human playbacks but showed no change in responsiveness to playbacks across the gradient of human footprint, suggesting that these species are similarly fearful of humans at all infrastructure development levels tested. Opossums exhibited a significant interaction between human footprint and playback treatment such that reductions in activity level in response to human playbacks were strongest at higher levels of building density. Our results indicate that, rather than habituating to human presence some mesopredators retain a strong fear of humans or become more fearful when inhabiting more developed areas. We suggest that consistently high responsiveness to immediate human presence may benefit mesopredators living in human-dominated landscapes by mitigating the risk of anthropogenic mortality. Mesopredators remain fearful of humans, whether they are in remote, protected areas, or in the backyards of densely populated suburbs. Using an experimental approach, we show that bobcats and striped skunks exhibit a consistent fear response to people, regardless of level of human footprint. Meanwhile, Virginia opossums exhibit heightened fear in areas of high human disturbance. Maintaining a strong fear response to humans may help mesopredators coexist in human-dominated landscapes.","[Reilly, Chloe M.; Suraci, Justin P.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, Truckee, CA 96161 USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wang, Yiwei] San Francisco Bay Bird Observ, 524 Valley Way, Milpitas, CA 95035 USA",,"Reilly, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",cmreilly@ucsc.edu,,,Resources Legacy Fund; Peninsula Open Space Trust,"This work was supported by the Resources Legacy Fund and the Peninsula Open Space Trust.

Oxytocin reduces anxiety and impacts on fear conditioning and extinction. Recently, oxytocin administration in humans was shown to increase trust, suggesting involvement of the amygdala, a central component of the neurocircuitry of fear and social cognition that has been linked to trust and highly expresses oxytocin receptors in many mammals. However, no human data on the effects of this peptide on brain function were available. Here, we show that human amygdala function is strongly modulated by oxytocin. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to image amygdala activation by fear-inducing visual stimuli in 15 healthy males after double-blind crossover intranasal application of placebo or oxytocin. Compared with placebo, oxytocin potently reduced activation of the amygdala and reduced coupling of the amygdala to brainstem regions implicated in autonomic and behavioral manifestations of fear. Our results indicate a neural mechanism for the effects of oxytocin in social cognition in the human brain and provide a methodology and rationale for exploring therapeutic strategies in disorders in which abnormal amygdala function has been implicated, such as social phobia or autism.","NIMH, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Univ Giessen, Ctr Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Cognit Neurosci Grp, D-35385 Giessen, Germany; NIMH, Neuroimaging Core Facil, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; NIMH, Unit Syst Neurosci Psychiat, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Meyer-Lindenberg, A (corresponding author), NIMH, Clin Brain Disorders Branch, Genes Cognit & Psychosis Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 10-3C103,9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",andreasml@nih.gov,"Kirsch, Peter/C-2499-2008; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas/H-1076-2011","Kirsch, Peter/0000-0002-0817-1248; Mier, Daniela/0000-0003-2518-7492; Lis, Stefanie/0000-0002-8051-2756; Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas/0000-0001-5619-1123",Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [Z01MH002867] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,39,1116,1134,7,282,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Extinguished fear often reappears after extinction through spontaneous recovery. Animal studies suggest that spontaneous recovery can be abolished if extinction occurs within minutes of acquisition. However, a limited number of human extinction studies have shown that short interval extinction does not prevent the return of fear. For this reason. we performed an in-depth parametric analysis of human fear extinction using fear-potentiated startle. Using separate single-cue and differential conditioning paradigms, participants were fear conditioned and then underwent extinction either 10 min (Immediate) or 72 hr (Delayed) later. Testing for spontaneous recovery occurred 96 hr after acquisition. In the single cue paradigm, the Immediate and Delayed groups exhibited differences in context, but not fear, conditioning. With differential conditioning, there were no differences in context conditioning and the Immediate group displayed less spontaneous recovery. Thus, the results remain inconclusive regarding spontaneous recovery and the timing of extinction and are discussed in terms of performing translational studies of fear in humans.","[Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja; Boshoven, William; Davis, Michael; Rothbaum, Barbara; Duncan, Erica J.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja; Boshoven, William; Duncan, Erica J.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30033 USA; [Vervliet, Bram] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Vervliet, Bram] Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Louvain, Belgium; [Myers, Karyn M.] Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Norrholm, SD (corresponding author), Atlanta VAMC, 1670 Clairmont Rd,MHSL 116A, Decatur, GA 30033 USA.",seth.norrholm@va.gov,"Jovanovic, Tanja/K-4095-2014; Duncan, Erica/B-1671-2016; Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022; Vervliet, Bram/AAE-6276-2019","Jovanovic, Tanja/0000-0002-6456-0053; Vervliet, Bram/0000-0002-5904-4257","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R24 MH067314, 1R24MH067314-01A1, P50 MH058922, R37 MH047840, R37 MH47840, 2P50 MH058922] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH047840, R24MH067314, P50MH058922] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,41,81,83,1,18,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

We examined whether a threat-relevant predator odor (2-methyl-2-thiazoline) would contextually enhance the formation of human fear memory associations. Participants who learned to associate visual stimuli with electric shock in this predator odor context later showed stronger fear responses to the visual stimuli than participants who learned in an aversiveness-matched control odor context. This effect generalized to testing in another odor context, even after extinction training. Results of a separate experiment indicate that a possible biological mechanism for this effect may be increased cortisol levels in a predator odor context. These results suggest that innate olfactory processes can play an important role in human fear learning. Modulatory influences of odor contexts may partly explain the sometimes maladaptive persistence of human fear memory, e.g., in post-traumatic stress disorders.","[Taylor, Jessica E.; Lau, Hakwan; Kawato, Mitsuo; Koizumi, Ai] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback DecNef, Computat Neurosci Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Lau, Hakwan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Lau, Hakwan] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychol, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Seymour, Ben; Kawato, Mitsuo; Koizumi, Ai] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Osaka, Japan; [Seymour, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Computat & Biol Learning Lab, Cambridge, England; [Seymour, Ben] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Cognit Mech Labs, Dept Neural Computat Decis Making, Kyoto, Japan; [Nakae, Aya] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Osaka, Japan; [Sumioka, Hidenobu] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Hiroshi Ishiguro Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Koizumi, Ai] Sony Comp Sci Labs Inc, Tokyo, Japan",,"Taylor, JE; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Dept Decoded Neurofeedback DecNef, Computat Neurosci Labs, Kyoto, Japan.; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks CiNet, Osaka, Japan.; Koizumi, A (corresponding author), Sony Comp Sci Labs Inc, Tokyo, Japan.",jessie.elizabeth.taylor@gmail.com; bellkoizumi@gmail.com,"Sumioka, Hidenobu/AAA-7026-2021","Sumioka, Hidenobu/0000-0003-1511-9525; Kawato, Mitsuo/0000-0001-8185-1197","ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan); Brain/Mind Beyond program of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [JP19dm0307008]; JT presto [JPMJPR18J3]; Versus ArthritisVersus Arthritis [21537]","This work was supported by the ImPACT Program of Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan), by the Brain/Mind Beyond program of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (JP19dm0307008), by JT presto (JPMJPR18J3), and by Versus Arthritis: 21537.",,59,5,5,3,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

However, a significant number of patients fail to maintain their gains, partly attributed to the fact that this inhibitory learning and its maintenance is temporary and conditioned fear responses can return. Animal studies have shown that activation of the cannabinoid system during extinction learning enhances fear extinction and its retention. Specifically, CB1 receptor agonists, such as Delta 9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), can facilitate extinction recall by preventing recovery of extinguished fear in rats. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in humans. We conducted a study using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design, coupling a standard Pavlovian fear extinction paradigm and simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) recording with an acute pharmacological challenge with oral dronabinol (synthetic THC) or placebo (PBO) 2 h prior to extinction learning in 29 healthy adult volunteers (THC = 14; PBO = 15) and tested extinction retention 24 h after extinction learning. Compared to subjects that received PBO, subjects that received THC showed low SCR to a previously extinguished CS when extinction memory recall was tested 24 h after extinction learning, suggesting that THC prevented the recovery of fear. These results provide the first evidence that pharmacological enhancement of extinction learning is feasible in humans using cannabinoid system modulators, which may thus warrant further development and clinical testing.

This is exemplified by the renewal effect, where a change in the background context produces recovery of fear to a conditioned-and-extinguished stimulus. Renewal is the backbone of a widely accepted theory of extinction in animal research, as well as an important experimental model to screen novel treatment techniques. This has led to an explosion of fear renewal research in humans. However, the mere observation of return of fear in a renewal procedure is not sufficient to validate this particular theory of extinction in the tested sample/procedure. Here, we systematically outline a set of experimental tests that aid in evaluating alternative extinction/renewal mechanisms. We examine published renewal studies in human fear conditioning and conclude that the prevailing theory of extinction is often taken for granted, but critical tests are lacking. Including these tests in future research will not only reveal the fear extinction mechanism in humans, but also inspire further developments in extinction treatment research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In a first experiment, 18 animals were individually confronted with each of the 3 stimuli for 4 min (in a counter-balanced order). The results indicated that both the human and the human-like model elicited greater fear reactions than did the control, and that the former two stimuli did not differ in their fear-eliciting properties. In a second experiment designed to determine if the animals become aware of a difference between the human and the model over time, 32 animals were confronted successively with each of the two stimuli for 8 min. Although there was some habituation towards both stimuli, there was no difference between them even at the end of the test period. These results suggest that a model Could be appropriate in experiments involving human presence (at least for a short duration) and would allow for better standardization.

Humans have supplanted large carnivores as apex predators in many systems, and similarly pervasive impacts may now result from fear of the human 'super predator'. We conducted a landscape-scale playback experiment demonstrating that the sound of humans speaking generates a landscape of fear with pervasive effects across wildlife communities. Large carnivores avoided human voices and moved more cautiously when hearing humans, while medium-sized carnivores became more elusive and reduced foraging. Small mammals evidently benefited, increasing habitat use and foraging. Thus, just the sound of a predator can have landscape-scale effects at multiple trophic levels. Our results indicate that many of the globally observed impacts on wildlife attributed to anthropogenic activity may be explained by fear of humans.","[Suraci, Justin P.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Clinchy, Michael; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Suraci, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",justin.-suraci@gmail.com,,,Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank A.

Extinction does not erase the initial CS-US association, but is thought to form a new memory. After extinction training, extinction memory competes with conditioning memory for control of fear expression. Deficits in fear extinction are thought to contribute to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Herein, we review studies performed in rats showing that the medial prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in the retention and expression of extinction memory. We also review human studies indicating that prefrontal areas homologous to those critical for extinction in rats are structurally and functionally deficient in patients with PTSD. We then discuss how findings from rat studies may allow us to: (1) develop new fear extinction paradigms in humans, (2) make specific predictions as to the location of extinction-related areas in humans, and (3) improve current extinction-based behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders.

In the laboratory, extinction is a preferred method for the study of fear inhibition: however, in this paradigm the same stimulus causes both elicitation (excitation) and inhibition of fear, making it difficult to know whether an experimental manipulation that affects extinction does so by affecting one or both of these processes. For this reason, we sought to develop a behavioral procedure in humans that would render a stimulus primarily inhibitory. Methods: We adapted a conditional discrimination procedure (AX+/BX-), previously validated in animals, to a human fear-potentiated startle paradigm. Forty-one healthy volunteers were presented with one set of colored lights paired with the delivery of aversive airblasts to the throat (AX+) and a different series of light,,; Presented without airblasts (BX-). Results. Participants exhibited fear potentiation to AX+, discrimination between AX+ and BX-, and transfer of fear inhibition to A in an AB compound test but not in an AC compound test. Conclusions: We believe this procedure will advance Clinical research on fear disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and phobias, by providing an effective and relatively independent measure of fear potentiation and fear inhibition.","Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv 116A, Atlanta, GA 30033 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; Ctr Behav Neurosci, Atlanta, GA USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Jovanovic, T (corresponding author), Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv 116A, 1670 Clairmont Rd, Atlanta, GA 30033 USA.",tjovano@emory.edu,"Duncan, Erica/B-1671-2016; Jovanovic, Tanja/K-4095-2014","Jovanovic, Tanja/0000-0002-6456-0053","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37 MH47840, 1F32 MH070129-01A2, 1R24MH067314-01A1] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH070129, R37MH047840, R24MH067314] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,19,93,93,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Recent studies in animal models suggest that the degree to which one is able to control an aversive experience is a critical factor determining its behavioral consequences. In this study, we examined whether stressor controllability modulates subsequent conditioned fear expression in humans. Participants were randomly assigned to an escapable stressor condition, a yoked inescapable stressor condition, or a control condition involving no stress exposure. One week later, all participants underwent fear conditioning, fear extinction, and a test of extinction retrieval the following day. Participants exposed to inescapable stress showed impaired fear extinction learning and increased fear expression the following day. In contrast, escapable stress improved fear extinction and prevented the spontaneous recovery of fear. Consistent with the bidirectional controllability effects previously reported in animal models, these results suggest that one's degree of control over aversive experiences may be an important factor influencing the development of psychological resilience or vulnerability in humans.

The present study aims at examining questions motivated by this finding. We addressed the possibility that unilateral amygdala damage might be sufficient to impair recognition of emotional expressions. We also obtained further data on our subject with bilateral amygdala damage, in order to elucidate possible mechanisms that could account for the impaired recognition of expressions of fear. The results show that bilateral, but not unilateral, damage to the human amygdala impairs the processing of fearful facial expressions. This impairment appears to result from an insensitivity to the intensity of fear expressed by faces. We also confirmed a double dissociation between the recognition of facial expressions of fear, and the recognition of identity of a face: these two processes can be impaired independently, lending support to the idea that they are subserved in part by anatomically separate neural systems. Based on our data, and on what is known about the amygdala's connectivity, we propose that the amygdala is required to link visual representations of facial expressions, on the one hand, with representations that constitute the concept of fear, on the other. Preliminary data suggest the amygdala's role extends to both recognition and recall of fearful facial expressions.","SALK INST BIOL STUDIES,LA JOLLA,CA 92037",,"ADOLPHS, R (corresponding author), UNIV IOWA,COLL MED,DEPT NEUROL,DIV COGNIT NEUROSCI,200 HAWKINS DR,IOWA CITY,IA 52242, USA.",,"Damasio, Antonio/AAD-1342-2019","Tranel, Daniel/0000-0002-1338-1389",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [P01NS019632] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NINDS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [NS 19632] Funding Source: Medline,,,67,768,780,5,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513",0270-6474,,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves.

However, in humans the effects of stress on emotional memory are traditionally investigated by declarative memory tests (e.g., recall, recognition) for non-associative emotional stimuli (e.g., stories, pictures). Given that anxiety disorders are thought to originate from associative learning processes and are characterized by distressing emotional responses, the existing literature seems to be inconclusive for the understanding of these disorders. Here, we tested whether noradrenaline strengthens the emotional expression of associative fear memory by using a differential fear conditioning procedure in humans. Stimulation of the noradrenergic system by the administration of yohimbine HCl (20 mg) during memory formation did not directly augment the differential startle fear response 48 h later. Yet, the other retention tests uncovered that the administration of yohimbine HCl contrary to placebo pill extensively delayed the process of extinction learning and generated a superior recovery of fear (i.e., reinstatement and reacquisition). Conversely, the yohimbine HCl manipulation did not affect the skin conductance responding and the US expectancy ratings, emphasizing the concept of multiple memory systems. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration in humans that increased noradrenaline release during or shortly after a stressful event strengthens the formation of associative fear memory traces. The present findings suggest that noradrenaline may play an important role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Each of these categories may have a potential to reduce fear responses. The scientific literature on the effect of interventions addressing human fear of large carnivores is scarce and partly contradictory, which makes it difficult for wildlife managers to rely on current research when designing appropriate interventions.

Forty-nine participants were presented with two different contexts (switching on and off the central lighting of the experimental room). In the predictable context, a visual cue (CS I) was systematically followed by an electrocutaneous stimulus (US). In the unpredictable context, CS2 was presented explicitly unpaired with the US. Dependent variables were online US-expectancy ratings and fear-potentiated startle. First, in both measures, the results showed significantly more fear elicited by CS I than by CS2. Second, larger startle amplitudes during the intertrial intervals demonstrated more contextual fear in the unpredictable than in the predictable context. Hence, these findings illustrate that unpredictability increases contextual fear. Moreover, the US-expectancy ratings during the intertrial intervals were also higher in the unpredictable than in the predictable context.

The present study examined baseline and fear-potentiated startle eyeblink responses during a stranger-approach paradigm at age 9 months in a group of infants, some of whom displayed high motor activity and negative affect and some of whom displayed high motor activity and positive affect at 4 months. The analyses revealed that the high motor/high negative group of infants exhibited a significantly greater increase in fear-potentiated startle amplitude at 9 months compared with the high motor/high positive group. There were no differences among groups of infants on baseline startle responses. These findings suggest that the origins of behavioral inhibition in early childhood may be linked to a low threshold for arousal in forebrain limbic areas.

While many studies have used flight initiation distance as a proxy for fearfulness and examined the factors influencing the decision to flee, there is no general understanding of the relative importance of these factors. By identifying factors with large effect sizes, we can determine whether anti-predator strategies reduce fear, and we gain a unique perspective on the coevolution of predator and anti-predator behaviour. Based on an extensive review and formal meta-analysis, we found that predator traits that were associated with greater risk (speed, size, directness of approach), increased prey distance to refuge and experience with predators consistently amplified the perception of risk (in terms of flight initiation distance). While fish tolerated closer approach when in larger schools, other taxa had greater flight initiation distances when in larger groups. The presence of armoured and cryptic morphologies decreased perception of risk, but body temperature in lizards had no robust effect on flight initiation distance. We find that selection generally acts on prey to be sensitive to predator behaviour, as well as on prey to modify their behaviour and morphology.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Stankowich, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Anim Behav Grad Grp, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",tstankowich@ucdavis.edu,"Blumstein, Daniel T./B-6199-2012","Blumstein, Daniel T./0000-0001-5793-9244",,,,59,643,667,10,361,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

While there is considerable agreement about the participation of the amygdala in fear in both animals and humans, there are several issues about the function of the amygdala raised by the human research that have not been addressed by or may be answered by animal research. Three of these are addressed in this article: (1) is the amygdala involved in or necessary for both fear learning and unconditioned fear? (2) Does the amygdala code for intensity of fear? (3) Is the amygdala preferentially involved in fear, or is it also activated when there are no overt fear or aversive stimuli, but where the situation can be described as uncertain? We present evidence indicating that the rodent amygdala is involved in some types of fear (conditioned fear), but not all types (unconditioned fear), and may therefore have significance for a differential neurobiology of certain anxiety disorders in humans. Further, similar to the human amygdala, the rodent amygdala responds to varying intensities of aversive stimulation. Finally, it is suggested that, similar to humans, the rodent amygdala is involved in the evaluation of uncertainty. We conclude that progress on elucidating the role of the amygdala in fear is facilitated by corroboration of findings from both animal and human research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, it has yet to be experimentally tested if large carnivores perceive humans as predators and react strongly enough to have cascading effects on their prey. We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing pumas to predator (human) and non-predator control (frog) sounds at puma feeding sites to measure immediate fear responses to humans and the subsequent impacts on feeding. We found that pumas fled more frequently, took longer to return, and reduced their overall feeding time by more than half in response to hearing the human 'super predator'. Combined with our previous work showing higher kill rates of deer in more urbanized landscapes, this study reveals that fear is the mechanism driving an ecological cascade from humans to increased puma predation on deer. By demonstrating that the fear of humans can cause a strong reduction in feeding by pumas, our results support that non-consumptive forms of human disturbance may alter the ecological role of large carnivores.","[Smith, Justine A.; Suraci, Justin P.; Crawford, Ayana; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.; Clinchy, Michael; Roberts, Devin; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Smith, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",jsmith5@ucsc.edu,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Funding was provided by National Science Foundation grant #1255913, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",,30,85,87,13,118,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The eyeblink component of the startle reflex, elicited by an abrupt auditory stimulus, was measured in 9 normal volunteers during either the anticipation of electric shocks (anticipatory anxiety) or periods in which no shocks were anticipated (safe period). The eyeblink was consistently higher in amplitude, and shorter in latency, during periods when the subjects anticipated shocks, compared to the safe periods. This effect could not be attributed solely to a reduction in habituation and was statistically significant before the subjects actually received any shock (a single 30 mA stimulation on the median nerve). These results indicate that anticipatory anxiety can be measured objectively in humans using the fear-potentiated startle reflex in a paradigm not actually requiring any shock. Because a great deal is known about the neuroanatomical and pharmacological mechanisms of fear-potentiated startle in laboratory animals, this test procedure may be especially useful in humans to investigate the neurobiological substrates of anxiety disorders and their pharmacological treatments.","YALE UNIV,SCH MED,CONNECTICUT MENT HLTH CARE,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510",,"GRILLON, C (corresponding author), YALE UNIV,SCH MED,DEPT PSYCHIAT,GERU,40 TEMPLE ST LOWER LEVEL,NEW HAVEN,CT 06510, USA.",,/AAF-4811-2020,/0000-0002-3103-5228,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P01MH025642] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA007080] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA005348] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [5RO1 AA07080] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [1RO1 DA05348] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 25642] Funding Source: Medline,,,41,337,339,0,39,SOC PSYCHOPHYSIOL RES,WASHINGTON,"1010 VERMONT AVE NW SUITE 1100, WASHINGTON, DC 20005",0048-5772,,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,SEP,1991,28,5,,,,,588,595,,10.1111/j.1469-8986.1991.tb01999.x,,,8,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,GQ970,WOS:A1991GQ97000011,1758934,,,,2022-03-23,

Rat play was also suppressed shortly after they were exposed to cat odor in their home cage, and a substantial amount of risk assessment behavior was present up to 24 hr later. Trimethylthiazoline, a component found in fox feces, only reduced play during exposure.

However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS-E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS-N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS-) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.","[Sperl, Matthias F.

Here, we explored how the frequency and duration of predation risk affects postrisk fear behavior in Trinidadian guppies. We first exposed individuals to visual cues of potential predators for 3 days, either frequently (6x/day) or infrequently (1x/day). Each exposure lasted for either a relatively brief (5 min) or long 130 min) duration, whereas a control group consisted of no risk exposures. One day later, we quantified guppy behavior. All background risk treatments induced a fear response toward a novel odor (i.e., neophobia), and individuals previously exposed to frequent bouts of brief risk showed elevated baseline fear. Although neophobic responses were initially similar across risk treatments (1 day later), retention of this response differed. After 8 days, only individuals previously exposed to brief bouts of risk (both frequent and infrequent) maintained neophobic responses, whereas their initially higher level of baseline fear remained elevated but was no longer significantly different from the control. These results increase our understanding of temporal factors that affect the intensity and retention of fear that persists after risk exposure, which may have applications across vertebrates in relation to problems with fearful phenotypes.","[Crane, Adam L.; Feyten, Laurence E.

We aimed to elucidate interactions between subcortical and cortical regions in fear conditioning in humans. To do this, we used two fearful faces as conditioned stimuli (CS) and an electrical stimulation at the left hand, paired with one of the CS, as unconditioned stimulus (US). The luminance of the CS was rhythmically modulated leading to entrainment of brain oscillations at a predefined modulation frequency. Steady-state responses (SSR) were recorded by MEG. In addition to occipital regions, spectral analysis of SSR revealed increased power during fear conditioning particularly for thalamus and cerebellum contralateral to the upcoming US. Using thalamus and amygdala as seed-regions, directed functional connectivity was calculated to capture the modulation of interactions that underlie fear conditioning.

Human activities can indirectly shape this landscape of fear by altering behavior and spatial distribution of carnivores. We studied how red deer perceive the landscape of fear in an old-growth forest system (Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland) both at large and fine spatial scale. Camera traps were placed at locations with and without tree logs (fine-scale risk factor) and at different distances from the core of a wolf territory and human settlements (large-scale risk factor). Red deer avoided coming close to large tree logs and increased their vigilance levels when they were present in close vicinity. The strength of these effects depended on the distance to the wolf core area; deer perceived tree logs as more risky when wolves were more often present. Hence, tree logs inside wolf core areas create fine-scale patches of fear with reduced deer browsing pressure, thereby enhancing chances for successful tree recruitment. Human presence shapes this landscape of fear as wolf core areas are located far from human settlements. This human shadow on predator-prey interactions is therefore an important component that should be taken into account in human-dominated landscapes.","[Kuijper, Dries P.

Humans distinguish between fear and other emotional chemosignals based on olfactory cues. Here, we study the effect of human fear chemosignals on the speed and accuracy of cognitive performance. In a double-blind experiment, female participants performed a word-association task while smelling one of the three types of olfactory stimuli: fear sweat, neutral sweat, and control odor carrier. We found that the participants exposed to the fear condition performed more accurately and yet with no sacrifice for speed on meaningful word conditions than those under either the neutral or the control condition. At the same time, they performed slower on tasks that contained ambiguous content. Possible factors that could introduce bias, such as individual differences due to anxiety, verbal skills, and perceived qualities of the smells, were ruled out. Our results demonstrate that human fear chemosignals enhance cognitive performances in the recipient. We suggest that this effect originates from learned associations, including greater cautiousness and concomitant changes in cognitive strategies.","Rice Univ, Psychol Dept MS25, Houston, TX 77005 USA",,"Chen, D (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Psychol Dept MS25, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",xdchen@rice.edu,,,NIDCD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R03DC4956] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R03DC004956] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,71,85,88,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0379-864X,1464-3553,,CHEM SENSES,Chem.

A reconsolidation update paradigm was developed in which a reconsolidation window is opened by a single isolated retrieval trial of a previously reinforced CS+ which is then followed by Extinction Training within that window. However, follow-up studies in humans using multi-methods fear conditioning indices (e.g., fear-potentiated startle, skin conductance, US-expectancy) have failed to replicate the retrieval + extinction effects. In the present study, we further investigated the retrieval + extinction reconsolidation update paradigm by directly comparing the acquisition, extinction, and return of fear-potentiated startle in the absence or presence of US-expectancy measures (using a trial-by-trial response keypad) with and without retrieval of a previously acquired CS-US association. Participants were fear conditioned to two visual cue CS+'s, one of which was presented as a single, isolated retrieval trial before Extinction Training and one that was extinguished as usual. The results show that the inclusion of US-expectancy measures strengthens the CS-US association to provide enhanced fear conditioning and maintenance of fear memories over the experimental sessions. In addition, in the groups that used on-line US-expectancy measures, the retrieval + extinction procedure reduced reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle to both previously reinforced CS+'s, as compared to the extinction as usual group.

The recall of an extinction memory involves the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to exhibit deficits in this process. Furthermore, extinction forms the basis of exposure therapies commonly used to treat PTSD patients. It is possible that effective pharmacological and/or psychological treatment regimens could influence the activity of these regions, and thereby increase the ability to retain an extinction memory. However, to test this, a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm must demonstrate within-subject reproducibility over time. We, therefore, sought to test the within-subject reliability of a previously used 2-day, classical fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Methods: Eighteen healthy participants participated in a 2-day paradigm on three occasions, each separated by at least 12 weeks. Conditioning and extinction took place on Day 1, and extinction recall and fear renewal were evaluated on Day 2 on each of the three occasions. The conditioned stimulus was a visual cue and the unconditioned stimulus was a mild electric shock to the fingers. Skin conductance was recorded throughout the experiment to measure conditioned responses. Results: We found that conditioning and extinction recall were not significantly different across time and were correlated within subjects. Conclusion: These data illustrate the reliability of this paradigm and its potential usefulness in evaluating the influence of a given treatment on the fear extinction network in longitudinal within-subject designs.","[Milad, Mohammed R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Zeidan, Mohamed A.; Lebron-Milad, Kelimer; Thompson-Hollands, Johanna; Im, Jamie J.

As widespread apex predators, humans present a significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain lions Puma concolor to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Mendocino County, California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct, contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for prey. Our study highlights the importance of temporal partitioning as a mechanism of predation risk avoidance.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; McInturff, Alex; Brashares, Justin S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,,,California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Rhodes Trust; Safari Club International Foundation; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),California Department of Fish and Wildlife; Schmidt Science Fellows in partnership with Rhodes Trust; Safari Club International Foundation; National Science Foundation,,66,0,0,16,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Conditioned stimuli were paired with an aversive electric shock in one visual context and extinguished in a different context. Extinction recall and renewal were examined 24 h after training.

Fifty-five crossbred sows (Landrace x Large White x Duroc) of different parities and stages of pregnancy were each subjected to three tests-Test 0: response of free moving sows to a stationary observer in an open field test; Test S: response of sows in stalls to approaching hand contact; Test G: response of free moving sows in groups to approach by an observer. Each test was repeated after a period of no more than one week and sows behavioural responses were scored according to pre-determined scales of approach-withdrawal behaviour. Although previously validated in another study, Test 0 showed poor repeatability (r(s) = 0.153, P > 0.05), whereas repeatability was good for both Test S (r(s) = 0.777, P < 0.001) and Test G (r(s) = 0.628, P < 0.001). A Kendall coefficient of concordance suggested that there was no overall significant relationship among the three tests (W = 0.507, P > 0.05). Rank correlations showed a weak but significant relationship between Test 0 and Test S (r(s) = 0.270, P < 0.05), a stronger correlation between Test S and Test G (r(s) = 0.404, P < 0.01), but no significant correlation between Test 0 and Test G (r(s) = 0.197, P > 0.05). There were no significant effects of parity or stage of pregnancy on fear responses in any of the three tests. Since they are practical, repeatable and measure the same level of underlying fear of humans in sows, we recommend Test S and Test G for on-farm welfare assessment in different housing systems.

We found that participants clearly distinguished between disease-relevant and disease-irrelevant group of animals, and that females always scored higher than males. Moreover, there were associations between ratings of fear, disgust and danger and human anti-parasite behaviour.

Fear demands to be abated, countered or turned into something else, contributing and curtailing how we 'do' being human beings. This special issue of the European Journal of Cultural Studies addresses fear within media and popular culture, adopting a cultural studies approach to fear in a variety of socio-cultural and political contexts. A cultural studies approach allows us to enhance the horizon of understanding cultural practices, mediation and the subjective experience of fear as something we need to work through, in a process of recognition and shock, action and reaction, understanding and reflection. This focus on 'working through fear' offers new insights into the intensely subjective aspects of fear as it is creatively explored in representations within drama and documentary, photography and art, and in user-generated content, memes and political satire, and as it is embodied and experienced by people in the context of their realities. In addition, it shows how fear generates energy, anxiety and even desire. Rather than offering a generalizing account, this issue seeks to address fear in specific contexts, localities and from specific roles and perspectives.","[Hill, Annette] Lund Univ, Media & Commun, Lund, Sweden; [Mortensen, Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hermes, Joke] Inholland Univ, Practice Based Res Media Culture & Citizenship, Diemen, Netherlands",,"Hermes, J (corresponding author), Inholland Univ, NL-1110 AG Diemen, Netherlands.",joke.hermes@inholland.nl,"hermes, joke/Y-3967-2019","hermes, joke/0000-0002-4622-0696",Einar Hansen's Research Foundation through the grant Media and Fear (Lund University); Einar Hansen's Research Foundation through the grant Media and Fear (University of Copenhagen),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Einar Hansen's Research Foundation through the grant Media and Fear (Lund University and University of Copenhagen).",,17,0,0,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1367-5494,1460-3551,,EUR J CULT STUD,Eur.

The test is designed to measure the animals' fear of humans, assuming that broilers will withdraw from the observer if they are fearful. However, many broilers close to slaughter age have impaired walking ability, and the results from the touch test may thus be biased by lameness and poor leg health. As the touch test is currently being used in several countries to assess human-animal relationship in broilers, there is an urgent need to examine this potential relationship for a further validation of the test. In the present study, fear of humans was assessed in 50 randomly selected Norwegian broiler flocks, using the touch test as described in the Welfare Quality((R)) protocol for ty broilers. Leg health was assessed by examining the gait of 150 random birds in each of the flocks, using a six-point gait score scale from 0 to 5. The coefficient for the relationship between touch test score and gait score was 0.034 (P<0.001), indicating that the animals express less fear as assessed by the touch test when the gait scores increase. This implies that the touch test may be confounded by impaired walking ability and therefore might be a suboptimal method of assessing fear of humans and human-animal relationship in broilers. In conclusion, the results from this study suggests that the touch test must be further validated in broilers and perhaps be replaced with a fear test that doesn't rely on walking ability.","[Vasdal, G.] Norwegian Meat & Poultry Res Ctr, Lorenveien 38, N-0513 Oslo, Norway; [Moe, R.

Two hundred and thirty-two crossbred gilts and sows were studied and the tests were: HAT, behavioural response of sows individually held in an arena to a stationary experimenter (n = 232); HTA, behavioural response of sows in a group pent an approaching experimenter (n = 232); HTW, behavioural response of sows in a farrowing crate to an approaching experimenter (n = 116). The validated HAT has been used extensively in research to assess fear of humans in pigs and it has been consistently shown that handling treatments designed to differentially affect the pigs' fear of humans produced the expected variations in the approach behaviour of pigs to a stationary experimenter. However, the HAT is impractical for regular on-farm assessment of fear as it involves moving animals individually to an empty pen and is time consuming. There is no evidence in the literature of a well-validated practical test to assess fear of humans in sows in commercial settings and therefore the validity of the HTA and the HTW was investigated by examining their relationship with the HAT. A principal component (PCA) analysis was conducted on each data set for the HAT and HTA to identify a small set of factors for each test that represents the underlying relationships between the variables in each test. For each test a single 'factor' (Factor1HAT and Factor2HT(A)) was identified that provided an appropriate summary of the data. Only three behavioural variables were measured for the HTW, and as such were not suitable for PCA and therefore were treated individually. Spearman rank correlations were used to investigate the relationships between Factor1HAT and both Factor2HT(A) and the HTW variables. The effects of group, parity, time of day, test order in the HAT or HTA, test order in the penand experimenter on Factor1HAT, Factor2HT(A) and the three HTW variables were also studied. A low but significant correlation was found between the HTW and the HAT score (r = 0.24, P = 0.02), while a moderate significant correlation was found between the HAT and HTA scores (r = 0.37, P < 0.01). These relationships suggest that the HTA has reasonable validity; however, further research is required to modify the HTA in order to improve its validity while maintaining its feasibility.

Although ample research has shown that body odours can convey transient emotions like fear, these studies have exclusively treated emotions as categorical, neglecting the question whether emotion quantity can be expressed chemically. Using a unique combination of methods and techniques, we explored a dose-response function: Can experienced fear intensity be encoded in fear sweat? Specifically, fear experience was quantified using multivariate pattern classification (combining physiological data and subjective feelings with partial least-squares-discriminant analysis), whereas a photo-ionization detector quantified volatile molecules in sweat. Thirty-six male participants donated sweat while watching scary film clips and control (calming) film clips. Both traditional univariate and novel multivariate analysis (100% classification accuracy; Q(2): 0.76; R-2: 0.79) underlined effective fear induction. Using their regression-weighted scores, participants were assigned significantly above chance (83% > 33%) to fear intensity categories (low-medium-high). Notably, the high fear group (n = 12) produced higher doses of armpit sweat, and greater doses of fear sweat emitted more volatile molecules (n = 3). This study brings new evidence to show that fear intensity is encoded in sweat (dose-response function), opening a field that examines intensity coding and decoding of other chemically communicable states/traits.

Notably, there are 26 published studies (N = 1652) highlighting a human capacity to communicate fear, stress, and anxiety via body odor from one person (66% males) to another (69% females). The question is whether the findings of this literature reflect a true effect, and what the average effect size is. These questions were answered by combining traditional meta-analysis with novel meta-analytical tools, p-curve analysis and p-uniform-techniques that could indicate whether findings are likely to reflect a true effect based on the distribution of P-values. A traditional random-effects meta-analysis yielded a small-to-moderate effect size (Hedges' g: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.31-0.41), p-curve analysis showed evidence diagnostic of a true effect (ps < 0.0001), and there was no evidence for publication bias.

Most risk avoidance behaviors, such as temporal avoidance, have severe trade-offs between foraging efficiency and risk reduction. Human activities are able to affect the species landscape of fear, by increasing mortality of individuals (i.e. hunting, roadkill) and by disruption of the clues used by the species to estimate predation risk (e.g. light pollution). In this study, we used an extensive camera-trapping and night-time light satellite imagery to evaluate whether human activities affect the diel activity patterns of 17 species of rainforest dwelling mammals. We found evidence of diel activity shifts in eight of 17 analyzed species, in which five species become 21.6 % more nocturnal and three species become 11.7% more diurnal in high disturbed areas. This activity shifts were observed for both diurnal and nocturnal species. Persecuted species (game and predators) were more susceptible to present activity shifts. Since changes in foraging activity may affect species fitness, the behavior of humans' avoidance may be another driver of the Anthropocene defamation.","[Mendes, Calebe P.; Carreira, Daiane; Pedrosa, Felipe; Beca, Gabrielle; Lautenschlager, Lais; Akkawi, Paula; Berce, William; Galetti, Mauro] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Lab Biol Conservacao LABIC,UNESP, Ave 24A,1515, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Carreira, Daiane; Ferraz, Katia M.

In rats, brief electrical stimulation of the infralimbic cortex has been shown to reduce conditioned freezing during recall of extinction memory. Here, we translated this finding to humans with magnetic resonance imaging-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). METHODS: Subjects (N = 28) were aversively conditioned to two different cues (day 1). During extinction learning (day 2), TMS was paired with one of the conditioned cues but not the other. TMS parameters were similar to those used in rat infralimbic cortex: brief pulse trains (300 ms at 20 Hz) starting 100 ms after cue onset, total of four trains (28 TMS pulses). TMS was applied to one of two targets in the left frontal cortex, one functionally connected (target 1) and the other unconnected (target 2, control) with a human homologue of infralimbic cortex in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Skin conductance responses were used as an index of conditioned fear. RESULTS: During extinction recall (day 3), the cue paired with TMS to target 1 showed significantly reduced skin conductance responses, whereas TMS to target 2 had no effect. Further, we built group-level maps that weighted TMS-induced electric fields and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectivity estimates with fear level. These maps revealed distinct cortical regions and large-scale networks associated with reduced versus increased fear. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that spatiotemporally focused TMS may enhance extinction learning and/or consolidation of extinction memory and suggested novel cortical areas and large-scale networks for targeting in future studies.","[Raij, Tommi; Nummenmaa, Aapo; Setsompop, Kawin] MIT, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA USA; [Raij, Tommi; Nummenmaa, Aapo; Marin, Marie-France; Setsompop, Kawin; Milad, Mohammed R.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Marin, Marie-France; Porter, Daria; Furtak, Sharon; Milad, Mohammed R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Marin, Marie-France] Univ Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Dept Psychiat,Fac Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Furtak, Sharon] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Psychol, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",,"Raij, T (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Ctr Brain Stimulat, Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, 355 East Erie St, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.; Milad, MR (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, 1747 West Roosevelt Rd, Chicago, IL 60608 USA.",tommi.raij@northwestern.edu; milad@uic.edu,"Setsompop, Kawin/P-1464-2014; Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018","Setsompop, Kawin/0000-0003-0455-7634; Raij, Tommi/0000-0001-7439-7491","Department of Defense (DOD)United States Department of Defense [DM 102304]; National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R00EB015445, R00EB012107]; NIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Grant [P41EB015896]; NIH Shared Instrumentation GrantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10RR024694, S10RR023043]; Harvard Catalyst/Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center Grant [NCRR-NIH UL1 RR025758, NCRR-NIH UL1 TR000170]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000170] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [S10RR023043, UL1RR025758, S10RR024694, S10RR023401] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [P41EB015896, R00EB012107, R00EB015445] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the Department of Defense (DOD) Grant No. DM 102304 (to TR, M-FM, DP, SF, and MRM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant Nos.

We posit that during Mid-Paleolithic warfare an encounter with a stranger holding a sharp object was consistently associated with threat to life. A heritable hardwired or firm-wired (prepotentiated) predisposition to abruptly increase vagal tone and collapse flaccidly rather than freeze or attempt to flee or fight in response to an approaching sharp object, a minor injury, or the sight of blood, may have evolved as an alternative stress-induced fear-circuitry response. Such a stable (balanced) polymorphism for the hemodynamically paradoxical flaccid-immobility in response to these stimuli may have increased some non-combatants' chances of survival. This is consistent with the unusual age and sex pattern of fear-induced fainting. The Paleolithic-Threat hypothesis also predicts a link to various hypo-androgenic states (e.g. low dehydroxyepiandrosterone-sulfate. We offer five predictions testable via epidemiological, clinical, and ethological/primatological methods. The Paleolithic-Threat hypothesis has implications for research in the aftermath of man-made disasters, such as terrorism against civilians, a traumatic event in which this hypothesis predicts epidemics of fear-induced fainting.","Pacific Isl Hlth Care Syst, Dept Vet Affairs, Natl Ctr Posttraumat Stree Disorder, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; Univ Hawaii, Dept Psychol, Honolulu, HI USA",,"Bracha, HS (corresponding author), Pacific Isl Hlth Care Syst, Dept Vet Affairs, Natl Ctr Posttraumat Stree Disorder, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.",H.Bracha@med.va.gov,,,,,,20,21,21,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0959-9851,1619-1560,,CLIN AUTON RES,Clin.

In this review, we discuss the current understandings of the subjective experience of fear and the related biological processes involved in fear learning and memory. We first provide an overview of fear learning and memory in humans and animal models, encompassing the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms, the influence of genetic and environmental factors, and how fear learning paradigms have contributed to treatments for fear-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Current treatments as well as novel strategies, such as targeting the perisynaptic environment and use of virtual reality, are addressed. We review research on the subjective experience of fear and the role of autobiographical memory in fear-related disorders. We also discuss the gaps in our understanding of fear learning and memory, and the degree of consensus in the field. Lastly, the development of linguistic tools for assessments and treatment of fear learning and memory disorders is discussed.","[Raber, Jacob; Boutros, Sydney Weber] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, ONPRC, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Raber, Jacob] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Neurol, ONPRC, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Raber, Jacob] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Radiat Med, ONPRC, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Raber, Jacob] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Neurosci, ONPRC, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Arzy, Shahar] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Med Neurobiol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Boulanger-Bertolus, Julie; Mouly, Anne-Marie] Univ Lyon, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, CNRS UMR 5292, INSERM U1028, Lyon, France; [Depue, Brendan] Univ Louisville, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Depue, Brendan] Univ Louisville, Dept Anat Sci & Neurobiol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Haas, Haley E.; Norrholm, Seth Davin; Weingast, Leah.

It is, however, unknown whether the BLA acts in similar ways in humans. In a group of five subjects with a rare genetic syndrome, that is, Urbach-Wiethe disease (UWD), we used a combination of structural and functional neuroimaging, and established focal, bilateral BLA damage, while other amygdala sub-regions are functionally intact. We tested the translational hypothesis that these BLA-damaged UWD-subjects are hypervigilant to facial expressions of fear, which are prototypical innate threat cues in humans. Our data indeed repeatedly confirm fear hypervigilance in these UWD subjects. They show hypervigilant responses to unconsciously presented fearful faces in a modified Stroop task. They attend longer to the eyes of dynamically displayed fearful faces in an eye-tracked emotion recognition task, and in that task recognize facial fear significantly better than control subjects. These findings provide the first direct evidence in humans in support of an inhibitory function of the BLA on the brain's threat vigilance system, which has important implications for the understanding of the amygdala's role in the disorders of fear and anxiety.

In animals, it is well documented that the endogenous cannabinoid system has a pivotal role in the successful extinction of fear, most importantly through the cannabinoid receptor 1. However, no human studies have reported a translation of this preclinical evidence yet. Healthy medication-free human subjects (N = 150) underwent a fear conditioning and extinction procedure in a virtual reality environment. Fear potentiation of the eyeblink startle reflex was measured to assess fear-conditioned responding, and subjective fear ratings were collected. Participants were genotyped for two polymorphisms located within the promoter region (rs2180619) and the coding region (rs1049353) of cannabinoid receptor 1. As predicted from the preclinical literature, acquisition and expression of conditioned fear did not differ between genotypes. Crucially, whereas both homozygote (G/G, N = 23) and heterozygote (A/G, N = 68) G-allele carriers of rs2180619 displayed robust extinction of fear, extinction of fear-potentiated startle was absent in A/A homozygotes (N = 51). Additionally, this resistance to extinguish fear left A/A carriers of rs2180619 with significantly higher levels of fear-potentiated startle at the end of the extinction training. No effects of rs1049353 genotype were observed regarding fear acquisition and extinction. These results suggest for the first time involvement of the human endocannabinoid system in fear extinction. Implications are that genetic variability in this system may underlie individual differences in anxiety, rendering cannabinoid receptor 1 a potential target for novel pharmacological treatments of anxiety disorders.

In addition to these overt changes to animals' behavior, observers may have more subtle impacts on animals' foraging decisions. However, the anthropogenic alteration of risk-taking behavior has rarely been acknowledged or quantified, particularly in behavioral ecological studies reliant on habituated animals. We tested the magnitude of the human shield effect experimentally on 2 groups of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarcus, at a site with high natural predator density and no human hunting pressure. In general, giving-up densities-the density of food remaining in a patch when a forager leaves-were greatest at ground level (0.1 m) relative to 3 tree canopy levels (2.5, 5, and 7.5 m), highlighting a strong vertical axis of fear. When human followers were present, however, giving-up densities were reduced at all 4 heights; furthermore, for 1 group, the vertical axis disappeared in the presence of observers.

Yet energetic constraints on movement imposed by the physical landscape have only been considered separately from those imposed by risk avoidance, limiting our understanding of how short-term movement decisions scale up to affect long-term space use. Here, we integrate the costs of both physical terrain and predation risk into a common currency, energy, and then quantify their effects on the short-term movement and long-term spatial ecology of a large carnivore living in a human-dominated landscape. Using high-resolution GPS and accelerometer data from collared pumas (Puma concolor), we calculated the short-term (i.e., 5-min) energetic costs of navigating both rugged physical terrain and a landscape of risk from humans (major sources of both mortality and fear for our study population). Both the physical and risk landscapes affected puma short-term movement costs, with risk having a relatively greater impact by inducing high-energy but low-efficiency movement behavior. The cumulative effects of short-term movement costs led to reductions of 29% to 68% in daily travel distances and total home range area. For male pumas, long-term patterns of space use were predominantly driven by the energetic costs of human-induced risk. This work demonstrates that, along with physical terrain, predation risk plays a primary role in shaping an animal's energy landscape and suggests that fear of humans may be a major factor affecting wildlife movements worldwide.","[Nickel, Barry A.; Suraci, Justin P.; Nisi, Anna C.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Nickel, BA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",bnickel@ucsc.edu,,"Nisi, Anna/0000-0003-0286-3187","Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1255913, 0963022]","We thank P.

Included studies (K = 6, N = 176) reported whole-brain fMRI results and applied generalization-gradient methodology to identify brain activations that gradually strengthen (positive generalization) or weaken (negative generalization) as presented stimuli increase in CS+ resemblance. Positive generalization was instantiated in cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, striatalthalamic, and midbrain regions (locus coeruleus, periaqueductal grey, ventral tegmental area), while negative generalization was implemented in default-mode network nodes (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus) and amygdala.

The responses of vascular resistance (VR) during fear-induced stress was studied by measuring the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), skin blood flow in the index finger and forehead, limb blood flow in the calf and forearm, and blood flow in the renal and superior mesenteric arteries before, during, and after a period of induced fear. After 2 min of rest, baseline data were acquired from eight subjects, after which they watched a 3-min video that was considered to be frightening. Minute-by-minute data were calculated. The MAP was divided by the blood flow to attain the VR. While a clear steady state was not evident in the stress-induced vascular response, stress significantly increased the MAP and HR (e.g., by 10 +/- 3 mm Hg and 8 +/- 3 bpm, respectively, at the 2nd min; mean +/- SEM), and the VR of the forearm and finger skin (e.g., by 80 +/- 26% and 79 +/- 28%, respectively, at the 2nd min). The VR increased slightly in the calf and visceral arteries but not in the forehead throughout the stimulation. The variables returned to baseline levels by the 1st min after cessation of the fearful stimulation. These results suggest that fear-induced stress causes vasoconstriction in the forearm and finger.

Yet, seldom are parents observed across multiple reproductive bouts, with few studies considering anthropogenic disturbances as an ecological driver of maternal effects. We observed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs over two successive litters to determine whether among-litter differences in behavior (i.e., risk-taking) and hormones (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) corresponded with parental plasticity in habituation. Thus, we explicitly test the hypothesis that accumulating experiences of anthropogenic disturbance reduces parental fear across reproductive bouts, which should have disparate phenotypic consequences for first- and second-litter offspring. To quantify risk-taking behavior, we used foraging assays from 5-15 weeks of age with a human observer present as a proxy for human disturbance. At 5, 10, and 15 weeks of age, we collected shaved hair to quantify pup hormone levels. We then used a quantitative genetic approach to estimate heritability, repeatability, and between-trait correlations. We found that parents were riskier (i.e., foraged more frequently) with their second versus first litters, supporting our prediction that parents become increasingly habituated over time. Second-litter pups were also less risk-averse than their first-litter siblings. Heritability for all traits did not differ from zero (0.001-0.018); however, we found moderate support for repeatability in all observed traits (r = 0.085-0.421). Lastly, we found evidence of positive phenotypic and cohort correlations among pup traits, implying that cohort identity (i.e., common environment) contributes to the development of phenotypic syndromes in coyote pups. Our results suggest that parental habituation may be an ecological cue for offspring to reduce their fear response, thus emphasizing the role of parental plasticity in shaping their pups' behavioral and hormonal responses toward humans.","[Schell, Christopher J.; Santymire, Rachel M.; Mateo, Jill M.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schell, Christopher J.] Univ Washington, Sch Interdisciplinary Arts & Sci, Tacoma, WA USA; [Young, Julie K.] Utah State Univ, USDA WS NWRC, Predator Res Facil, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Lonsdorf, Elizabeth V.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Psychol, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Santymire, Rachel M.] Lincoln Pk Zoo, Conservat & Sci Dept, Chicago, IL USA",,"Schell, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cjschell@uw.edu,"; Schell, Christopher/Q-9654-2017","Lonsdorf, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8057-401X; Schell, Christopher/0000-0002-2073-9852; Santymire, Rachel/0000-0003-4102-9144",Pritzker School of Medicine (Hinds Fellowship); Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (NWRC Predator Research Facility Fellowship); United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corporation (MERCK Fellowship); MerckMerck & Company; U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [72184]; University of ChicagoUniversity of Chicago; Directorate for Biological Sciences (NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)),"Pritzker School of Medicine, Grant/Award Number: Hinds Fellowship (2011, 2013); Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Grant/Award Number: NWRC Predator Research Facility Fellowship; United Negro College Fund Special Programs Corporation, Grant/Award Number: MERCK Fellowship; Directorate for Biological Sciences, Grant/Award Number: NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP); Merck; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: 72184; University of Chicago",,156,21,21,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

It has been studied primarily using fear conditioning in non-human animals, thwarting advances in translational human anxiety research that has used other indices, such as skin conductance responses. Here we examine postural freezing as a human conditioning index for translational anxiety research. We employed a mixed cued/contextual fear-conditioning paradigm where one context signals the occurrence of the US upon the presentation of the CS, and another context signals that the CS is not followed by the US. Critically, during the following generalization phase, the CS is presented in a third and novel context. We show that human freezing is highly sensitive to fear conditioning, generalizes to ambiguous contexts, and amplifies with threat imminence. Intriguingly, stronger parasympathetically driven freezing under threat, but not sympathetically mediated skin conductance, predicts subsequent startle magnitude. These results demonstrate that humans show fear-conditioned animal-like freezing responses, known to aid in active preparation for unexpected attack, and that freezing captures real-life anxiety expression. Conditioned freezing offers a promising new, non-invasive, and continuous, readout for human fear conditioning, paving the way for future translational studies into human fear and anxiety.","[van Ast, Vanessa A.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Ast, Vanessa A.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Ast, Vanessa A.; Klumpers, Floris; Roelofs, Karin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Klumpers, Floris; Roelofs, Karin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Grasman, Raoul P.

Large predators and mesopredators usually produce this fear in animals. This effect is recognised in the form of various behavioural changes and adaptations, which, in turn, affects the whole ecosystem. However, we often overlook the role of large predators and mesopredators in the sustenance of our ecosystem by such non-lethal effects, because fear is often seen as a psychological effect rather than something that can be found through explicit scientific means. Indeed, the fear that predators trigger inside their prey may play a significant role in the maintenance of the natural environment. This paper aims to analyse this hypothesis by reviewing the function of the ecology of fear based on the interaction among predators, prey, and mesopredators. We consider the factors involved in the effective functionality of the ecology of fear, including habitat landscape, season, weather, and predation risk. We also assess the extent of influence of large predators on behaviour and distribution of prey and mesopredators in terms of predation cues and prey grouping as responses to predation risk. Finally, we discuss the implications of fear ecology for wildlife conservation and management and new challenges.","[Mpemba, H.; Yang, F.; Jiang, G.] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, G (corresponding author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife & Protected Areas, Feline Res Ctr Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",jgshun@126.com,,"Jiang, Guangshun/0000-0001-6321-9489","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2572017PZ14]; National Key Programme of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0503200]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC 31872241, 31572285]","We thank our colleagues in the Feline Research Center of National Foretry and Grassland Administration, College of Wildlife and Protected Areas, Northeast Forestry University for their appreciated suggestions during the preparation of this work.

Despite recent conceptual advances and potential management implications of the ecology of fear, theory and conservation practices have rarely been linked. Many challenges in animal conservation may be alleviated by actively harnessing or compensating for risk perception and risk avoidance behavior in wild animal populations. Integration of the ecology of fear into conservation and management practice can contribute to the recovery of threatened populations, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, invasive species management, maintenance of sustainable harvest and species reintroduction plans. Here, we present an applied framework that links conservation interventions to desired outcomes by manipulating ecology of fear dynamics. We discuss how to reduce or amplify fear in wild animals by manipulating habitat structure, sensory stimuli, animal experience (previous exposure to risk) and food safety trade-offs to achieve management objectives. Changing the optimal decision-making of individuals in managed populations can then further conservation goals by shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of animals, changing predation rates and altering risk effects that scale up to demographic consequences. We also outline future directions for applied research on fear ecology that will better inform conservation practices. Our framework can help scientists and practitioners anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences of management decisions, and highlight new levers for multi-species conservation strategies that promote human-wildlife coexistence.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX USA; [Gilbert, Sophie L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Kohl, Michel T.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Larson, Courtney L.] Nature Conservancy, Lander, WY USA; [Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Young, Julie K.] USDA, Predator Res Facil, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Millville, UT USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Newsome, Thomas M/ABE-8451-2021; Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Newsome, Thomas M/0000-0003-3457-3256; Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061; Gilbert, Sophie/0000-0002-9974-5146; Kohl, Michel/0000-0001-8218-1455; Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",Wildlife Society Damage Control Working Group; Schmidt Science Fellows program; Rhodes Trust; USDA -National Wildlife Research CenterUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"This study arose from an organized symposium at The Wildlife Society's 2018 conference in Cleveland, Ohio, When does fear matter in wildlife management?

Thus, the aim of the present study was to address this question. Body odour samples were collected from 16 two-year-old thoroughbred horses in fear and non-fear situations, respectively. The horse odour samples were then assessed by 73 human odour raters. We found that humans, as a group, were able to correctly assign whether horse odour samples were collected under a fear- or a non-fear condition, respectively. An open question remains, which is whether humans could simply distinguish between little versus much sweat and between high intensity versus low intensity or were able to recognise horses' fear and non-fear emotions. To conclude, the present results indicate that olfaction might contribute to the human recognition of horse emotions. However, these results should be addressed with caution in light of the study's limitations and only viewed as exploratory for future studies. Mammalian body odour conveys cues about an individual's emotional state that can be recognised by conspecifics. Thus far, little attention has been paid to interspecific odour communication of emotions, and no studies have examined whether humans are able to recognise animal emotions from body odour. Thus, the aim of the present study was to address this question. Body odour samples were collected from 16 two-year-old thoroughbred horses in fear and non-fear situations, respectively. The horse odour samples were then assessed by 73 human odour raters. We found that humans, as a group, were able to correctly assign whether horse odour samples were collected under a fear- or a non-fear condition, respectively. Furthermore, they perceived the body odour of horses collected under the fear condition as more intense, compared with the non-fear condition. An open question remains, which is whether humans could simply distinguish between little versus much sweat and between high intensity versus low intensity or were able to recognise horses' fear and non-fear emotions. These results appear to fit the notion that the ability to recognise emotions in other species may present an advantage to both the sender and the receiver of emotional cues, particularly in the interaction between humans and domesticated animals. To conclude, the present results indicate that olfaction might contribute to the human recognition of horse emotions.

On day 1 - the fear acquisition phase, healthy participants are exposed to a series of picture presentations. One picture stimulus (CS1+) is repeatedly paired with an aversive electric stimulus (US), resulting in the acquisition of a fear association, whereas another picture stimulus (CS2-) is never followed by an US. On day 2 - the memory reactivation phase, the participants are re-exposed to the conditioned stimulus without the US (CS1-), which typically triggers a conditioned fear response. After the memory reactivation we administer an oral dose of 40 mg of propranolol HCl, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that indirectly targets the protein synthesis required for reconsolidation by inhibiting the noradrenaline-stimulated CREB phosphorylation. On day 3 - the test phase, the participants are again exposed to the unreinforced conditioned stimuli (CS1- and CS2-) in order to measure the fear-reducing effect of the manipulation. This retention test is followed by an extinction procedure and the presentation of situational triggers to test for the return of fear. Potentiation of the eye blink startle reflex is measured as an index for conditioned fear responding. Declarative knowledge of the fear association is measured through online US expectancy ratings during each CS presentation. In contrast to extinction learning, disrupting reconsolidation targets the original fear memory thereby preventing the return of fear. Although the clinical applications are still in their infancy, disrupting reconsolidation of fear memory seems to be a promising new technique with the prospect to persistently dampen the expression of fear memory in patients suffering from anxiety disorders and other psychiatric disorders.","[Kindt, Merel; Soeter, Marieke; Sevenster, Dieuwke] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Kindt, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",M.Kindt@uva.nl,,,VICI grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research,This work is supported by a VICI grant (Merel Kindt) from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.,,63,17,18,0,17,JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,CAMBRIDGE,"1 ALEWIFE CENTER, STE 200, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02140 USA",1940-087X,,,JOVE-J VIS EXP,J.

However, it is also important to flexibly readjust fear behavior when circumstances change. Indeed, a failure to adjust to changing conditions may contribute to anxiety disorders. A central, yet neglected aspect of fear modulation is the ability to flexibly shift fear responses from one stimulus to another if a once-threatening stimulus becomes safe or a once-safe stimulus becomes threatening. In these situations, the inhibition of fear and the development of fear reactions co-occur but are directed at different targets, requiring accurate responding under continuous stress. To date, research on fear modulation has focused mainly on the shift from fear to safety by using paradigms such as extinction, resulting in a reduction of fear. The aim of the present study was to track the dynamic shifts from fear to safety and from safety to fear when these transitions occur simultaneously. We used functional neuroimaging in conjunction with a fear-conditioning reversal paradigm. Our results reveal a unique dissociation within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex between a safe stimulus that previously predicted danger and a naive safe stimulus. We show that amygdala and striatal responses tracked the fear-predictive stimuli, flexibly flipping their responses from one predictive stimulus to another. Moreover, prediction errors associated with reversal learning correlated with striatal activation. These results elucidate how fear is readjusted to appropriately track environmental changes, and the brain mechanisms underlying the flexible control of fear.","[Schiller, Daniela; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Schiller, Daniela; Levy, Ifat; LeDoux, Joseph E.; Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Niv, Yael] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Niv, Yael] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Phelps, EA (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl,Room 863, New York, NY 10003 USA.",liz.phelps@nyu.edu,"Schiller, Daniela/Q-2431-2018","Schiller, Daniela/0000-0002-0357-7724; Levy, Ifat/0000-0001-7851-9070","Seaver Foundation; National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 K05 MH067048, P50 MH58911, R21 MH072279]; James S.

It has been proposed that memory labilization allows for the integration of relevant information in the established memory trace (memory updating). Memory labilization and reconsolidation do not necessarily occur when a memory is being reactivated, but only when there is something to be learned during memory retrieval (prediction error). Thus, updating of a fear memory trace should not occur under retrieval conditions in which the outcome is fully predictable (no prediction error). Here, we addressed this issue, using a human differential fear conditioning procedure, by eliminating the very possibility of reinforcement of the reminder cue. A previously established fear memory (picture-shock pairings) was reactivated with shock-electrodes attached (Propranolol group, n = 18) or unattached (Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group, n = 19). We additionally tested a placebo-control group with the shock-electrodes attached (Placebo group, n = 18). Reconsolidation was not triggered when nothing could be learned during the reminder trial, as noradrenergic blockade did not affect expression of the fear memory 24 h later in the Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group. Only when the outcome of the retrieval cue was not fully predictable, propranolol, contrary to placebo, reduced the startle fear response and prevented the return of fear (reinstatement) the following day. In line with previous studies, skin conductance response and shock expectancies were not affected by propranolol. Remarkably, a double dissociation emerged between the emotional (startle response) and more cognitive expression (expectancies, SCR) of the fear memory. Our findings have important implications for reconsolidation blockade as treatment strategy for emotional disorders. First, fear reducing procedures that target the emotional component of fear memory do not necessarily affect the cognitive component and vice versa. Second, mere retrieval of the fear memory is not sufficient to induce its labilization and reconsolidation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

PTSD is a fear-based disorder, characterized by difficulties in extinguishing the learned fear response and maintaining extinction. Currently, the first-line treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy, which forms an extinction memory to compete with the original fear memory. However, the extinguished fear often returns under numerous circumstances, suggesting that novel methods are needed to eliminate fear memory or facilitate extinction memory. This review discusses research that targeted extinction and reconsolidation to manipulate fear memory. Recent studies indicate that sleep is an active state that can regulate memory processes. We also discuss the influence of sleep on fear memory. For each manipulation, we briefly summarize the neural mechanisms that have been identified in human studies. Finally, we highlight potential limitations and future directions in the field to better translate existing interventions to clinical settings.","[Yue, Jingli; Shi, Le; Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Hosp 6, Inst Mental Hlth,Key Mental Hlth,Minist Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Shi, Le; Khan, Muhammad Zahid; Shi, Jie; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",,"Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Hosp 6, Inst Mental Hlth,Key Mental Hlth,Minist Hlth, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,,,National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2015BAI13B01],This work was supported by the National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2015BAI13B01).,,86,2,4,2,18,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7305,1869-1889,,SCI CHINA LIFE SCI,Sci.

Overgeneralization, however, is maladaptive and has been implicated in a number of anxiety disorders. Neuroimaging research has indicated several regions sensitive to effects of gener-alization, including regions involved in fear excitation (e.g., amygdala, insula) and inhibition (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Research has suggested several other small brain regions may play an important role in this process (e.g., hippocampal subfields, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [BNST], habenula), but, to date, these regions have not been examined during fear generalization due to limited spatial resolution of standard human neuroimaging. To this end, we utilized the high spatial resolution of 7T fMRI to characterize the neural circuits involved in threat discrimination and generalization. Additionally, we examined potential modulating effects of trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty on neural activation during threat generalization. In a sample of 31 healthy undergraduate students, significant positive generalization effects (i.e., greater activation for stim-uli with increasing perceptual similarity to a learned threat cue) were observed in the visual cortex, thalamus, habenula and BNST, while negative generalization effects were observed in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3. Associations with individual differences were underpowered, though preliminary findings suggested greater gen-eralization in the insula and primary somatosensory cortex may be correlated with self-reported anxiety. Overall, findings largely support previous neuroimaging work on fear generalization and provide additional insight into the contributions of several previously unexplored brain regions.","[Huggins, Ashley A.; Weis, Carissa N.; Parisi, Elizabeth A.; Larson, Christine L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 2441 E Hartford Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Bennett, Kenneth P.] Montana VA Healthcare Syst, Helena, MT USA; [Miskovic, Vladimir] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Psychol, Binghamton, NY USA; [Huggins, Ashley A.] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Psychiat, Charleston, SC 29425 USA",,"Larson, CL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 2441 E Hartford Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",huggins@uwm.edu; cnweis@uwm.edu; eaparisi@uwm.edu; benne257@uwm.edu; larsoncl@uwm.edu,,,,,,151,0,0,11,15,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1053-8119,1095-9572,,NEUROIMAGE,Neuroimage,OCT 1,2021,239,,,,,,,,118308,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118308,,JUL 2021,16,"Neurosciences; Neuroimaging; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",TU8NS,WOS:000681288300001,34175426,gold,,,2022-03-23,

Objective: The four studies presented in this report sought to further validate the threat of shock paradigm as a human analogue to fear-potentiated startle in rats, by examining the effect of benzodiazepine administration on both baseline and fear-potentiated startle. Methods: Three studies, conducted at Utrecht University, evaluated the effects of oxazepam and of diazepam on baseline and fear-potentiated startle, whereas a fourth study, conducted at Yale University, evaluated the effect of diazepam on baseline, contextual and cuespecific fear-potentiated startle. The threat of shock paradigm consisted of verbal instruction about two visual cues (the threat cue predicted the possible administration of electric shock, the other predicted a safe period), followed by a series of presentations of these cues. During these conditions, acoustic startle stimuli were presented in order to elicit startle responses. The magnitude of the startle response was used to index the degree of fear or alarm experienced during the periods of threat and safety. The fourth study examined the effect of IV administration of diazepam in a similar threat of shock paradigm except that there were two additional context manipulations: electrode placement and darkness. Results: None of the drug manipulations affected specific threat-cue potentiation of startle. However, reductions in baseline startle were observed. Further, startle potentiation by darkness was inhibited by diazepam. Conclusions: At least one type of fear-potentiated startle, i.e. potentiation by a cue-specific fear manipulation, is not susceptible to benzodiazepine treatment. In contrast, effects of manipulations more akin to anxiety (darkness, context) appear sensitive to benzodiazepines. Human experimental models differentiating between these cue specific and contextual responses are needed to shed more light on differences in the anatomy and pharmacology of anxiety disorders.","Univ Utrecht, Fac Pharm, Dept Psychopharmacol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands; NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Med, Connecticut VA Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat, West Haven, CT 06516 USA",,"Baas, JMP (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, 15K N Dr MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",,,"Baas, Johanna/0000-0001-6267-8712","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798, Z01MH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,46,96,96,0,13,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,MAY,2002,161,3,,,,,233,247,,10.1007/s00213-002-1011-8,,,15,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,562JG,WOS:000176193200003,12021826,,,,2022-03-23,

Hare, 1963; Watts and Sharrock, 1984). The goals of the present study were twofold: to replicate the effect of a fear cue on time estimation, and to evaluate the mechanism underlying the effect. Seven stimulus durations in two different duration ranges (short: 250-1000 ms; long: 400-1600 ms) were employed in the bisection procedure. Adult human participants were exposed to two successive sessions, one each with the short and long range. Images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2008) that were rated on three scales including arousal and fear were presented as temporal stimuli. Three images that were rated high on fear and three rated low served as fear cues and neutral control images, respectively. Results indicated that for both ranges, judgments were longer for fear cues than for neutral images, and that the magnitude of the effect did not differ between ranges as measured by the bisection point. Application of scalar expectancy theory (SET; Gibbon. 1977; Church, 1984) to these results suggests that the fear effects were mediated by switch latency of an internal clock, rather than by clock speed.

The present study examined the effects of experimentally induced fear and anxiety on radiant heat pain thresholds. Sixty male and female human subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 emotion induction conditions: (1) fear, induced by exposure to three brief shocks; (2) anxiety, elicited by the threat of shock; (3) neutral, with no intervention. Pain thresholds were tested before and after emotion induction. Results suggest that findings from animal studies extend to humans: fear resulted in decreased pain reactivity, while anxiety led to increased reactivity. Pain rating data indicated that participants used consistent subjective criteria to indicate pain thresholds. Both subjective and physiological indicators (skin conductance level, heart rate) confirmed that the treatment conditions produced the targeted emotional states. These results support the view that emotional states modulate human pain reactivity. (C) 2000 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Prior studies have found that reducing fear generalization using a generalization stimulus (GS) is ineffective in removing a conditioned fear that incorporates local features, and that topological properties appear to play a comparatively more significant role in the processes of perception and categorization. Our study utilized a conditioned-fear generalization design to examine whether the topological properties of stimuli influence the generalization and return of fear. Fear was indexed using online expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses (SCRs). The study's 52 participants were divided into three groups: Group 1, conditioned danger cue (CS+) extinction; Group 2, extinction of one GS; Group 3, extinction of three GSs. We found that the three groups acquired conditioned fear at the same level. In the generalization and extinction phase, fear was transferred to the GS with the same topological properties as CS+, and gradual decreases in both shock expectancy and SCRs over non-reinforced extinction trials were observed. In the test phase, participants' online expectancy ratings indicated that fear did not return in Group 1, but did return in Groups 2 and 3. All three groups demonstrated successful GS fear extinction, but only Group 1 did not show a return of fear for CS+. Regarding SCRs results, none of the groups demonstrated a return of fear, suggesting that utilization of topological properties successfully reduced the return of conditioned fear. Our results indicate that, in clinical settings, using GS with topological equivalence to CS+ might offer a potential method with which to extinct conditioned fear.","[Xu, Liang; Su, Hongyu; Xie, Xiaoyuan; Yan, Pei; Li, Junjiao; Zheng, Xifu] South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liang] Guangdong Commun Polytech, Dept Human & Social Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Su, Hongyu; Xie, Xiaoyuan; Yan, Pei; Li, Junjiao; Zheng, Xifu] South China Normal Univ, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Su, Hongyu; Xie, Xiaoyuan; Yan, Pei; Li, Junjiao; Zheng, Xifu] South China Normal Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Mental Hlth & Cognit Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Zheng, XF (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Zheng, XF (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Zheng, XF (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Mental Hlth & Cognit Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xifu.zheng.xz@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31771218]; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDB259]; Guangzhou government,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771218), the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (14ZDB259), and psychological services and counseling base for the Happy Guangzhou project, which received funding from the Guangzhou government.",,53,2,3,3,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

This article evaluated the potential effect of exposure to bears and their habitats on human fear of brown bears using the modeling of appropriate behavior when close to bears. In a within-subject design, 25 persons who reported to be fearful of brown bears participated in a guided walk approaching approximately 50 m of a brown bear in its daybed and in a guided forest walk in bear habitat. The presentation order was reversed for half of the group. The participants reported significantly reduced feelings of fear after the bear walk, but not after the forest walk. There were no corresponding significant effects for the experimental measures of fear-related responses. The results partially support the notion that exposure to the object of fear, such as a bear habitat with presence of a bear, might be a feasible intervention to reduce peoples' feeling of fear, but the design of the intervention must be developed further before it can be used in practice.","[Johansson, Maria] Lund Univ, Environm Psychol, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Stoen, Ole-Gunnar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resources Management, As, Norway; [Flykt, Anders] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Psychol, Ostersund, Sweden",,"Johansson, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Environm Psychol, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",maria.johansson@mpe.lth.se,"Støen, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020",,Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway,"This research was funded by research grants from the Norwegian Environment Agency.

To map this 'landscape of fear', prey use evolutionary rules of thumbs that are associated with the activity and hunting efficiency of predators. In addition, prey acquire perceptual information about the presence, identity and state of potential predators and use these cues to focus their acute anti-predatory responses. Our goal was to explore if and how prey also use such perceptual information that decays with time to update their spatiotemporal risk assessment. We placed scorpions in freshly dug burrows and recorded the spatial activity and defense behavior of their isopod prey upon encountering the burrows straight after settling the scorpions and seven days later. To corroborate our understanding, we also examined the isopods' detailed reactions towards deserted scorpion burrows. The isopods reacted defensively to scorpion burrows during their first encounter. After seven days, proportionally more isopods approached the scorpion burrows on their way out for foraging and fewer isopods encountered it on their way back. No changes in the spatial activity were observed towards deserted burrows. In addition, on the eighth day, more isopods entered the risky area near the scorpion burrows when leaving their own burrow than on the first encounter. The results suggest that isopods used predator cues to readjust the 'landscape of fear'. Yet, rather than avoiding the dangerous areas altogether, the isopods implemented risky inspection behavior, validating whether the danger is actual. Our findings imply that inspection behavior toward predators can be used for future planning of prey spatial activity, offsetting possible 'information decay costs'.","[Zaguri, Moshe; Hawlena, Dror] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Risk Management Ecol Lab, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus Givat Ram, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Zaguri, M (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Risk Management Ecol Lab, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Edmond J Safra Campus Givat Ram, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",moshe.zaguri@mail.huji.ac.il,,,,,,54,4,4,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2019,128,10,,,,,1458,1466,,10.1111/oik.06477,,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JH0EI,WOS:000492447100008,,hybrid,,,2022-03-23,

In part two of the experiment, the axillary pads were presented to female subjects in a triple forced choice test. Results show that subjects were able to discriminate between fear and non-fear axillary pads, suggesting that women are indeed able to detect the scent of fear.

A functional, anatomical model of defense behavior in animals is presented and applications are described in cognitive and physiological studies of human affect. It is proposed that unpleasant emotions depend on the activation of an evolutionarily primitive subcortical circuit, including the amygdala and the neural structures to which it projects. This motivational system mediates specific autonomic (e.g., heart rate change) and somatic reflexes (e.g., startle change) that originally promoted survival in dangerous conditions. These same response patterns are illustrated in humans, as they process objective, memorial, and media stimuli. Furthermore, it is shown how variations in the neural circuit and its outputs may separately characterize cue-specific fear las in specific phobia) and more generalized anxiety. Finally, again emphasizing links between the animal and human data, we focus on special, attentional features of emotional processing: The automaticity of fear reactions, hyper-reactivity to minimal threat-cues, and evidence that the physiological responses in fear may be independent of slower, language-based appraisal processes.

It has been suggested that an opioidergic signal, which is engaged through conditioning and acts inhibitory on unconditioned stimulus input, is the source of these effects. To clarify whether blockade of endogenous opioid neurotransmission enhances acquisition of conditioned fear in humans, and to elucidate the neural underpinnings of such an effect, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with behavioral recordings and a double-blind pharmacological intervention. All subjects underwent the same classical fear-conditioning paradigm, but subjects in the experimental group received the opioid antagonist naloxone before and during the experiment, in contrast to subjects in the control group, who received saline. Blocking endogenous opioid neurotransmission with naloxone led to more sustained responses to the unconditioned stimulus across trials, evident in both behavioral and blood oxygen level-dependent responses in pain responsive cortical regions. This effect was likely caused by naloxone blocking conditioned responses in a pain-inhibitory circuit involving opioid-rich areas such as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Most importantly, naloxone enhanced the acquisition of fear on the behavioral level and changed the activation profile of the amygdala: whereas the control group showed rapidly decaying conditioned responses across trials, the naloxone group showed sustained conditioned responses in the amygdala. Together, these results demonstrate that in humans the endogenous opioid system has an inhibitory role in the acquisition of fear.","[Eippert, Falk; Schoell, Eszter; Yacubian, Juliana; Buechel, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Bingel, Ulrike] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Neurol, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany",,"Eippert, F (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",f.eippert@uke.uni-hamburg.de,"Eippert, Falk/M-6188-2013","Schoell, Eszter D./0000-0001-9817-521X; Eippert, Falk/0000-0002-3986-1719",,,,62,67,67,1,5,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,1529-2401,,J NEUROSCI,J.

Mean position, Mean Power Frequency (MPF) and Root Mean Square (RMS) of centre of pressure (COP) displacements were calculated from 60 s standing trials, and psychosocial and physiological measures of fear and anxiety were also collected. When standing at a height of 3.2 m, 10 of 36 participants reported an increase in anxiety and a robust fear response while the remaining 26 participants experienced only an increase in anxiety and no fear response. A between subjects analysis of the effect Of Surface height on postural control revealed that fearful and non-fearful participants adopted different postural control strategies with increased heights. Non-fearful participants demonstrated a postural response characterized by increased MPF and decreased RMS of COP displacements with increasing heights. In contrast, fearful participants demonstrated both increasing MPF and RMS of COP displacements with increasing heights.

These results indicate that unpredictable shocks lead to greater context conditioning as measured by startle and self-reports.","Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), 9000 Rockville Pike,Bldg 10,Room 3N212,MSC 1279, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",christian.grillon@nih.gov,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R29MH050720, Z01MH002798, R01MH053618, ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R29 MH50720, R01 MH53618-01A2] Funding Source: Medline",,,40,46,46,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,MAY,2001,38,3,,,,,383,390,,10.1111/1469-8986.3830383,,,8,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,430PU,WOS:000168584400003,11352126,,,,2022-03-23,

This may help to explain that the ability of detecting a danger or threat has been highly conserved throughout evolution, and, thus involves a high degree of homologies across species. Studies in laboratory animals thereby enable to identify key neurochemical, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fear and anxiety, and importantly, to also draw conclusions on the mechanistics in human beings. This, in turn, provides a most valuable basis of fostering improvements in prognosis, diagnosis, prevention and therapies of anxiety disorders. The present article focuses on one aspect that is central to translational anxiety research, namely the neuronal substrates and circuits of fear memory and fear extinction. Following a brief introduction to the principles of fear conditioning, synaptic circuits will be described underlying the acquisition and extinction of fear memory in the mammalian brain. Historically established principles will be systematically compared with novel findings on the detailed synaptic circuit organization of the fear matrix. The knowledge of the neuronal substrates and connectivities will significantly improve our understanding of pathologically transformed states of fear and anxiety, and thereby help to derive novel intervention strategies for the treatment of anxiety disorders.","[Wotjak, Carsten T.] LMU Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Pape, Hans-Christian] Otto von Guericke Univ, Inst Physiol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Pape, Hans-Christian] Westfal Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Physiol Neurophysiol 1, Munster, Germany",,"Wotjak, CT (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Psychiat AG Neuronale Plastizitat, Kraepelinstr 2-10, D-80804 Munich, Germany.",wotjak@mpipsykl.mpg.de; hans-christian.pape@ukmuenster.de,"Wotjak, Carsten T./S-3200-2019",,,,,13,6,6,4,26,SPEKTRUM AKADEMISCHER VERLAG-SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH,HEILDEBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, HEILDEBERG, 69121, GERMANY",0947-0875,,,NEUROFORUM,Neuroforum,SEP,2013,19,3,,,,,92,102,,,,,11,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,211AY,WOS:000323877700002,,,,,2022-03-23,

In this paradigm, the amygdala is known to play a critical role. However, classical fear conditioning requires first-hand experience with an aversive event, which may not be how most fears are acquired in humans. It remains to be determined whether the conditioning model can be extended to indirect forms of learning more common in humans. Here we show that fear acquired indirectly through social observation, with no personal experience of the aversive event, engages similar neural mechanisms as fear conditioning. The amygdala was recruited both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in an analogous situation. These findings confirm the central role of the amygdala in the acquisition and expression of observational fear learning, and validate the extension of cross-species models of fear conditioning to learning in a human sociocultural context. Our findings also provides new insights into the relationship between learning from, and empathizing with, fearful others. This study suggests that indirectly attained fears may be as powerful as fears originating from direct experiences.","[Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Phelps, Elizabeth A.] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nearing, Katherine I.] NYU, Sch Med, Epilepsy Ctr, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Olsson, Andreas] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Phelps, EA (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl Meyer Hall, New York, NY 10003 USA.",liz.phelps@nyu.edu,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH62104, R01 MH062104] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,41,185,188,3,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1749-5016,,,SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR,Soc.

Electrophysiological rodent studies further indicate that oscillatory neuronal activity in homolog regions (i.e., prelimbic and infralimbic cortices) changes during fear expression and fear extinction recall. Whether similar processes occur in humans remains largely unexplored. By assessing scalp surface EEG in conjunction with LORETA source estimation of CS-related theta and gamma activity, we tested whether a priori defined ROIs in the human AMC and vmPFC similarly modulate their oscillatory activity during fear expression and extinction recall, respectively. To this end, 42 healthy individuals underwent a differential conditioning/differential extinction protocol with a Recall Test on the next day. In the Recall Test, nonextinguished versus extinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential (CS+ vs CS-) response with regard to skin conductance and AMC-localized theta power. Conversely, extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential response with regard to vmPFC-localized gamma power. Finally, individuals who failed to show a suppressed skin conductance response to the extinguished versus nonextinguished CS+ also failed to show the otherwise observed alterations in vmPFC gamma power to extinguished CS+. These results indicate that fear expression is associated with AMC theta activity, whereas successful fear extinction recall relates to changes in vmPFC gamma activity. The present work thereby bridges findings from prior rodent electrophysiological research and human neuroimaging studies and indicates that EEG is a valuable tool for future fear extinction research.","[Mueller, Erik M.; Panitz, Christian; Hermann, Christiane] Univ Giessen, Dept Clin Psychol, D-39354 Giessen, Germany; [Mueller, Erik M.; Pizzagalli, Diego A.] Harvard Univ, McLean Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Depress Anxiety & Stress Res, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Mueller, Erik M.; Pizzagalli, Diego A.] Harvard Univ, McLean Hosp, Sch Med, McLean Imaging Ctr, Belmont, MA 02478 USA",,"Mueller, EM (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Clin Psychol, Otto Behaghel Str 10F, D-39354 Giessen, Germany.",erik.mueller@psychol.uni-giessen.de,"Mueller, Erik/ABE-1757-2021; Panitz, Christian/AAJ-3506-2020; Pizzagalli, Diego A./Z-1595-2019; Mueller, Erik Malte/N-5710-2014","Mueller, Erik/0000-0002-8721-8963; Panitz, Christian/0000-0001-6692-8555; Mueller, Erik Malte/0000-0002-8721-8963",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG MU3535/2-1]; Gustav A.

The first group was instructed about the precise CS-US contingency before conditioning. The second group was instructed to discover the CS-US contingency. The third group did not receive any contingency instructions. We found facilitated fear acquisition (using skin conductance and startle) and increased contingency awareness in the first and second group compared to the third group.

As extinction represents a context-dependent form of new learning, one possible strategy to circumvent the return of fear is to conduct extinction across several environments. Here, we tested the effectiveness of multiple context extinction in a two-day fear conditioning experiment using 3-D virtual reality technology to create immersive, ecologically-valid context changes. Fear-potentiated startle served as the dependent measure. All three experimental groups initially acquired fear in a single context. A multiple extinction group then underwent extinction in three contexts, while a second group underwent extinction in the acquisition context and a third group underwent extinction in a single different context. All groups returned 24 h later to test for return of fear in the extinction context (spontaneous recovery) and a novel context (renewal and reinstatement/test). Extinction in multiple contexts attenuated reinstatement of fear but did not reduce spontaneous recovery. Results from fear renewal were tendential. Our findings suggest that multi-context extinction can reduce fear relapse following an aversive event - an event that often induces return of fear in real-world settings - and provides empirical support for conducting exposure-based clinical treatments across a variety of environments.

Some theories invoke a transfer of responses from unconditioned stimuli (US) to conditioned stimuli (CS), but this principle goes astray because responses to the US and CS can differ substantially. The idea that we introduce here is that the pattern of responses to a newly established CS does not come from the US but (at least partly) transfers from how one (learned to) respond(s) to previously encountered stimuli with threat value. So, we conceptualize threat value as a stimulus feature that allows responses to transfer between stimuli that share this feature (in the same way as, for example, overlap in color or shape can support transfer). In contrast to prevailing views, this new perspective focuses on the relation between the CS and already established threat signals rather than on the relation between the CS and the US. We discuss how this shared features perspective on human fear responding can inspire future directions in both the laboratory and clinical practice.","[Boddez, Yannick; Finn, Martin; De Houwer, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Boddez, Y (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium.; Boddez, Y (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium.",Yannick.Boddez@UGent.be,"De Houwer, Jan/ABF-6866-2021","De Houwer, Jan/0000-0003-0488-5224",Ghent UniversityGhent University [BOF16/MET_V/002],This work was funded by Ghent University grant BOF16/MET_V/002 awarded to Jan De Houwer.,,45,1,1,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-250X,2352-2518,,CURR OPIN PSYCHOL,Curr.

Ninety dogs were assigned to one of three treatments: control (control), comprising routine husbandry performed by shelter staff; human contact (HC), where dogs additionally received 2 min positive contact daily with an experimenter; or human contact + toys (HCT), where the additional human contact included the opportunity to interact with toys. Treatments were implemented daily from day 2 (second day in the shelter) until day 6. On day 7, the fear response towards the experimenter was assessed using salivary cortisol concentrations and a human avoidance test. The behavioural parameters measured were approach and withdrawal responses to the experimenter and time spent in each section of the pen while the experimenter was situated at each of three positions outside the pen: 2 m (position 1) or 1 m away from the pen gate (position 2) or crouched against the pen gate (position 3). On day 8, dogs were assessed by the shelter veterinarian for their suitability for adoption by the public. Treatment had no effect on salivary cortisol concentrations or the proportion of dogs selected for adoption. The results indicated that dogs in the HC and HCT treatments spent more time (P = 0.024) at the front of the pen when the experimenter was at position 3 than control dogs (HC 8.8 s, HCT 8.7 s, control 6.6 s from a possible 10 s). For those dogs that were not at the front of the pen when the experimenter was in position 3, a higher (P < 0.05) percentage of HCT dogs (100%) but not HC dogs (86%, P > 0.05) approached the experimenter compared with control dogs (45%). A second experiment on another 40 dogs examined if dogs, based on their behaviour in the human avoidance test, discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans. All dogs received the HC protocol as in Experiment 1 and were observed in the human avoidance test, however, all dogs were tested twice, once with the 'familiar' experimenter and once with an 'unfamiliar' experimenter. There were no significant (P > 0.05) familiarity or testing order effects, except that dogs approached the unfamiliar experimenter more (60%) than the familiar experimenter (29%) at position 2 (P < 0.05). The results indicate that additional positive human contact other than that associated with routine husbandry reduced the behavioural fear response of dogs to humans, but did not affect the proportion of dogs selected for adoption. The results also indicate that the shelter dogs did not discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans, in the handling context used in this study, suggesting a degree of stimulus generalisation may occur.

In Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) depend on a nearly continuous intake of berries, especially bilberries (Vaccinium myrtilius) during late summer and early autumn to fatten up prior to hibernation. This overlaps with the bear hunting season that starts on 21 August. Bilberry occurrence varies across space, as does human-induced mortality risk. Here, we hypothesize that brown bears select for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence across a boreal forest ecosystem in Sweden (H1), and that human-induced mortality risk reduces bear selection for bilberries (H2). In addition, we hypothesized that hears that survived the hunting season avoided bilberry areas associated with high risk, whereas bears that were later killed selected more strongly for berries and less against risk prior to the hunting season (H3). To evaluate our hypotheses, we used resource selection functions to contrast bear GPS relocation data (N = 3 5, 2012-2015) and random positions within the bears home range with generalized linear mixed effect models against two focal variables: a map predicting bilberry occurrence and a map predicting human-induced mortality risk. We found that bears selected for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence (supporting H1), but avoided these areas if they were associated with and high risk of hunting mortality (supporting H2). The killed and surviving bears did not differ in their selection for bilberries, hut they did differ in their selection against risk (partially supporting H3). Surviving bears strongly avoided high risk areas, whereas killed hears responded less to risk and selected for high-risk areas with a low probability of bilberry occurrence. This suggests that killed bears selected for other food sources than berries in high risk areas, which exposed them to human hunters. We conclude that bears respond to a landscape of fear during the berry season and that different foraging strategies may have a direct impact on individual mortality during the hunting season.

These results are of great interest, because the reduction of acquired fear associations is critical in therapies for anxiety disorders. We tested whether findings with respect to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and cannabinoid receptor (CB) systems in animals carry over to healthy human subjects. To that end, we administered selected doses of D-cycloserine (partial NMDA receptor agonist, 250 mg), delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, CB1 receptor agonist, 10 mg), or placebo prior to the extinction session of a 3-day conditioning protocol. D-cycloserine did not affect within-session extinction, or the retention of extinction in healthy human participants, in contrast with patient data but in line with previous reports in healthy volunteers. During extinction training, Delta 9-THC reduced conditioned skin conductance responses, but not fear-potentiated startle. This effect was not retained at the retention test 2 days later, suggesting it was dependent on acute effects of the drug. Our findings implicate that facilitation of the CB1 or NMDA system with the substances used in this study does not affect conditioned fear extinction lastingly in healthy humans. The apparent discrepancy between these findings and the results from (pre-)clinical trials is discussed in terms of room for improvement in these systems in healthy volunteers, and the lack of specificity of THC as a CB1 agonist.","[Baas, Johanna M.

Insights from this field could be beneficial as fear-related disorders are twice as prevalent in women compared to men. Here, we review an up-to-date summary of animal and human studies in adulthood that report sex differences in fear extinction from a structural and functional approach.

Exposure to human activity can cause animals to avoid human dominated areas or shift temporal activity patterns, but repeated, benign exposure can also result in habituation of individuals. Habituation is typically viewed as a negative potential consequence of human interactions with wildlife, with effects such as increased vulnerability of habituated animals to predation. Concurrently, the advancement of the understanding of the ecology of fear has shown reduced fitness in species because of behavioral changes in responses to fear of predators including humans. Here, we test how habituation and fear drive the foraging ecology of brown bears (Ursus arctos) feeding on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Southeast Alaska, USA. We used motion-detecting trail cameras at salmon spawning areas across a gradient of human disturbance to record human and bear activity at fine spatial and extended temporal scales. Higher human activity was associated with increased nocturnality of non-habituated bears, likely leading to suboptimal foraging, but had no effect on habituated individuals. For the top 20% of sites for which human activity was greatest, an average of 78.7% of the activity of non habituated bears was nocturnal, compared with an average of only 10.2% of the activity of habituated individuals. Habituation of brown bears in this system alleviated perceived risk and avoidance of human activity, allowing habituated individuals to overcome their fear of human presence and maximize foraging opportunities. While habituation may lessen some of the deleterious effects of human activity on large carnivores, the long-term effects of habituation may be negative, as habituated individuals may be at greater risk of depredation. Future research should examine whether habituated bears and their lower perceived risk of human activity ultimately experience smaller population-level effects of human disturbance than non-habituated individuals.","[Wheat, Rachel E.; Wilmers, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Wheat, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",rwheat@ucsc.edu,,,NSF GRFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This work was funded by an NSF GRF to R.E.W.

Laboratory animal studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning suggest that the amygdala is important for both forming stimulus associations and for subsequently expressing learned behavioral responses. In the present article, human amygdala activity was studied during the autonomic expression of conditional fear in two differential conditioning experiments with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and concurrent recording of skin conductance responses (SCRs). Trials were classified on the basis of individual participants' SCRs. Significant amygdala responding was detected only during trials on which a signal both predicted shock and elicited significant conditional SCR. Conditional stimulus presentation or autonomic activity alone was not sufficient. These results indicate that amygdala activity may specifically reflect the expression of learned fear responses and support the position that this region plays a central role in the expression of emotional reactions.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",,"Helmstetter, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",fjh@uwm.edu,"Smith, Christine N/K-1464-2018","Smith, Christine N/0000-0002-7760-4131; Knight, David/0000-0002-1094-801X; Helmstetter, Fred/0000-0003-3413-2418","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH060668, R01 MH060668] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH060668] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,38,88,89,2,14,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

Their adrenocortical responses to one of three treatments were then examined. These were: no human disturbance (undisturbed controls, CON), capture and return to the home cage before recapture and bleeding after 5 min (CR), or capture and manual restraint for 5 min before blood sampling (CREST). Quail of the HS line showed more fear-related behavior (crouching, escape) and avoidance of the experimenter than did their LS counterparts. Plasma B concentrations were markedly elevated following each capture treatment (CREST > CR) and the response appeared to be more pronounced in quail of the HS than the LS line. These findings indicate that HS quail perceived human contact to be more aversive than did those of the LS line. Avoidance scores and the adrenocortical responses to capture were positively correlated within individual birds. Therefore, simple behavioral tests of fear may have predictive value concerning physiological responsiveness to stressful stimulation.","LOUISIANA STATE UNIV,CTR AGR,DEPT POULTRY SCI,BATON ROUGE,LA 70803",,"JONES, RB (corresponding author), ROSLIN INST EDINBURGH,ROSLIN EH25 9PS,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,32,73,74,0,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0031-9384,,,PHYSIOL BEHAV,Physiol.

Previous human studies have shown that both the baseline and the fear-potentiated responses can be inhibited by anxiety-relieving drugs, suggesting drug activity on two different emotional states, the former reflecting a resting condition and the latter more akin to pathological anxiety. Objectives: To examine to which extent the reductions induced by a benzodiazepine on the basic and the fear-potentiated startle responses are of equal intensity, and whether or not the drug shows a predominant, i.e., selective, effect on either. Methods: The effects of three increasing doses of the benzodiazepine alprazolam (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg) were assessed on the human baseline and fear-potentiated startle responses. Twelve healthy volunteers attended the laboratory on four experimental days and received either alprazolam or placebo according to a double-blind crossover balanced design. Startle recordings were undertaken 2 h after drug intake. Fear potentiation was implemented by means of an electric-shock-anticipation experimental procedure. Additionally, subjective self-reports of sedation and anxiety and psychomotor performance were obtained at 2 and 3 h, respectively, after drug administration. Results: Alprazolam dose-dependently impaired psychomotor performance and produced increases in subjective anxiolytic activity and sedation, although the latter did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, the drug reduced the magnitude of the startle response both in the absence and in the presence of a threat-related cue, although a differentially greater inhibitory effect was seen on the fear-potentiated response as the dose increased. Conclusions: Alprazolam showed a greater inhibitory effect on the fear-potentiated startle than on the baseline reflex, suggesting a more selective action of the drug on those structures mediating potentiation of the behavioral response by anxiety.","Hosp Santa Cruz & San Pablo, Inst Recerca, Area Invest Farmacol, Barcelona 08025, Spain; Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Farmacol & Terapeut, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; Otto von Guericke Univ, Dept Neuropsychol, D-39112 Magdeburg, Germany",,"Barbanoj, MJ (corresponding author), Hosp Santa Cruz & San Pablo, Inst Recerca, Area Invest Farmacol, St Antoni Maria Claret 167, Barcelona 08025, Spain.",,"Rodriguez-Fornells, Antoni/L-5878-2014","Rodriguez-Fornells, Antoni/0000-0002-3249-6931; Riba, Jordi/0000-0002-9375-8421",,,,41,49,49,1,6,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,OCT,2001,157,4,,,,,358,367,,10.1007/s002130100816,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,483UW,WOS:000171655100004,11605094,,,,2022-03-23,

Pupil dilations in response to conditioned stimuli are increasingly used as a robust psychophysiological readout of fear learning, but their neural correlates remain unknown. We aimed at identifying the neural correlates of pupil responses to threat and safety cues during a fear learning task. Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects underwent a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pupillometry. After a stringent preprocessing and artifact rejection procedure, trial-wise pupil responses to threat and safety cues were entered as parametric modulations to the fMRI general linear models. Results: Trial-wise magnitude of pupil responses to both conditioned and safety stimuli correlated positively with activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and insula for the entire fear learning task, and with activity in the dACC during the fear conditioning phase in particular. Phasic pupil responses did not show habituation, but were negatively correlated with tonic baseline pupil diameter, which decreased during the task. Correcting phasic pupil responses for the tonic baseline pupil diameter revealed thalamic activity, which was also observed in an analysis employing a linear (declining) time modulation. Conclusion: Pupil dilations during fear conditioning and extinction provide useful readouts to track fear learning on a trial-by-trial level, particularly with simultaneous fMRI. Whereas phasic pupil responses reflect activity in brain regions involved in fear learning and threat appraisal, most prominently in dACC, tonic changes in pupil diameter may reflect changes in general arousal.","[Leuchs, Laura; Schneider, Max; Czisch, Michael; Spoormaker, Victor I.] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, D-80804 Munich, Germany",,"Spoormaker, VI (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Dept Translat Res Psychiat, Kraepelinstr 2-10, D-80804 Munich, Germany.",spoormaker@psych.mpg.de,,,Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities,VS acknowledges financial support by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

Such models have shown fear conditioning disrupts subsequent rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Here, we provide a translation of these models into humans. Using the fear potentiated startle (FPS) procedure, we examined the effects of fear conditioning and safety signal learning on subsequent REM sleep in healthy adults. We also examined the effects of changes in REM sleep on retention of fear and safety learning. Participants (n = 42 normal controls) spent 3 consecutive nights in the laboratory. The first was an adaptation night. Following the second night, we administered a FPS procedure that included pairing a wrist shock with a threat signal and a safety signal never paired with a shock. The next day, we administered the FPS procedure again, with no wrist shocks to any stimulus, to measure retention of fear and safety. Canonical correlations assessed the relationship between FPS response and REM sleep. Results demonstrated that increased safety signal learning during the initial acquisition phase was associated with increased REM sleep consolidation that night, with 28.4% of the variance in increased REM sleep consolidation from baseline accounted for by safety signal learning. Overnight REM sleep was, in turn, related to overnight retention of fear and safety learning, with 22.5% of the variance in startle retention accounted for by REM sleep. These data suggest that sleep difficulties, specifically REM sleep fragmentation, may play a mechanistic role in post-traumatic stress disorder via an influence on safety signal learning and/or threat-safety discrimination.","[Marshall, Anisa J.; Acheson, Dean T.; Risbrough, Victoria B.; Straus, Laura D.] Vet Adm San Diego Healthcare Syst, Res Serv, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Drummond, Sean P.

Contrary to previous behavioral-neural (fMRI) research on fear learning-in which the emotional expression of fear was generally indexed by skin conductance-we used fear-potentiated startle, a more reliable and specific index of fear. While we obtained concurrent fear-potentiated startle, neuroimaging (fMRI), and US-expectancy data, healthy participants underwent a fear-conditioning paradigm in which one of two conditioned stimuli (CS+ but not CS-) was paired with a shock (unconditioned stimulus [US]). Fear learning was evident from the differential expressions of fear (CS+ > CS-) at both the behavioral level (startle potentiation and US expectancy) and the neural level (in amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and insula). We examined individual differences in discriminative fear conditioning by classifying participants (as conditionable vs. unconditionable) according to whether they showed successful differential startle potentiation. This revealed that the individual differences in the emotional expression of discriminative fear learning (startle potentiation) were reflected in differential amygdala activation, regardless of the cognitive expression of fear learning (CS-US contingency or hippocampal activation). Our study provides the first evidence for the potential of examining startle potentiation in concurrent fMRI research on fear learning.","[Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Kindt, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Roetersstr 15, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.kindt@uva.nl,"Scholte, H.Steven/ABD-1737-2020","Scholte, H.Steven/0000-0002-9839-1788; Visser, Renee/0000-0003-0376-8165",,,,65,60,60,1,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1530-7026,,,COGN AFFECT BEHAV NE,Cogn.

Our work for the first time presents a comprehensive literature overview and methodological discussion on inter-individual differences in fear acquisition, extinction and return of fear. We tell a story from noise that steadily develops into a meaningful tune and converges to a model of mechanisms contributing to individual risk/resilience with respect to fear and anxiety related behavior. Furthermore, in light of the present 'replicability crisis' we identify methodological pitfalls and provide suggestions for study design and analyses tailored to individual difference research in fear conditioning. Ultimately, synergistic transdisciplinary and collaborative efforts hold promise to not only improve our mechanistic understanding but can also be expected to contribute to the development of specifically tailored ('individualized') intervention and targeted prevention programs in the future.","[Lonsdorf, Tina B.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany; [Merz, Christian J.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Bochum, Germany",,"Lonsdorf, TB (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany.",t.lonsdorf@uke.de,"Merz, Christian J/I-7635-2019","Merz, Christian J/0000-0001-5679-6595; Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846","research network 'European interdisciplinary study of fear conditioning, extinction learning and return of fear' (EIFEL-ROF) [DFG LO1980/2-1]; collaborative research center [58]; Research Unit 'Extinction learning: Neural mechanisms, behavioral manifestations, and clinical implications' [FOR 1581]; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG)","This work was supported by the research network 'European interdisciplinary study of fear conditioning, extinction learning and return of fear' (EIFEL-ROF, DFG LO1980/2-1) to TBL and CJM as well as the collaborative research center 58 'Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety disorders' (subprojects B07 and Z02 to TBL) and the Research Unit 'Extinction learning: Neural mechanisms, behavioral manifestations, and clinical implications' (FOR 1581; subproject P5 to CJM), which were all funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

The flight (time to join peers and avoidance distance), docility (isolation and handling) and fear (4 phases; responses of isolated heifers in (i), the absence (ii), the presence, of food and responses to a stationary human (iii) without and (iv) with visual contact with their peers) tests were carried out over three consecutive days, in that order, commencing on day 30 and again on day 81 post-housing. Animals were blood sampled twice, in a chute, between the two test sessions. Scores (low scores = more fearful) were assigned to the fear responses. Ten out of 19 variables were consistent over time. Consistency was more evident in the presence of a human, whereas agitation and avoidance of the animals were the most reliable measures. For each session, Principal Component Analysis showed that these behaviours were also consistent within different situations and that the two first components explained more than 55% of the variation of the data. Crossbred heifers showed stability for the consistent behaviours while purebred heifers were more fearful during the second test session. This study showed that fearfulness is a multi dimensional construct and that genetic factors as well as environmental factors affected the behavioural responses. Human-animal relationship can be assessed by measuring agitation while general fearfulness requires tests measuring different dimensions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Exaggerated physiological responses may contribute to increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this population, but whether treatment for PTSD can offset CVD risk remains unknown. To further evaluate physiological correlates of fear learning, we used a novel pre-clinical conditioned cardiovascular testing paradigm and examined the effects of Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction training on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) responses. We hypothesized that a fear conditioned cardiovascular response could be detected in a novel context and attenuated by extinction training. In a novel context, fear conditioned mice exhibited marginal increases in MAP (similar to 3 mmHg) and decreases in HR (similar to 20 bpm) during CS presentation. In a home cage context, the CS elicited significant increases in both HR (100 bpm) and MAP (20 mmHg). Following extinction training, the MAP response was suppressed while CS-dependent HR responses were variable. These pre-clinical data suggest that extinction learning attenuates the acute MAP responses to conditioned stimuli over time, and that MAP and HR responses may extinguish at different rates. These results suggest that in mouse models of fear learning, conditioned cardiovascular responses are modified by extinction training. Understanding these processes in pre-clinical disease models and in humans with PTSD may be important for identifying interventions that facilitate fear extinction and attenuate hyper-physiological responses, potentially leading to improvements in the efficacy of exposure therapy and PTSD-CVD comorbidity outcomes.","[Swiercz, Adam P.; Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Swiercz, Adam P.; Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Inst Neurosci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Seligowski, Antonia, V] Harvard Med Sch, McLean Hosp, Belmont, MA USA; [Park, Jeanie] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta VA Med Ctr, Div Renal Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Marvar, Paul J.] George Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"Marvar, PJ (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Physiol, Washington, DC 20052 USA.; Marvar, PJ (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Inst Neurosci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.; Marvar, PJ (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",pmarvar@gwu.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R00 HL107675-03, 1R01HL137103-01A1]; American Heart AssociationAmerican Heart Association [15CSA24340001]; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL137103] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01CX001065] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",PM was supported by NIH R00 HL107675-03 and 1R01HL137103-01A1.

Impaired fear extinction and enhanced fear acquisition and consolidation are hallmarks of fear-circuitry disorders; thus, we tested whether BL facilitates fear extinction and inhibits fear acquisition. We randomly exposed 29 healthy humans to high-(9000 lx) or low-intensity light (< 500 lx) for 15 min, near the nadir of the phase response to light, in a single-blind manner. Simultaneously with the light exposure, subjects performed fear extinction training and second fear acquisition, where a visual conditioned stimulus (CS), previously paired with an electric shock unconditioned stimulus (US), was presented without the US, while another CS was newly paired with the US. Conditioned responses (CRs) and changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity were determined during encoding and delayed recall sessions. BL-exposed subjects exhibited lower extinction related PFC activity and marginally higher acquisition-related PFC activity during light exposure than subjects exposed to control light. Twenty-four hours later, BL reduced CRs to both the extinguished and non-extinguished CSs with marginally lower extinction-related PFC activation, suggesting that BL enhanced fear extinction, while suppressing fear acquisition. Further, EL sustained tolerance to fear re-conditioning. Our results demonstrate that a single and brief BL exposure, synchronized with fear extinction and acquisition, instantaneously influences prefrontal hemodynamic responses and alleviates fear expression after 24 h. Although the specificity of BL effects deems further investigation, our findings indicate the clinical relevance of adjunctive BL intervention in exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for fear-circuitry disorders.","[Yoshiike, Takuya; Honma, Motoyasu; Kim, Yoshiharu; Kuriyama, Kenichi] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Behav Med, 4-1-1 Ogawa Higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan; [Yoshiike, Takuya; Yamada, Naoto; Kuriyama, Kenichi] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Psychiat, Seta Tsukinowa Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan; [Honma, Motoyasu] Kyorin Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Physiol, 6-20-2 Shinkawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818611, Japan",,"Yoshiike, T (corresponding author), Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Psychiat, Seta Tsukinowa Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202192, Japan.",yoshiike@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp; mhonma@ks.kyorin-u.ac.jp; naoto@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp; kim@ncnp.go.jp; kenichik@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp,"Yoshiike, Takuya/AAL-5150-2020; Honma, Motoyasu/M-7124-2018","Yoshiike, Takuya/0000-0002-6071-8167; Honma, Motoyasu/0000-0003-4612-0115","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program from the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Corporation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25670122, 15H04897]; Japan Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental HealthJapan Foundation for Neuroscience and Mental Health; Takeda Science FoundationTakeda Science Foundation (TSF); SENSHIN Medical Research FoundationSENSHIN Medical Research Foundation","We thank Professor Yoko Hoshi for her thoughtful suggestions on neuroimaging analyses.

Clinically, fear memory is also involved in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the neural mechanisms of fear thereby has both neuroscientific and clinical significance. In recent years, data from animal models have demonstrated the key role of the amygdala-hippocampal circuit in the development of fear. However, the neural processing of fear memory remains unclear in humans, which is mainly due to the limitation of indirect measure of neural activity. Methods Herein, we investigated fear memory by direct intracranial recordings from 8 intractable epilepsy patients with depth electrodes in both the hippocampus and ipsilateral amygdala. All the patients were subjected to a well-established Pavlovian fear memory paradigm consisted of the familiarization task, conditioning task, and retrieval task, respectively. Simultaneous local field potentials from the hippocampus and amygdala were recorded during different stages. The oscillatory activities from the amygdala and hippocampus were analyzed during fear memory retrieval compared with neutral stages. Results Consistent with previous rodent studies, our results showed that the amygdala was involved in fear memory retrieval rather than neutral memory retrieval, while the hippocampus was involved both in fear memory retrieval and neutral memory retrieval. In particular, we found that there was an enhanced synchronized activity between the amygdala and hippocampus at beta frequencies (14-30 Hz), which suggested that enhanced synchronized activity at beta frequencies between the amygdala and hippocampus play a pivotal role during retrieval of fear memory in human. Conclusions Thus, our observation that the amygdala-hippocampal system contributing to fear memory retrieval in human with frequency-depended specificity has provided new insights into the mechanism of fear and have potential clinical relevance.","[Wang, Di; Huang, Zhaoyang; Ren, Liankun; Hu, Minjing; Wang, Xueming; Du, Jialin; Wang, Yuping] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Neurol, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Wang, Di; Huang, Zhaoyang; Ren, Liankun; Hu, Minjing; Wang, Xueming; Du, Jialin; Wang, Yuping] Beijing Key Lab Neuromodulat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jing] Beijing Normal Univ, IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xueyuan; Yu, Tao; Ni, Duanyu; Zhang, Xi; Gao, Runshi; Qiao, Liang] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Funct Neurosurg, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xueyuan; Yu, Tao; Ni, Duanyu; Zhang, Xi; Gao, Runshi; Qiao, Liang] Beijing Inst Funct Neurosurg, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuping] Capital Med Univ, Ctr Epilepsy, Beijing Inst Brain Disorders, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuping] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Pediat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China",,"Wang, YP (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Neurol, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China.; Wang, YP (corresponding author), Beijing Key Lab Neuromodulat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China.; Wang, YP (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Ctr Epilepsy, Beijing Inst Brain Disorders, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China.; Wang, YP (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Pediat, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China.",wangyuping@xwhosp.org,,"Liu, Jing/0000-0002-9167-6190","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81771398, 81571271]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1314500]","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81771398, 81571271) and the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1314500).

The extinction using verbal instructions, called imaginal extinction, consists of a recorded voice encouraging participants to imagine the scene in which fear was acquired, and to envision the stimuli before their inner eye. The voice signals stimuli appearance, and identical to standard (in vivo) extinction, participants discover that the conditioned stimulus no longer is followed by unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In this way, imaginal extinction translates clinically used imaginal exposure into the standard experimental fear conditioning paradigm. Fear was acquired by pairing pictorial stimuli with an electric shock UCS. Then, both standard and imaginal extinction were given following fear memory reactivation, either after 10 min, within the reconsolidation interval, or after 6 h, outside of the reconsolidation interval. In vivo and imaginal extinction produced comparable reductions in conditioned responses during extinction and importantly, both disrupted reconsolidation of conditioned fear and abolished stimulus discrimination between reinforced and non-reinforced cues. Thus, disrupted reconsolidation of fear conditioning can be achieved without in vivo stimulus presentation, through purely cognitive means, suggesting possible therapeutic applications.

Since there is typically a delay between an initial fear experience and a situation in which fear (over)generalization may occur, we assessed delayed fear generalization and its neural signature. Moreover, as stress is known to affect fear learning, we further tested whether acute stress modulates fear generalization. Therefore, we conducted a two-day fear generalization study, with initial fear acquisition on Day 1 and a fear generalization test after a 24-hr delay in the MRI scanner. Prior to fear generalization testing, participants were exposed to a stressor or a control manipulation. Our behavioral data showed the expected generalization of fear. At a neural level, fear generalization was accompanied by increased fear-signaling for stimuli that resembled the conditioned stimulus in the bilateral insula and frontal operculum, whereas activity declined in frontal, hippocampal, and temporal regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, as stimuli became more similar to the conditioned stimulus. Importantly, stress did not modulate fear generalization, neither on a behavioral nor on a neural level. Interestingly, in an explorative comparison to two other studies that used the same paradigm but tested generalization immediately after acquisition, we observed increased fear generalization in the delayed relative to the immediate generalization test. In sum, our results suggest that stress leaves fear generalization and its neural signature unaffected but that a temporal delay might increase the extent to which fear responses are generalized to stimuli resembling the threatening stimulus.","[Kausche, Franziska Magdalena; Zerbes, Gundula; Schwabe, Lars] Univ Hamburg, Dept Cognit Psychol, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Kampermann, Lea; Buechel, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany",,"Schwabe, L (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Dept Cognit Psychol, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",lars.schwabe@uni-hamburg.de,,"Kausche, Franziska/0000-0002-1399-4708; Schwabe, Lars/0000-0003-4429-4373",German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG),"This work was supported by a grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG), in the context of the collaborative research center SFB/TRR58 Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorder",,49,0,0,8,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,NOV,2021,58,11,,,,,,,e13917,10.1111/psyp.13917,,AUG 2021,16,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,WC7AF,WOS:000682735500001,34365641,hybrid,,,2022-03-23,

In the current review, we present the current state of knowledge on the effects of exercise on fear extinction. Effects of exercise duration, explanations for conflicting results, and potential mechanisms, focusing on a hypothesized role for dopamine, are all discussed.

Therefore, its reduction is an important objective. Modifying the chicken-human relationship, perhaps via some form of regular handling or other human contact, is thought to be one way of achieving this objective. However, it is necessary to determine whether habituation (taming) of chicks to one particular person will generalise. Therefore, in the present study the approach/avoidance responses of handled (H) and nonhandled (NH) female ISA Brown domestic chicks towards a visible experimenter were examined in a series of five experiments in which the chicks' previous experience of humans and/or the experimenter's identity or clothing (colour and style) were systematically varied. Sample sizes in Experiments 1 to 5 were 20, 10, 10, 30 and 25 respectively. As expected, in each experiment, those chicks which had been handled twice daily from 1 day of age showed substantially less avoidance of the experimenter than did their nonhandled counterparts when they were tested at 10 or 11 days of age. Indeed, collective means of the summed mean scores of all the treatment groups used were 36.7 and 45.6 for H and NH, respectively. These results confirmed numerous observations that regular gentle handling is a reliable and potent method of reducing chicks' fear of humans. The present study also yielded a number of novel findings. In Experiment I, the chicks' habituation to one handler readily generalised to include a similarly dressed but otherwise unfamiliar experimenter of the opposite sex. The results of Experiments 2 and 3 extended this finding and showed that handled chicks responded similarly towards the experimenter regardless of systematic variations in the identities of either their handler or of the person who subsequently captured and tested the chick. Changing the colour (Experiment 4) or the style (Experiment 5) of the experimenter's clothing from that worn during treatment to that worn at test also failed to significantly influence the chicks' fear of humans, although a numerical trend towards reduced avoidance of the familiar clothing was apparent in both experiments. Collectively, the present results suggest that chickens which have been habituated to one person via regular handling will also show reduced fear of other people wearing either similar or different types of clothing. The apparent flexibility of the handling phenomenon is discussed in terms of its practical relevance.",,,"JONES, RB (corresponding author), ROSLIN INST EDINBURGH,ROSLIN EH25 9PS,MIDLOTHIAN,SCOTLAND.",,,,,,,49,47,47,3,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1591,,,APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI,Appl.

Human studies suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a role similar to PL in mediating or modulating fear responses. This study examined the role of dACC during fear conditioning in healthy humans with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Novel analyses were conducted on data from two cohorts that had previously undergone scanning to study fear extinction. Structural and functional brain data were acquired with MRI; the functional MRI (fMRI) component employed an event-related design. Skin conductance response (SCR) was the index of conditioned responses. Results: We found that: 1) cortical thickness within dACC is positively correlated with SCR during conditioning; 2) dACC is activated by a conditioned fear stimulus; and 3) this activation is positively correlated with differential SCR. Moreover, the dACC region implicated in this research corresponds to the target of anterior cingulotomy, an ablative surgical treatment for patients with mood and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Convergent structural, functional, and lesion findings from separate groups of subjects suggest that dACC mediates or modulates fear expression in humans. Collectively, these data implicate this territory as a potential target for future anti-anxiety therapies.","Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Nucl Magenet Resonance Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; McLean Hosp, Belmont, MA 02178 USA; Univ Puerto Rico, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; Dept Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Res Serv, Manchester, NH USA",,"Milad, MR (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Bldg 149,13th St,2nd Floor, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",milad@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu,"Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018",,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH072156] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1R21MH072156-1] Funding Source: Medline,,,41,347,354,1,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

The conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) (shock) during conditioning in the paired but not in the unpaired group. In the reaction time (RT) group, the US was a nonaversive visual signal for an RT task. In the paired group, the CS potentiated startle in the postconditioning phase. This conditioned response was fully retained over the retention interval. There was no substantial change in baseline startle (startle delivered in the absence of CS). By contrast, startle was not potentiated by the CS in the unpaired group, but baseline startle was increased from Session 1 to Session 2. In the RT group, startle was not affected by the CS, and baseline startle was reduced from Session 1 to Session 2.

To investigate this question, we sought commonalities between experimentally-induced fear via electric shocks and pre-existing phobia. Using functional MRI, we tested the effect of fear-conditioning pictures of dogs in 21 spider-fearful participants across three phases: baseline, post-conditioning, and extinction. Considering phobic stimuli as a reference point for the state of fear allowed us to examine whether fear-conditioning renders information patterns of previously neutral stimuli more similar to those of phobic stimuli. We trained a classification algorithm to discriminate information patterns of neutral stimuli (rats) and phobic stimuli and then tested the algorithm on information patterns from the conditioned stimuli (dogs). Performing this cross-decoding analysis at each experimental phase revealed brain regions in which dogs were classified as rats during baseline, as spiders following conditioning, and again as rats after extinction. A follow-up analysis showed that changes in visual perception information cannot explain the changing classification performance. These results demonstrate a common neural representation for processing fear-eliciting information, either pre-existing or acquired by classical conditioning.","[Levine, Seth M.; Rupprecht, Rainer; Schwarzbach, Jens V.] Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Str 84, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Pfaller, Michael; Reichenberger, Jonas; Shiban, Youssef; Muehlberger, Andreas] Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",,"Schwarzbach, JV (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Str 84, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",jens.schwarzbach@ukr.de,,,,,,38,6,6,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1749-5016,1749-5024,,SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR,Soc.

Fourteen percent of the Female students considered HIV/AIDS to be a threat compared with 10.1% of their male counterparts. Among all interviewees, 573 (76.7%) believed HIV/AIDS was a threat to romance at the university. Statistically significant association was found between the perceived fear of HIV/AIDS and gender. With regard to actual sexual intercourse, 86.4% of the students believed that HIV/AIDS was a major threat compared with 13.6% who did not. The association between the perception about HIV/AIDS as a threat to on-campus sexual intercourse and gender was statistically significant. Of the entire sample, 69.3% suggested abstinence as an approach to avoid HIV infection. Slightly more than 24% suggested condom use. Eighteen (10.8%) students advised that sexual contact should be only with a trusted partner. More information about HIV/AIDS should be provided to all students, especially women, in institutions of higher learning. More information can reduce the fear associated with this deadly disease.","Univ No Colorado, Dept Community Hlth & Nutr, Greeley, CO 80639 USA",,"Ebomoyi, EW (corresponding author), Univ No Colorado, Dept Community Hlth & Nutr, Gunter Hall 2350, Greeley, CO 80639 USA.",,,,,,,9,2,2,0,1,SLACK INC,THOROFARE,"6900 GROVE RD, THOROFARE, NJ 08086 USA",0027-9684,,,J NATL MED ASSOC,J.

It has long been known that fear serves to motivate avoidance. Consequently, fear extinction has been the primary focus in pre-clinical anxiety research for decades, under the implicit assumption that removing the motivator of avoidance (fear) would automatically mitigate the avoidance behaviors as well. Although this assumption has intuitive appeal, it has received little scientific scrutiny. The scarce evidence from animal studies is mixed, while the assumption remains untested in humans. The current study applied an avoidance conditioning protocol in humans to investigate the effects of fear extinction on the persistence of low-cost avoidance. Online danger-safety ratings and skin conductance responses documented the dynamics of conditioned fear across avoidance and extinction phases. Anxiety- and avoidance-related questionnaires explored individual differences in rates of avoidance. Participants first learned to click a button during a predictive danger signal, in order to cancel an upcoming aversive electrical shock (avoidance conditioning). Next, fear extinction was induced by presenting the signal in the absence of shocks while button-clicks were prevented (by removing the button in Experiment 1, or by instructing not to click the button in Experiment 2). Most importantly, post extinction availability of the button caused a significant return of avoidant button-clicks. In addition, trait-anxiety levels correlated positively with rates of avoidance during a predictive safety signal, and with the rate of pre- to post-extinction decrease during this signal. Fear measures gradually decreased during avoidance conditioning, as participants learned that button clicks effectively canceled the shock. Preventing button-clicks elicited a sharp increase in fear, which subsequently extinguished. Fear remained low during avoidance testing, but danger-safety ratings increased again when button-clicks were subsequently prevented. Together, these results show that low-cost avoidance behaviors can persist following fear extinction and induce increased threat appraisal. On the other hand, fear extinction did reduce augmented rates of unnecessary avoidance during safety in trait-anxious individuals, and instruction-based response prevention was more effective than removal of response cues. More research is needed to characterize the conditions under which fear extinction might mitigate avoidance.","[Vervliet, Bram] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Vervliet, Bram] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Vervliet, Bram] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Ctr Excellence Generalizat Hlth & Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Indekeu, Ellen] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Vervliet, B (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",bram.vervliet@ppw.kuleuven.be,"Vervliet, Bram/AAE-6276-2019","Vervliet, Bram/0000-0002-5904-4257",European CommunityEuropean Commission [PIOF-GA-2013-627743]; University of Leuven-KU LeuvenKU Leuven [PF/10/005],This research was supported by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme (PIOF-GA-2013-627743) and by a Center for Excellence grant from the University of Leuven-KU Leuven (PF/10/005).,,27,76,76,0,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Recently, we demonstrated that disrupting reconsolidation by a pharmacological manipulation specifically targeted the emotional expression of memory (i.e., startle response). Here we test in a human differential fear-conditioning paradigm with fear-relevant stimuli whether the spacing of a single unreinforced retrieval trial relative to extinction learning allows for rewriting the original fear association, thereby preventing the return of fear. In contrast to previous findings reported by Schiller et al. (2010), who used a single-method for indexing fear (skin conductance response) and fear-irrelevant stimuli, we found that extinction learning within the reconsolidation window did not prevent the recovery of fear on multiple indices of conditioned responding (startle response, skin conductance response and US-expectancy). These conflicting results ask for further critical testing given the potential impact on the field of emotional memory and its application to clinical practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

An open question is whether fear-related brain areas respond differently to experienced CS-US contingencies than to merely instructed CS-US contingencies. Here, we contrasted two experimental conditions where subjects were instructed to expect the same CS-US contingencies while only one condition was characterized by prior experience with the CS-US contingency. Using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, we found CS-related neural activation patterns in the right amygdala (but not in other fear-related regions) that dissociated between whether a CS-US contingency had been instructed and experienced versus merely instructed. A second experiment further corroborated this finding by showing a categoryindependent neural response to instructed and experienced, but not merely instructed, CS presentations in the human right amygdala. Together, these findings are in line with previous studies showing that verbal fear instructions have a strong impact on both brain and behavior. However, even in the face of fear instructions, the human right amygdala still shows a separable neural pattern response to experience-based fear contingencies.","[Braem, Senne; Demanet, Jelle; Brass, Marcel] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Braem, Senne; De Houwer, Xjan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Yuen, Kenneth S.

Some research indicates that risk exposure during sensitive periods makes adults more prone to acquiring long-term fearful phenotypes. However, chronic risk can also lead to ignoring threats in order to maintain other activities. We sought to assess how a relatively long period of low risk, experienced either early in life or by the previous generation, influences fear behaviour acquired from a short period of high risk as adults. We used fathead minnows as study subjects and simulated predation risk with repeated exposures to conspecific chemical alarm cues. The period of high risk experienced by adults induced typical fear behaviour (baseline freezing and neophobia), whereas the early-life low-risk period 1 year prior caused only a reduction in baseline foraging. We found no evidence that the early-life risk significantly altered the fear acquired from the adult-risk period. However, in a second experiment, a low-risk period during the parental generation interacted with a high-risk period experienced by the adult offspring. The combination of both risk periods heightened baseline freezing despite parental risk having little effect independently. Hence, our study provides evidence that parental risk exposure can lead to an additive intergenerational effect on fear acquisition in minnows.","[Crane, Adam L.; Brown, Grant E.] Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Meuthen, Denis; Thapa, Himal] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Meuthen, Denis] Univ Bonn, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Ecol, Bonn, Germany; [Ferrari, Maud C.

Assessing the nature of these alterations to trophic interactions requires an understanding of how species' demography and behavior are altered by simultaneous, complex pressures. For predator-prey relationships, landscapes of fear have been used to measure the trade-off prey animals make between maximizing energy gain and minimizing risk of predation. However, hierarchical foraging theory predicts that the degree to which aggregations of resources are used will depend upon the context in which they occur, not merely on the predation risk associated with those patches. We develop a conceptual framework that synthesizes theories of foraging hierarchies and landscapes of fear to show how predation risk and resource variation may interact to influence foraging behavior. We show, experimentally, that northern brown bandicoots (Isoodon macrourus), do respond to the likely predation risk when making their foraging decisions; however, the food resources in the habitat surrounding the food patch also play a significant role in the degree to which food patches are used. This result has important implications for the accuracy of assessments of landscapes of fear and habitat use using observations of animal foraging behavior.","[Searle, Kate R.; Stokes, Chris J.; Gordon, Iain J.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Sustainable, Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia",,"Searle, KR (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Sustainable, Davies Lab, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia.",krsearle@nrel.colostate.edu,"Gordon, Iain J/K-8636-2012; Gordon, Iain/S-8076-2019; Stokes, Chris J/G-5199-2010; Searle, Kate/F-4922-2011; Stokes, Chris/AAR-2890-2021","Gordon, Iain J/0000-0001-9704-0946; Gordon, Iain/0000-0001-9704-0946; Stokes, Chris J/0000-0003-1576-2457; Searle, Kate/0000-0003-4624-9023; Stokes, Chris/0000-0003-1576-2457",,,,47,38,40,2,82,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Prey species are thought to filter information on perceived predator encounter rates in physical landscapes into a landscape of fear defined by spatially explicit heterogeneity in predation risk. The presence of multiple predators using different hunting strategies further complicates navigation through a landscape of fear and potentially exposes prey to greater risk of predation. The juxtaposition of land cover types likely influences overlap in occurrence of different predators, suggesting that attributes of a landscape of fear result from complexity in the physical landscape. Woody encroachment in grasslands furnishes an example of increasing complexity with the potential to influence predator distributions. We examined the role of vegetation structure on the distribution of two avian predators, Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus), and the vulnerability of a frequent prey species of those predators, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We mapped occurrences of the raptors and kill locations of Northern Bobwhite to examine spatial vulnerability patterns in relation to landscape complexity. We use an offset model to examine spatially explicit habitat use patterns of these predators in the Southern Great Plains of the United States, and monitored vulnerability patterns of their prey species based on kill locations collected during radio telemetry monitoring. Both predator density and predation-specific mortality of Northern Bobwhite increased with vegetation complexity generated by fine-scale interspersion of grassland and woodland. Predation pressure was lower in more homogeneous landscapes where overlap of the two predators was less frequent. Predator overlap created areas of high risk for Northern Bobwhite amounting to 32% of the land area where landscape complexity was high and 7% where complexity was lower. Our study emphasizes the need to evaluate the role of landscape structure on predation dynamics and reveals another threat from woody encroachment in grasslands.","[Atuo, Fidelis Akunke; O'Connell, Timothy John] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",,"Atuo, FA (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",fidelis.atuo@okstate.edu,"O'Connell, Timothy J./A-2908-2011; O'Connell, Timothy/N-3851-2019","O'Connell, Timothy J./0000-0001-8215-2670; O'Connell, Timothy/0000-0001-8215-2670; Atuo, Fidelis/0000-0003-2950-0263",Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation [F11AF00069],"Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, Grant/Award Number: F11AF00069",,81,13,13,4,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Thus, we designed a study of human perception of all reptiles focusing on the relationship between perceived fear, disgust, and aesthetic preferences. Respondents evaluated various reptile images and the results revealed that people tend to perceive them as two clearly distinct groups based on their similar morphotypelegless reptiles (incl. snakes) and other reptiles with legs. In the case of snakes, the most feared species also tend to be perceived as beautiful. Compared to the most feared reptiles with legs (lizards, turtle, crocodiles), the legless once tend to be perceived as more disgusting. In both groups, species perceived as the least beautiful were the same as those rated as the most disgusting. Thus, reptiles cannot be rated as both beautiful and disgusting at the same time. Abstract Focusing on one group of animals can bring interesting results regarding our attitudes toward them and show the key features that our evaluation of such animals is based on. Thus, we designed a study of human perception of all reptiles focusing on the relationship between perceived fear, disgust, and aesthetic preferences and differences between snakes and other reptiles. Two sets containing 127 standardized photos of reptiles were developed, with one species per each subfamily. Respondents were asked to rate the animals according to fear, disgust, and beauty on a seven-point Likert scale. Evaluation of reptile species shows that people tend to perceive them as two clearly distinct groups based on their similar morphotype. In a subset of lizards, there was a positive correlation between fear and disgust, while disgust and fear were both negatively correlated with beauty. Surprisingly, a positive correlation between fear and beauty of snakes was revealed, i.e., the most feared species also tend to be perceived as beautiful. Snakes represent a distinct group of animals that is also reflected in the theory of attentional prioritization of snakes as an evolutionary relevant threat.","[Janovcova, Marketa; Sedlackova, Kristyna; Peleskova, Sarka; Zampachova, Barbora; Frynta, Daniel; Landova, Eva] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843, Czech Republic; [Janovcova, Marketa; Radlova, Silvie; Polak, Jakub; Sedlackova, Kristyna; Peleskova, Sarka; Zampachova, Barbora; Frynta, Daniel; Landova, Eva] Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Topolova 748, Klecany 25067, Czech Republic",,"Frynta, D (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843, Czech Republic.; Frynta, D (corresponding author), Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Topolova 748, Klecany 25067, Czech Republic.",Markii47@seznam.cz; Silka@atlas.cz; jakub.polak.cz@gmail.com; kristyna.sedlackova@email.cz; PeleskovaSarka@seznam.cz; barbora.zampachova@seznam.cz; frynta@centrum.cz; evalandova@seznam.cz,"Polák, Jakub/M-9927-2017; Frynta, Daniel/L-7350-2016; Rádlová, Silvie/D-5532-2017","Polák, Jakub/0000-0001-5005-3328; Frynta, Daniel/0000-0002-1375-7972; Rádlová, Silvie/0000-0003-3581-9780; Janovcova, Marketa/0000-0001-7647-8148","GACR (Czech Science Foundation)Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-15991S]; GAUK (Charles University Grant Agency) [346315, 1636218, LO1611]; MEYS under the NPU I program","This research was funded by GACR (Czech Science Foundation) 17-15991S and GAUK (Charles University Grant Agency) nr. 346315 and 1636218.

A parasite-induced ecology of fear might also exist if animals avoid parasite-contaminated resources when infection costs outweigh foraging benefits. To investigate whether animals avoid parasite contaminated sites, and if such avoidance balances disease costs and foraging gains, we monitored animal behavior at raccoon latrines - sites that concentrate both seeds and pathogenic parasite eggs. Using wildlife cameras, we documented over 40 potentially susceptible vertebrate species in latrines and adjacent habitat. Latrine contact rates reflected background activity, diet preferences and disease risk. Disease-tolerant raccoons and rats displayed significant site attraction, while susceptible birds and small mammals avoided these high-risk sites. This suggests that parasites, like predators, might create a landscape of fear for vulnerable hosts. Such non-consumptive parasite effects could alter disease transmission, population dynamics, and even ecosystem structure.","[Weinstein, Sara B.; Moura, Chad W.; Mendez, Jon Francis; Lafferty, Kevin D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Weinstein, SB (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",batrachoseps@gmail.com,"Lafferty, Kevin D./B-3888-2009",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1144085]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1601362] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (no. 1144085).,,69,24,24,2,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2018,127,7,,,,,927,934,,10.1111/oik.04866,,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GL1JE,WOS:000436856200003,,Bronze,,,2022-03-23,

Yet fear effects are not always the predominant driver of predator-prey interactions. Thus, guiding ecological principles have not been assembled to explain the broader food web interactions that shape the context dependency of carnivore-livestock conflict. We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework as a way to think about the contingencies under which inducing non-consumptive 'fear effects' on predators would be effective to mitigate carnivore-livestock conflict. The framework specifically considers interactions among wildlife (carnivore predators, wild ungulate prey) and humans (people and livestock) in terms of spatial predator-prey assemblages in which the nature of wildlife-human interactions - as either a carnivore-livestock conflict or a coexistence food web - is contingent on the nature of spatial movement and overlap of humans and wildlife across landscapes. Considering human-wildlife interactions within such a spatial food web context can assist in enabling people and wildlife, especially imperiled carnivores, to coexist in human-modified landscapes. The framework offers predictions that should be tested via adaptive management experiments that evaluate whether conflict mitigation solutions aligned with particular spatial human-livestock-carnivore contexts do indeed resolve conflict.","[Miller, Jennifer R.

It was recently reported that an extinction of 5 consecutive days prevents spontaneous recovery of fear memory. Memory age and the timing of fear extinction influence the effect of fear extinction. In this study, we used contextual fear extinction in adult male mice to examine whether memory age influences an extinction of 5 consecutive days and whether consecutiveness is necessary to prevent spontaneous recovery. Our results showed that, although fear memory was not affected by the passage of time, the old fear memory (28 days after fear conditioning) was more sensitive to fear extinction than the young fear memory (7 days after fear conditioning). Additionally, we demonstrated that consecutiveness of extinction sessions is not necessary to prevent spontaneous recovery. Instead, fear extinction sessions at spaced intervals were found to be more effective than consecutive extinction sessions for young fear memory. Our results suggest that taking memory age and the interval of fear extinction sessions into consideration would help to optimize exposure therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Meta-analyses of fear extinction learning primarily implicate consistent activation of brain regions linked to threat appraisal and experience, including the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices. An overlapping anatomical result was obtained from the meta-analysis of extinction recall studies, except when studies directly compared an extinguished threat stimulus to an unextinguished threat stimulus (instead of a safety stimulus). In this latter instance, more consistent activation was observed in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions, together with other areas including the hippocampus.

Predators can exert strong direct and indirect effects on ecological communities by intimidating their prey. The nature of predation risk effects is often context dependent, but in some ecosystems these contingencies are often overlooked. 2. Risk effects are often not uniform across landscapes or among species. Indeed, they can vary widely across gradients of habitat complexity and with different prey escape tactics. These context dependencies may be especially important for ecosystems such as coral reefs that vary widely in habitat complexity and have species-rich predator and prey communities. 3. With field experiments using predator decoys of the black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci), we investigated how reef complexity interacts with predation risk to affect the foraging behaviour and herbivory rates of large herbivorous fishes (e.g. parrotfishes and surgeonfishes) across four coral reefs in the Florida Keys (USA). In both high and low complexity areas of the reef, we measured how herbivory changed with increasing distance from the predator decoy to examine how herbivorous fishes reconcile the conflicting demands of avoiding predation vs. foraging within a reefscape context. 4. We show that with increasing risk, herbivorous fishes consumed dramatically less food (ca. 90%) but fed at a faster rate when they did feed (ca. 26%). Furthermore, we show that fishes foraging closest to the predator decoy were 40% smaller than those that foraged at further distances. Thus, smaller individuals showed muted response to predation risk compared to their larger counterparts, potentially due to their decreased risk to predation or lower reproductive value (i.e. the asset protection principle). Habitat heterogeneity mediated risk effects differently for different species of herbivores, with predation risk more strongly suppressing herbivore feeding in more complex areas and for individuals at higher risk of predation. 5. Predators appear to create a reefscape of fear that changes the size structure of herbivores towards smaller individuals, increases individual feeding rates, but suppresses overall amounts of primary producers consumed, potentially altering patterns of herbivory, an ecosystem process critical for healthy coral reefs.","[Catano, Laura B.; Rojas, Maria C.; Malossi, Ryan J.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Fourqurean, James W.; Burkepile, Deron E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miamif, FL 33181 USA; [Peters, Joseph R.] Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Catano, LB (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, Marine Sci Bldg,3000 NE 151st St, North Miamif, FL 33181 USA.",catanol@umsl.edu,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020; Fourqurean, James/AAY-9611-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Fourqurean, James/0000-0002-0811-8500; Peters, Joseph/0000-0002-9625-1626",NOAA Coral Reef Conservation ProgramNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1130786]; Division Of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1130786] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This work was supported by a grant from the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program to DEB and B.I.

Contingency awareness refers to the ability to verbalize the relationships between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. Although there is a heated debate about the influence of contingency awareness on conditioned fear responses, neural correlates behind the formation process of contingency awareness have gained only little attention in human fear conditioning. Recent animal studies indicate that the ventral striatum (VS) could be involved in this process, but in human studies the VS is mostly associated with positive emotions. To examine this question, we reanalyzed four recently published classical fear conditioning studies (n = 117) with respect to the VS at three distinct levels of contingency awareness: subjects, who did not learn the contingencies (unaware), subjects, who learned the contingencies during the experiment (learned aware) and subjects, who were informed about the contingencies in advance (instructed aware). The results showed significantly increased activations in the left and right VS in learned aware compared to unaware subjects. Interestingly, this activation pattern was only found in learned but not in instructed aware subjects. We assume that the VS is not involved when contingency awareness does not develop during conditioning or when contingency awareness is unambiguously induced already prior to conditioning. VS involvement seems to be important for the transition from a contingency unaware to a contingency aware state. Implications for fear conditioning models as well as for the contingency awareness debate are discussed. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3636-3644, 2009.

The lunar cycle dramatically alters night-time visibility, with low luminosity increasing hunting success of African lions. We used camera-trap data from Serengeti National Park to examine nocturnal anti-predator behaviours of four herbivore species. Interactions between predictable fluctuations in night-time luminosity and the underlying risk-resource landscape shaped herbivore distribution, herding propensity and the incidence of relaxed' behaviours. Buffalo responded least to temporal risk cues and minimised risk primarily through spatial redistribution. Gazelle and zebra made decisions based on current light levels and lunar phase, and wildebeest responded to lunar phase alone. These three species avoided areas where likelihood of encountering lions was high and changed their behaviours in risky areas to minimise predation threat.

In humans mainly functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used. To extend these findings to volumetric properties, 58 healthy participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and participated in a differential fear conditioning paradigm with contextual stimuli. Ratings of emotional valence, arousal, and contingency as well as skin conductance responses (SCRs) were used as indicators of conditioning. Twenty-nine participants with the smallest hippocampal volumes were compared with 29 persons with the largest hippocampal volumes. Persons with larger hippocampal volume (especially on the right side) learned to discriminate between two conditioned contexts, whereas those with small hippocampal volumes did not, as indicated by SCRs. Further analyses showed that these results could not be explained by amygdalar volumes. In contrast, the participant answers on the self-report measures were not significantly influenced by hippocampal or amygdalar, but by total brain volume, suggesting a role of cortical structures in these more cognitive evaluation processes. Reanalysis of the self-report data using partial hippocampal volumes revealed a significant influence of the posterior but not anterior subvolumes, which is in accordance with theories and empirical findings on hippocampal functioning. This study shows the relevance of hippocampal volume for contextual fear conditioning in healthy volunteers and may have important implications for anxiety disorders. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

The first step was to obtain a set of adoptive mothers habituated-to-human (H mothers) and a set of adoptive mothers non-habituated-to-human (NH mothers). A set of 6-month-old adult females was handling daily for 15 successive days whereas another set of 6-month-old adult females received no visual or physical contact with human during the same period. We then obtained two sets of adoptive mothers non-divergent in tonic immobility (TI) duration but divergent by the amount of fear behaviour expressed towards human (human observer test, cage-plus-experimenter test). Then, we compared a set of young raised by H mothers to a set of young raised by NH mothers. Observations and tests were carried out both during the brooding period (between 5 and 12 days of age) and after separation from mothers (between 13 and 90 days of age). Our results revealed that young raised by H mothers were less fearful towards a static human (cage-plus-experimenter test, hand-on-home-cage-door-test) as well as towards a moving human (human observer test and capture test) than young raised by NH mothers. Nevertheless, as was found between the two sets of adoptive mothers, no clear differences were found between the two sets of young concerning general emotional reactivity (tonic immobility test, open field test and hole-in-the-wall test). These results reveal that young bird's emotional reactivity to human could be modulated by the mother and that this maternal influence remains detectable well after the end of maternal contact.

Within vertebrates, the overall brain plan is highly conserved, though differences in size and complexity also exist. The forebrain differs the most between mammals and other vertebrates. The classic notion that the evolution of mammals led to radical changes such that new forebrain structures (limbic system and neocortex) were added has not held up nor has the idea that so-called limbic areas are primarily involved in emotion. Modern efforts have focused on specific emotion systems, like the fear or defense system, rather than on the search for a general purpose emotion systems. Such studies have found that fear circuits are conserved in mammals, including humans. Animal work has been especially successful in determining how the brain detects and responds to danger. Caution should be exercised when attempting to discuss other aspects of emotion, namely subjective feelings, in animals since there are no scientific ways of verifying and measuring such states except in humans.","NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"LeDoux, JE (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",joseph.ledoux@nyu.edu,,,"NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01 DA029053] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH046516, R01 MH038774] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH046516, R01MH038774] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA029053] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,112,102,104,8,98,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0079-6123,,978-0-44-453867-3; 978-0-44-453860-4,PROG BRAIN RES,Prog.

When confronted with a potential threat, an animal must select an appropriate defensive response based on previous experiences that are not identical, weighing cues and contextual information that may predict safety or danger. Like other aspects of fear memory, generalization is mediated by the coordinated actions of prefrontal, hippocampal, amygdalar, and thalamic brain areas. In this review article, we describe the current understanding of the behavioral, neural, genetic, and biochemical mechanisms involved in the generalization of fear. Fear generalization is a hallmark of many anxiety and stress-related disorders, and its emergence, severity, and manifestation are sex-dependent. Therefore, to improve the dialog between human and animal studies as well as to accelerate the development of effective therapeutics, we emphasize the need to examine both sex differences and remote timescales in rodent models.","[Asok, Arun; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Asok, Arun; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, HHMI, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA",,"Kandel, ER; Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Kandel, ER; Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Kandel, ER (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, HHMI, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Kandel, ER (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY 10032 USA.",erk5@columbia.edu; jbr2114@columbia.edu,,"Rayman, Joseph/0000-0003-0149-0024",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1F32-MH114306]; Cohen Veterans Bioscience; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH114306] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We are grateful for the support from the National Institute of Mental Health 1F32-MH114306 (AA), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (EK) and Cohen Veterans Bioscience (JR and EK).",,210,44,44,9,26,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Sustained anxiety is a crucial characteristic of most anxiety disorders which likely develops through contextual fear conditioning. This study investigated if and how genetic alterations of the 5-HT and the NPS systems as well as their interaction modulate contextual fear conditioning; specifically, function polymorphic variants in the genes coding for the 5-HT transporter (5HTT) and the NPS receptor (NPSR1) were studied. A large group of healthy volunteers was therefore stratified for 5HTTLPR (S+ vs. LL carriers) and NPSR1 rs324981 (T+ vs. AA carriers) polymorphisms resulting in four genotype groups (S+/T+, S+/AA, LL/T+, LL/AA) of 20 participants each. All participants underwent contextual fear conditioning and extinction using a virtual reality (VR) paradigm. During acquisition, one virtual office room (anxiety context, CXT+) was paired with an unpredictable electric stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US), whereas another virtual office room was not paired with any US (safety context, CXT-). During extinction no US was administered. Anxiety responses were quantified by fear-potentiated startle and ratings. Most importantly, we found a gene x gene interaction on fear-potentiated startle. Only carriers of both risk alleles (S+/T+) exhibited higher startle responses in CXT+ compared to CXT-. In contrast, anxiety ratings were only influenced by the NPSR1 polymorphism with AA carriers showing higher anxiety ratings in CXT+ as compared to CXT-. Our results speak in favor of a two level account of fear conditioning with diverging effects on implicit vs. explicit fear responses. Enhanced contextual fear conditioning as reflected in potentiated startle responses may be an endophenotype for anxiety disorders.","[Glotzbach-Schoon, Evelyn; Andreatta, Marta; Ewald, Heike; Troeger, Christian; Baumann, Christian; Muehlberger, Andreas; Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Reif, Andreas; Baumann, Christian; Deckert, Juergen] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychiat Psychosomat & Psychotherapy, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Muehlberger, Andreas] Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychol, Chair Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",,"Pauli, P (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",pauli@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Andreatta, Marta/Y-6551-2019","Andreatta, Marta/0000-0002-1217-8266; Pauli, Paul/0000-0003-0692-6720","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG): Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders [SFB-TRR 58, B01, Z02]; University of Wurzburg","This work is part of the dissertation of Evelyn Glotzbach-Schoon.

Although fMRI has helped translate insights about the anatomy of underlying brain circuits to humans, the temporal dynamics of neural fear processes remain opaque and require EEG. To date, studies on electrophysiological brain signals in humans have helped to elucidate underlying perceptual and attentional processes, but have widely ignored how fear memory traces evolve over time. The low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG demands aggregations across high numbers of trials, which will wash out transient neurobiological processes that are induced by learning and prone to habituation. Here, our goal was to unravel the plasticity and temporal emergence of EEG responses during fear conditioning. To this end, we developed a new sequential-set fear conditioning paradigm that comprises three successive acquisition and extinction phases, each with a novel CS+/CSset. Each set consists of two different neutral faces on different background colors which serve as CS+ and CS-, respectively. Thereby, this design provides sufficient trials for EEG analyses while tripling the relative amount of trials that tap into more transient neurobiological processes. Consistent with prior studies on ERP components, data-driven topographic EEG analyses revealed that ERP amplitudes were potentiated during time periods from 33-60 ms, 108-200 ms, and 468-820 ms indicating that fear conditioning prioritizes early sensory processing in the brain, but also facilitates neural responding during later attentional and evaluative stages. Importantly, averaging across the three CS+/CS- sets allowed us to probe the temporal evolution of neural processes: Responses during each of the three time windows gradually increased from early to late fear conditioning, while long-latency (460-730 ms) electrocortical responses diminished throughout fear extinction. Our novel paradigm demonstrates how short-, mid-, and long-latency EEG responses change during fear conditioning and extinction, findings that enlighten the learning curve of neurophysiological responses to threat in humans.","[Sperl, Matthias F.

However, its role in the regulation of fear responses appears more complex, brain site-specific, sex-specific, and dependent on a prior stress history. Studies have shown that OT neurons in the hypothalamus are activated during cued and contextual fear conditioning and during fear recall, highlighting the recruitment of endogenous oxytocin system in fear learning. OT is released into the extended amygdala, which contains the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), both critical for the regulation of fear and anxiety-like behaviors. Behavioral studies report that OT in the CeA reduces contextual fear responses; whereas in the BNST, OT receptor (OTR) neurotransmission facilitates cued fear and reduces fear responses to un-signaled, diffuse threats. These ostensibly contrasting behavioral effects support growing evidence that OT works to promote fear discrimination by reducing contextual fear or fear of diffuse threats, yet strengthening fear responses to imminent and predictable threats. Recent studies from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) support this notion and show that activation of OTR in the BLA facilitates fear discrimination by increasing fear responses to discrete cues. Also, OTR transmission in the CeA has been shown to mediate a switch from passive freezing to active escape behaviors in confrontation with an imminent, yet escapable threat but reduce reactivity to distant threats. Therefore, OT appears to increase the salience of relevant threat-signaling cues yet reduce fear responses to un-signaled, distant, or diffuse threats. Lastly, OTR signaling has been shown to underlie emotional discrimination between conspecifics during time of distress, social transmission of fear, and social buffering of fear. As OT has been shown to enhance salience of both positive and negative social experiences, it can also serve as a warning system against potential threats in social networks. Here, we extend the social salience hypothesis by proposing that OT enhances the salience of relevant environmental cues also in non-social contexts, and as such promotes active defensive behaviors.","[Olivera-Pasilio, Valentina; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Ctr Neurobiol Stress Resilience & Psychiat Disord, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Olivera-Pasilio, Valentina; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Discipline Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Olivera-Pasilio, Valentina; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Sch Grad & Postdoctoral Studies, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA",,"Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Ctr Neurobiol Stress Resilience & Psychiat Disord, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.; Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Discipline Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.; Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Sch Grad & Postdoctoral Studies, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",joanna.dabrowska@rosalindfranklin.edu,,,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH113007, R01MH113007-04S1]; Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science","This work was supported by grant from the National Institute of Mental Health R01MH113007 and R01MH113007-04S1 to JD and start-up funds from the Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science to JD.",,100,8,8,7,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

Here, we examined the effect of a conditioned rat's fear memory retrieval on a naive cage-mate's behavior to the conditioned stimulus. We show that rats exposed to a novel tone in the presence of a cage-mate previously conditioned to that same tone selectively showed increased freezing to the stimulus the next day (fear conditioning by-proxy). In addition, fear conditioning by-proxy experienced prior to pairing the tone to a mild shock increased freezing during presentation of that tone the next day.

Discrimination trainings are promising approaches for reducing such fear over-generalization. Here we investigated the efficacy of a fear-relevant vs. a fear-irrelevant discrimination training on fear generalization and whether the effects are increased with feedback during training. Eighty participants underwent two fear acquisition blocks, during which one face (conditioned stimulus, CS+), but not another face (CS-), was associated with a female scream (unconditioned stimulus, US). During two generalization blocks, both CSs plus four morphs (generalization stimuli, GS1-GS4) were presented. Between these generalization blocks, half of the participants underwent a fear-relevant discrimination training (discrimination between CS+ and the other faces) with or without feedback and the other half a fear-irrelevant discrimination training (discrimination between the width of lines) with or without feedback. US expectancy, arousal, valence ratings, and skin conductance responses (SCR) indicated successful fear acquisition. Importantly, fear-relevant vs. fear-irrelevant discrimination trainings and feedback vs. no feedback reduced generalization as reflected in US expectancy ratings independently from one another. No effects of training condition were found for arousal and valence ratings or SCR. In summary, this is a first indication that fear-relevant discrimination training and feedback can improve the discrimination between threat and safety signals in healthy individuals, at least for learning-related evaluations, but not evaluations of valence or (physiological) arousal.","[Herzog, Katharina; Andreatta, Marta; Schneider, Kristina; Pauli, Paul] Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany; [Andreatta, Marta] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ Sci & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Schiele, Miriam A.; Domschke, Katharina] Univ Freiburg, Fac Med, Med Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Freiburg, Germany; [Romanos, Marcel] Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychosomat & Ps, Wurzburg, Germany; [Deckert, Juergen] Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Psychiat Psychosomat & Psychotherapy, Wurzburg, Germany",,"Pauli, P (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Mental Hlth, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany.",pauli@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Andreatta, Marta/Y-6551-2019; Romanos, Marcel/D-7695-2017","Andreatta, Marta/0000-0002-1217-8266; Romanos, Marcel/0000-0001-7628-8299; Schiele, Miriam/0000-0003-2613-6515","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [44541416-TRR 58]; University of Wurzburg","The work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)-project no. 44541416-TRR 58 Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders within project Z02 to PP, JD, MR, and KD.

However, most of the studies in humans do not link startle potentiation and neural activity during fear acquisition and extinction. Therefore, we examined startle blink responses measured with electromyography (EMG) and brain activity measured with functional MRI simultaneously during differential conditioning. Furthermore, we combined these behavioral fear indices with brain network activity by analyzing the brain activity evoked by the startle probe stimulus presented during conditioned visual threat and safety cues as well as in the absence of visual stimulation. In line with previous research, we found a fear-induced potentiation of the startle blink responses when elicited during a conditioned threat stimulus and a rapid decline of amygdala activity after an initial differentiation of threat and safety cues in early acquisition trials. Increased activation during processing of threat cues was also found in the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). More importantly, our results depict an increase of brain activity to probes presented during threatening in comparison to safety cues indicating an involvement of the anterior insula, the ACC, the thalamus, and the PAG in fear-potentiated startle processing during early extinction trials. Our study underlines that parallel assessment of fear-potentiated startle in fMRI paradigms can provide a helpful method to investigate common and distinct processing pathways in humans and animals and, thus, contributes to translational research.

This study discusses sex-specific aspects of the recognition of the facial expression of fear using results from our previously published experimental study. We conducted an experiment in which 201 participants judged seven different facial expressions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise (Trnka et al. 2007). Participants were able to recognize the facial expression of fear significantly better on a male face than on a female face. Females also recognized fear generally better than males. The present study provides a new interpretation of this sex difference in the recognition of fear. We interpret these results within the paradigm of human ethology, taking into account the adaptive function of the facial expression of fear. We argue that better detection of fear might be crucial for females under a situation of serious danger in groups of early hominids. The crucial role of females in nurturing and protecting offspring was fundamental for the reproductive potential of the group. A clear decoding of this alarm signal might thus have enabled the timely preparation of females for escape or defence to protect their health for successful reproduction. Further, it is likely that males played the role of guardians of social groups and that they were responsible for effective warnings of the group under situations of serious danger. This may explain why the facial expression of fear is better recognizable on the male face than on the female face.","[Trnka, Radek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Humanities, Prague, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Radek; Tavel, Peter] Prague Coll Psychosocial Studies, Prague 10900 10, Czech Republic; [Tavel, Peter; Hasto, Jozef] Palacky Univ, OUSHI, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Tavel, Peter] Safarik Univ, Fac Med, Inst Publ Hlth, Hlth Psychol Unit, Kosice, Slovakia; [Hasto, Jozef] Psychiat Clin, Trencin, Slovakia; [Hasto, Jozef] St Elisabeth Univ Hlth & Social Sci, Bratislava, Slovakia",,"Trnka, R (corresponding author), Prague Coll Psychosocial Studies, Sci & Res Dept, Milanska 471, Prague 10900 10, Czech Republic.",trnkar@volny.cz,"Trnka, Radek/S-7776-2017; Tavel, Peter/AAG-9216-2020","Trnka, Radek/0000-0003-3731-468X; Tavel, Peter/0000-0001-7072-001X",Zdenek Klein Award; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic via the project Spirituality and Health among Adolescents and Adults in the Czech Republic [GA 15-19968S],This work was supported by the Zdenek Klein Award 2007 and the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic via the project Spirituality and Health among Adolescents and Adults in the Czech Republic (GA 15-19968S).,,48,3,3,0,29,MAGHIRA & MAAS PUBLICATIONS,STOCKHOLM,"PO BOX 26132, S-100 41 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN",0172-780X,,,NEUROENDOCRINOL LETT,Neuroendocrinol.

In this model, an organism is trained to predict an aversive unconditioned stimulus from initially neutral events (conditioned stimuli, CS). In humans, fear memory is typically measured via conditioned autonomic responses or fear-potentiated startle. For the latter, various analysis approaches have been developed, but a systematic comparison of competing methodologies is lacking. Here, we investigate the suitability of a model-based approach to startle eyeblink analysis for assessment of fear memory, and compare this to extant analysis strategies. First, we build a psychophysiological model (PsPM) on a generic startle response. Then, we optimize and validate this PsPM on three independent fear-conditioning data sets. We demonstrate that our model can robustly distinguish aversive (CS+) from nonaversive stimuli (CS-, i.e., has high predictive validity). Importantly, our model-based approach captures fear-potentiated startle during fear retention as well as fear acquisition. Our results establish a PsPM-based approach to assessment of fear-potentiated startle, and qualify previous peak-scoring methods. Our proposed model represents a generic startle response and can potentially be used beyond fear conditioning, for example, to quantify affective startle modulation or prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response.","[Khemka, Saurabh; Tzovara, Athina; Gerster, Samuel; Quednow, Boris B.; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Khemka, Saurabh; Tzovara, Athina; Quednow, Boris B.; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Tzovara, Athina; Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England",,"Bach, DR (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Hosp Psychiat, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",dominik.bach@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik R/B-4302-2019; Quednow, Boris B./A-1666-2008","Bach, Dominik R/0000-0003-3717-2036; Quednow, Boris B./0000-0001-7933-2865; Gerster, Samuel/0000-0001-6507-739X; Tzovara, Athina/0000-0002-7588-1418",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [320030_1449586/ 1]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [091593/Z/10/Z],We thank Mahnoor Anwar for assistance in data collection.

A novel perceptual discrimination training task was therefore designed to moderate fear over generalization. We hypothesized that improvement in basic perceptual discrimination would translate into lower fear overgeneralization in affective cues. Seventy adults completed a fear-conditioning task prior to being allocated into training or placebo groups. Predesignated geometric shape pairs were constructed for the training task. A target shape from each pair was presented. Thereafter, participants in the training group were shown both shapes and asked to identify the image that differed from the target. Placebo task participants only indicated the location of each shape on the screen. All participants then viewed new geometric pairs and indicated whether they were identical or different. Finally, participants completed a fear generalization test consisting of perceptual morphs ranging from the CS + to the CS-. Fear-conditioning was observed through physiological and behavioural measures. Furthermore, the training group performed better than the placebo group on the assessment task and exhibited decreased fear generalization in response to threat/safety cues. The findings offer evidence for the effectiveness of the novel discrimination training task, setting the stage for future research with clinical populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Fear is a defensive mechanism evolved to protect animals from danger by balancing the animals' needs for primary resources with the risk of predation, and the amygdala is implicated in mediating fear responses. However, the functions of fear and amygdala in foraging behavior are not well characterized because of the technical difficulty in quantifying prey-predator interaction with real (unpredictable) predators. Thus, the present study investigated the rat's foraging behavior in a seminaturalistic environment when confronted with a predator-like robot programmed to surge toward the animal seeking food. Rats initially fled into the nest and froze (demonstrating fear) and then cautiously approached and seized the food as a function of decreasing nest-food and increasing food-robot distances. The likelihood of procuring food increased and decreased via lesioning/inactivating and disinhibiting the amygdala, respectively. These results indicate that the amygdala bidirectionally regulates risk behavior in rats foraging in a dynamic fear environment.","[Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kim, Jeansok J.] Univ Washington, Program Neurobiol & Behav, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Choi, June-Seek] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul 136701, South Korea",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Psychol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jeansokk@u.washington.edu,,"Kim, Jeansok/0000-0001-7964-106X","Korean governmentKorean Government [MEST 2009-008145]; Ministry of Education, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of Korea [2009K001284]; Republic of Korea; Seoul Broadcasting System Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MH64457]; James McKeen Cattell Sabbatical Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH064457] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Paul E.

However, preventing the return of fear is still a major challenge after this behavioral treatment. An increasing number of studies suggest that high-dose glucocorticoid treatment immediately after trauma can alleviate the symptoms of PTSD in humans. Unknown is whether high-dose glucocorticoid treatment following fear conditioning suppresses the return of fear. In the present study, a typical fear renewal paradigm (AAB) was used, in which the fear response to an auditory cue can be restored in a novel context (context B) when both training and extinction occur in the same context (context A). We trained rats for auditory fear conditioning and administered corticosterone (CORT; 5 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle with different delays (1 and 24 h). Forty-eight hours after drug injection, extinction was conducted with no drug in the training context, followed by a test of tone-induced freezing behavior in the same (AAA) or a shifted (AAB) context. Both immediate and delayed administration of high-dose CORT after fear conditioning reduced fear renewal. To examine the anxiolytic effect of CORT, independent rats were trained for cued or contextual fear conditioning, followed by an injection of CORT (5 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle at a 1 or 24 h delay. One week later, anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) before and after fear expression. We found that high-dose CORT decreased anxiety-like behavior without changing tone- or context-induced freezing. These findings indicate that a single high-dose CORT administration given after fear conditioning may selectively suppress fear renewal by reducing anxiety-like behavior and not by altering the consolidation, retrieval, or extinction of fear memory.

Some of this effect occurs because the animals become afraid, either of people in general, or of specific individuals as a result of aversive handling. In this paper, we review a number of studies showing that farm animals handled roughly or aversively learn to associate the handling with people, and that this learned fear of people can have marked effects on production. The ability to recognize individual people has now been shown indisputably for many species of farm animals, although under some circumstances, animals do not behave differently to different people. Animals' learned fear of individual people can markedly affect their productivity. For example, in dairy cattle, the presence of an aversive handler during milking can reduce milk yield and substantially increase residual milk. Pigs appear to use multiple cues to distinguish people, although visual cues are clearly important. Cows can readily learn to distinguish between people wearing different colour clothes, but it is more difficult for them to distinguish between people wearing the same colour. Furthermore, cows' responses to people change markedly when clothing colour is changed, although this does not seem to be true for poultry. However, animals' responses to people can be affected by the context. For example, cattle's learned responses to individuals can be strongly affected by the place they are in. We finish with some suggestions as to how these results can be used to reduce fear in farm animals. Crown copyright (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

These cues can either be direct (i.e. signalling the possible presence of a predator) or indirect (i.e. linked to the likelihood of encountering a predator). How then do herbivores negotiate these multiple cues in the landscape? And which type of cues do foraging herbivores use to assess variation in predation risk? We examined these questions by investigating the foraging responses of a free-ranging marsupial herbivore, the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula to perceived predation risk. We found that indirect habitat-related cues of predation (i.e. feeder location) consistently influenced foraging, while other more variable indirect (i.e. illumination) and direct cues (i.e. predator odour) did not. Giving-up-density at above-ground feeders was always lower than at on-ground feeders. Possums spent more time and foraged more at the above-ground feeders than at the on-ground feeders. Our results demonstrate that when multiple cues are present, varying in the accuracy of the information they provide about predation risk, possums respond to habitat-related cues. Possums manage risk by modifying behaviours, reducing time spent foraging in areas where potential risk is perceived as high. Thus, when the location of a predator at a certain point in time and space is unknown, and food demands are high, habitat-related cues are a safe choice to assess predation risk, with reliable returns for free-ranging herbivores.","[Mella, V.

Like sustenance, danger is biologically relevant, and neutral cues can take on great salience when they predict a threat to survival. In anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this type of conditioned fear fails to extinguish, and reminders of traumatic events can cause pathological conditioned fear responses for decades after danger has passed. In this review, we use fear conditioning and extinction studies to draw a direct line from Pavlov to PTSD and other anxiety disorders. We explain how rodent studies have informed neuroimaging studies of healthy humans and humans with PTSD. We describe several genes that have been linked to both PTSD and fear conditioning and extinction and explain how abnormalities in fear conditioning or extinction may reflect a general biomarker of anxiety disorders. Finally, we explore drug and neuromodulation treatments that may enhance therapeutic extinction in anxiety disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although this fear generalization is generally adaptive, fear overgeneralization is maladaptive and assumed to contribute to anxiety disorders. Despite the clinical relevance of fear (over)generalization, how the extent of fear generalization is modulated remains not well understood. Based on the known effects of stress on learning and memory, we tested here the impact of major stress mediators, glucocorticoids and noradrenergic arousal, on fear generalization. In a laboratory-based, placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subject design, 125 healthy participants first underwent a fear conditioning procedure. About 24 h later, participants received orally either a placebo, hydrocortisone, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, leading to increased noradrenergic stimulation, or both drugs before a test of fear generalization. Skin conductance responses as well as explicit rating data revealed that yohimbine intake led to enhanced fear memory expression, i.e. an enhanced responding to the CS+ but not to stimuli resembling the CS+ . Moreover, neither enhanced safety learning nor a mere enhancement of perceptual discrimination ability could explain this result. In contrast to yohimbine, hydrocortisone had no significant effect on fear memory. These findings suggest that noradrenergic arousal strengthens fear memory expression and have important implications for mental disorders in which the overgeneralization of conditioned fear is prominent.

Animal research suggests that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a key role in the maintenance of extinguished fear. Here, we combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the role of GABA in fear recovery in 70 healthy male participants. We associated baseline GABA levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) to indices of fear recovery as defined by changes in skin conductance responses (SCRs), blood oxygen level dependent responses, and functional connectivity from fear extinction to fear retrieval. The results showed that high GABA levels were associated with increased SCRs, enhanced activation of the right amygdala, and reduced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity during fear recovery. Follow-up analyses exclusively for the extinction phase showed that high GABA levels were associated with reduced amygdala activation and enhanced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity, despite the absence of correlations between GABA and physiological responses. Follow-up analyses for the retrieval phase did not show any significant associations with GABA. Together, the association between GABA and increases in SCRs from extinction to retrieval, without associations during both phases separately, suggests that dACC GABA primarily inhibits the consolidation of fear extinction. In addition, the opposite effects of GABA on amygdala activity and connectivity during fear extinction compared to fear recovery suggest that dACC GABA may initially facilitate extinction learning.","[Levar, Nina; van Leeuwen, Judith M.

To date the effects of acute stress on extinction learning in humans are not well understood. Models of stress effects on emotional memory suggest that learning during the so-called first wave of the stress response will be enhanced. The first wave includes (among others) increases of noradrenaline in the brain and increased sympathetic tone, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the periphery while the second wave includes genomic glucocorticoid-actions. The cold pressor test (CPT) is a valid way to induce the first wave of the stress response. We thus hypothesized that the CPT will facilitate extinction. In a 2-day fear-conditioning procedure with 40 healthy men, using differential skin conductance responses as a measure of conditioned fear, we placed the CPT versus a control procedure prior to extinction training on Day 1. We tested for extinction learning on Day 1 and extinction retrieval on Day 2. During extinction training (Day 1) only the CPT-group showed a significant reduction in differential responding. This was still evident on Day 2, where the CPT group had less differential responding during early trials (retrieval) and a higher extinction retention index. This is the first human study to show that a simple procedure, triggering the first-wave stress response the CPT can effectively enhance fear extinction in humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Competition between these two responses often results in a return of fear, limiting control over anxiety. However, one hypothesis holds that a pharmacologic strategy aimed at reducing amygdala activity while simultaneously augmenting medial prefrontal cortex function could facilitate the extinction of conditioned fear. METHODS: Key among the endogenous inhibitors of amygdala activity in response to social fear signals is the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin. To address the question whether oxytocin can strengthen Pavlovian extinction beyond its role in controlling social fear, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with 62 healthy male participants in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design. Specifically, subjects were exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm before receiving an intranasal dose (24 IU) of synthetic oxytocin or placebo. RESULTS: Oxytocin, when administered intranasally after Pavlovian fear conditioning, was found to increase electrodermal responses and prefrontal cortex signals to conditioned fear in the early phase of extinction and to enhance the decline of skin conductance responses in the late phase of extinction. Oxytocin also evoked an unspecific inhibition of amygdalar responses in both phases. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings identify oxytocin as a differentially acting modulator of neural hubs involved in Pavlovian extinction. This specific profile of oxytocin action may open up new avenues for enhancing extinction-based therapies for anxiety disorders.","[Eckstein, Monika; Becker, Benjamin; Scheele, Dirk; Scholz, Claudia; Preckel, Katrin; Schlaepfer, Thomas E.; Maier, Wolfgang; Hurlemann, Rene] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychiat, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Eckstein, Monika; Becker, Benjamin; Scheele, Dirk; Scholz, Claudia; Preckel, Katrin; Hurlemann, Rene] Univ Bonn, Div Med Psychol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Schlaepfer, Thomas E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychiat, Baltimore, MD USA; [Schlaepfer, Thomas E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mental Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Grinevich, Valery] German Canc Res Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany; [Kendrick, Keith M.] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Key Lab Neuroinformat, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Maier, Wolfgang] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis, Bonn, Germany",,"Hurlemann, R (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Psychiat, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.",renehurlemann@icloud.com,"Hurlemann, Rene/AAL-5515-2020; Scheele, Dirk/K-1194-2015; Hurlemann, Rene/G-4164-2012; Becker, Benjamin/W-4971-2017; Preckel, Katrin/O-5169-2019","Hurlemann, Rene/0000-0003-2628-565X; Scheele, Dirk/0000-0002-7613-0376; Hurlemann, Rene/0000-0003-2628-565X; Becker, Benjamin/0000-0002-9014-9671; Preckel, Katrin/0000-0003-1498-3813; Grinevich, Valery/0000-0002-6337-8866; Schlaepfer, Thomas/0000-0003-0612-9692; Eckstein, Monika/0000-0002-1846-4992","Starting Independent Researcher Grant (Neuromodulation of Emotion research group); Ministry of Innovation, Science, Research & Technology of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia [91132720]; University of Bonn [91132720]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91132720]","This work was supported by a Starting Independent Researcher Grant (Neuromodulation of Emotion research group) jointly provided by the Ministry of Innovation, Science, Research & Technology of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the University of Bonn (RH) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No. 91132720 (KMK).",,75,121,127,3,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Generally, the idea is that by virtue of the formation of associations or acquired propositional knowledge about the relation between neutral movements and pain, these movements may signal pain, and hence start to elicit defensive fear responses (eg, avoidance behavior). This assumption has never been investigated experimentally. Therefore, we developed a pain-relevant fear conditioning paradigm using a movement as a conditioned stimulus (CS) and a painful electrocutaneous stimulus as an unconditioned stimulus (US) to examine the acquisition of fear of movement-related pain in healthy subjects. In a within-subjects design, participants manipulated a joystick to the left/right in the experimental (predictable) condition, and upward/downward in the control (unpredictable) condition or vice versa. In the predictable condition, one movement direction (CS+), and not the other (CS-), was followed by painful stimuli. In the unpredictable condition, painful stimuli were always delivered during the inter-trial interval. Both fear of movement-related pain ratings and eyeblink startle measures were more elevated in response to the CS+ than to the CS-, whereas no differences occurred between both unreinforced CSs in the control condition. Participants were slower initiating a CS+ movement than a CS- movement, while response latencies to CSs in the control condition did not differ. These data support the acquisition of fear of movement-related pain by associative learning.

For centuries, the goal has been to kill sharks that come near boats or beaches. Yet, there is a growing trend of more positive feelings toward local shark populations. In this article, we demonstrate that feelings of pride toward sharks can serve as an opposing force to fear, and can moderate the way fear affects support for policies to kill sharks. This study reports on two surveys of pride toward sharks from Eastern and Western Australia. These highlight a new and emerging story for people and sharks. We argue that the combination of shifts in the understanding of sharks' motives during human-shark interactions and higher levels of pride support a new political dynamic in which the public prefers nonlethal responses to shark bites in support of a burgeoning save the sharks movement.","[Pepin-Neff, Christopher; Wynter, Thomas] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Pepin-Neff, C (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Social Sci Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",christopher.neff@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,20,8,8,3,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1087-1209,1533-158X,,HUM DIMENS WILDL,Hum.

Fear can involve both acute and potential threats that can manifest in different behaviors and result from activity within different neural nodes and networks. Fear circuits have been studied extensively in animal models for several decades and in human neuroimaging research for almost 20 years. Therefore, the centrality of fear processing to PTSD lends the disorder to be more tractable to investigation at the level of brain and behavior, and provides several observable phenotypes that can be linked to PTSD symptoms. Moreover, psychophysiological metrics of fear conditioning offer tools that can be used to shift diagnostic paradigms in psychiatry toward neurobiologyconsistent with a Research Domain Criteria approach to PTSD. In general, mammalian fear processing can be divided into fear learning (or acquisition), during which an association develops between previously neutral stimuli and aversive outcomes, and fear extinction, in which the latter associations are suppressed by a new form of learning. This review describes translational research in both fear acquisition and extinction, along with their relevance to PTSD and PTSD treatment, focusing specifically on the empirical value and potential clinical utility of psychophysiological methods.","[Norrholm, Seth Davin; Jovanovic, Tanja] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Norrholm, Seth Davin] Atlanta VA Med Ctr, Mental Hlth Serv Line, Decatur, GA USA",,"Jovanovic, T (corresponding author), 49 Jesse Hill Jr Dr, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",tjovano@emory.edu,"Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022",,,,,155,33,34,2,23,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1067-3229,1465-7309,,HARVARD REV PSYCHIAT,Harv.

Recent nonhuman animal work suggests that BDNF is also crucial for amygdala-dependent associative learning. The present study sought to examine fear conditioning as a function of the BDNF polymorphism. Fifty-seven participants were genotyped for the BDNF polymorphism and took part in a differential-conditioning paradigm. Participants were shocked following a particular conditioned stimulus (CS+) and were also presented with stimuli that ranged in perceptual similarity to the CS+ (20, 40 or 60% smaller or larger than the CS+). The eye blink component of the startle response was measured to quantify fear conditioning; post-task shock likelihood ratings for each stimulus were also obtained. All participants reported that shock likelihood varied with perceptual similarity to the CS+ and showed potentiated startle in response to CS +/- 20% stimuli. However, only the Val/Val group had potentiated startle responses to the CS+. Met allele carrying individuals were characterized by deficient fear conditioning - evidenced by an attenuated startle response to CS+ stimuli. Variation in the BDNF genotype appears related to abnormal fear conditioning, consistent with nonhuman animal work on the importance of BDNF in amygdala-dependent associative learning. The relation between genetic variation in BDNF and amygdala-dependent associative learning deficits is discussed in terms of potential mechanisms of risk for psychopathology.","[Hajcak, G.; Castille, C.; Olvet, D.

This study aimed to determine whether emotional learning affects semantic representations of words independent of perceptual features by assessing whether fear conditioning to a neutral word generalises across languages in bilingual participants. Two sessions differing according to the reinforced language were performed by English-Spanish bilinguals. In each session, a neutral word was reinforced by an electrical shock whereas its equivalent in the other language was never paired with shock. Across two sessions within our sample, we found replicable evidence that fear conditioning consistently transferred to the non-reinforced language as measured by both self-reported fear and electrodermal activity, irrespective of the conditioned language. Our findings extend knowledge about the role of semantic similarity in fear generalisation and highlight the importance of higher-order cognitive processes in human emotions.","[Gregoire, Laurent; Greening, Steven G.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, CNAPs Lab, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,"Gregoire, L (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, CNAPs Lab, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",lgregoire1@lsu.edu; sgreening@lsu.edu,,"Gregoire, Laurent/0000-0002-3519-6395; Greening, Steven/0000-0003-4578-4139",Louisiana Board of Regents [LEQSF(2016-19)-RD-A-05],This work was supported by Louisiana Board of Regents: [Grant Number LEQSF(2016-19)-RD-A-05].,,26,11,11,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Reinstatement protocols involve unexpected (re)-presentations of the unconditioned stimulus (USs) after fear extinction training. Here, we address the number of reinstatement USs administered as a potential boundary condition that may explain divergent findings in the field. A sample of 171 participants is exposed to a fear acquisition training, immediate extinction training, and reinstatement test experiment. Three groups differing in the number of reinstatement US are employed: one (n = 57) or four (n = 55) in experimental groups and zero (n = 59) in the control group. We adopt Bayesian statistical approaches beyond classical null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to qualify evidence for or against this potential methodological boundary condition in reinstatement-induced return of fear. Startle potentiation to the reinstatement administration context was increased for the RI-USone compared to the RI-USzero group, supporting the role of context conditioning in reinstatement. This effect was weaker in the RI-USfour group. This, however, did not transfer to responding to conditioned stimuli during the return of fear-test: no evidence for an effect of the number of reinstatement USs (zero, one, four) was observed in behavioral or physiological measures. In sum, our results speak against the number of reinstatement USs as a potential boundary condition in experimentally induced return of fear in humans. This may challenge what we think we know about the reinstatement phenomenon in humans and call for critical reconsideration of paradigms as well as mechanisms that may underlie some reinstatement effects in the literature.","[Sjouwerman, Rachel; Lonsdorf, Tina B.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany",,"Lonsdorf, TB (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",t.lonsdorf@uke.de,,"Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [1980/2-1],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: 1980/2-1",,48,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,MAY,2020,57,5,,,,,,,e13549,10.1111/psyp.13549,,FEB 2020,15,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,LE7IY,WOS:000514178200001,32072648,hybrid,,,2022-03-23,

Recently, P50 suppression deficits were observed in patients with anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as we previously reported. The processes of fear conditioning are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. In addition, we found that the P50 sensory gating mechanism might be physiologically associated with fear conditioning and extinction in a simple human fear-conditioning paradigm that involved a light signal as a conditioned stimulus (CS+). Our objective was to investigate the different patterns of P50 suppression in a discrimination fear-conditioning paradigm with both a CS+ (danger signal) and a CS- (safety signal). Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited. We measured the auditory P50 suppression in the control (baseline) phase, in the fear-acquisition phase, and in the fear-extinction phase using a discrimination fear-conditioning paradigm. Two-way (CSs vs. phase) Analysis of variance with repeated measures demonstrated a significant interaction between the two factors. Post-hoc LSD analysis indicated that the P50 S2/S1 ratio in the CS+ acquisition phase was significantly higher than that in the CS- acquisition phase. These results suggest that the auditory P50 sensory gating might differ according to the cognition of the properties (potentially dangerous or safe) of the perceived signal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, efforts to quantify the effects of fear have primarily relied on experimentsthat replace predators with predator cues. Interpretation of these experiments must consider two important caveats: (1) the magnitude of experimenter-induced predator cues may not be realistically comparable to those of the prey's natural sensory environment, and (2) given functional predators are removed from the treatments, the fear effect is measured in the absence of any consumptive effects, a situation which never occurs in nature. We contend that demographic consequences of fear in natural populations may have been overestimated because the intensity of predator cues applied by experimenters in the majority of studies has been unnaturally high, in some instances rarely occurring in nature without consumption. Furthermore, the removal of consumption from the treatments creates the potential situation that individual prey in poor condition (those most likely to contribute strongly to the observed fear effects via starvation or reduced reproductive output) may have been consumed by predators in nature prior to the expression of fear effects, thus confounding consumptive and fear effects. Here, we describe an alternative treatment design that does not utilize predator cues, and in so doing, better quantifies the demographic effect of fear on wild populations. This treatment substitutes the traditional cue experiment where consumptive effects are eliminated and fear is simulated with a design where fear is removed and consumptive effects are simulated through the experimental removal of prey. Comparison to a natural population would give a more robust estimate of the effect of fear in the presence of consumption on the demographic variable of interest. This approach represents a critical advance in quantifying themechanistic pathways through which predation structures ecological communities. Discussing the merits of both treatments will motivate researchers to go beyond simply describing the existence of fear effects and focus on testing their true magnitude in wild populations and natural communities.","[Peers, Michael J.

The concept of servile fear and that of fear are separately used by them as signifying the unauthentic way of experiencing the world as home, while anxiety and clean fear are referred to as revealing the possibility of an authentic potentiality-of-being. They both argues that the servile fear or fear is unavoidable since we are always lost in the world.

This study examined the effects of feature learning on the acquisition and extinction of fear conditioning. Human participants were fear conditioned to a yellow triangle (CS+) using an electrical shock. We manipulated feature learning through differential conditioning. The nonconditioned control stimulus (CS-) was a red triangle in one group (Color-Relevant), but a yellow circle in the other group (Shape-Relevant). Next, two generalization stimuli were tested that shared the shape- or color-feature with the CS+ (a blue triangle and a yellow square). Online shock-expectancy ratings and skin conductance responding showed that the CS- determined the pattern of fear generalization: the same-color stimulus elicited more fear in Group Color-Relevant, versus the same-shape stimulus in group Shape-Relevant. Furthermore, extinguishing these two generalization stimuli had no detectable effect on fear of the CS+. These results show that fear generalization is influenced by feature learning through differential conditioning, and that exposures to different features of a stimulus are not sufficient to extinguish fear of that stimulus as a whole.

Studies in humans and animals indicate that predictable and unpredictable aversive events can induce phasic and sustained fear, respectively. Research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear. We explored this issue in humans by examining threat predictability in three virtual reality contexts, one in which electric shocks were predictably signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks occurred unpredictably but never paired with a cue, and a third in which no shocks were delivered. Evidence of threat-induced phasic and sustained fear was presented using fear ratings and skin conductance. Utilizing recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we were able to conduct whole-brain fMRI at relatively high spatial resolution and still have enough sensitivity to detect transient and sustained signal changes in the basal forebrain. We found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala, but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex. Consistent with animal models hypothesizing a role for the cortex in generating sustained fear, sustained signal increases to unpredictable threat were also found in anterior insula and a frontoparietal cortical network associated with hypervigilance. In addition, unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses. In line with basic findings in rodents, these results provide evidence that phasic and sustained fear in humans may manifest similar signs of distress, but appear to be associated with different patterns of neural activity in the human basal forebrain.

Women are at a higher risk for PTSD than men. Levels of circulating 17-beta estradiol (E2) in women have been linked to deficits in fear extinction and extinction recall. In PTSD, fear learning coincides with acute traumatic stress. However, little is known about the possible interaction between stress exposure and hormone status on fear acquisition and extinction learning. In a 2-day, 2 x 3 between-subjects design with healthy participants, we examined the effects of stress (psychosocial stressor vs. control, placed 45 min prior to conditioning) and natural E2-status on differential fear conditioning, covering fear acquisition, immediate extinction (Day 1), and 24 h-delayed extinction recall (Day 2). To operationalize E2-status, we compared women in the early follicular phase (EF) of their menstrual cycle (low E2, low progesterone plasma levels), women in the midcycle phase (MC, high E2, low progesterone), and men. Conditioning was indicated by differential skin conductance responses. We found an interaction between stress exposure and natural E2-status in women only: In MC-women, extinction recall on Day 2 (24h after initial extinction training) was better when fear acquisition had been preceded by stress. In EF-women, the inverse was true. We show that extinction recall of conditioned fear acquired after stress depends on estrogen status in women. Therefore, extinction-based exposure therapy in free-cycling female anxiety patients should take cycle status into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The bulk of the data suggest that the amygdala can be activated from potentially accessible but unattended fear stimuli. Activation of the amygdala facilitates low level visual processing. Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of the amygdala is mediated by a subcortical pathway. Thus, according to data from patients with lesions in the primary visual cortex, the amygdala can be activated in the absence of cortical processing. There is considerable support for the hypothesis that visual stimuli can access the amygdala via a pathway that includes the superior colliculus and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. These data are consistent with an evolutionary argument, focusing of the role of snakes as a predator on primates. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Fast learning serves to minimize the number of threat confrontations, while specific learning ensures that the acquired fears are tied to threat-relevant cues only. In Pavlovian fear conditioning, fear acquisition is typically studied via repetitive pairings of a single cue with an aversive experience, which is not optimal for the examination of fast specific fear learning. In this study, we adopted the one-trial overshadowing procedure from basic learning research, in which a combination of two visual cues is presented once and paired with an aversive electrical stimulation. Using on-line shock expectancy ratings, skin conductance reactivity and startle reflex modulation as indices of fear learning, we found evidence of strong fear after a single conditioning trial (fast learning) as well as attenuated fear responding when only half of the trained stimulus combination was presented (specific learning). Moreover, specificity of fear responding tended to correlate with levels of state and trait anxiety. These results suggest that one-trial overshadowing can be used as a model to study fast specific fear learning in humans and individual differences therein. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, fear conditioning has been proposed as an endophenotype for genetic studies of anxiety disorders. Although prior studies have demonstrated that fear conditioning and self-report fears are heritable, no studies have determined whether they share a common genetic basis. Methods: We obtained fear conditioning data from 173 twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry who also provided self-report ratings of 16 common fears. With multivariate structural equation modeling, we analyzed factor-derived scores for the subjective fear ratings together with the electrophysiologic skin conductance responses during habituation, acquisition, and extinction to determine the extent of their genetic covariation. Results: Phenotypic correlations between experimental and self-report fear measures were modest and, counter-intuitively, negative (i.e., subjects who reported themselves as more fearful had smaller electrophysiologic responses). Best-fit models estimated a significant (negative) genetic correlation between them, although genetic factors underlying fear conditioning accounted for only 9% of individual differences in self-report fears. Conclusions: Experimentally derived fear conditioning measures share only a small portion of the genetic factors underlying individual differences in subjective fears, cautioning against relying too heavily on the former as an endophenotype for genetic studies of phobic disorders.","[Hettema, John M.; Neale, Michael C.; Kendler, Kenneth S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Virginia Inst Psychiat & Behav Genet, Dept Psychiat, Richmond, VA 23298 USA; [Annas, Peter; Fredrikson, Mats] Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Uppsala, Sweden",,"Hettema, JM (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Virginia Inst Psychiat & Behav Genet, Dept Psychiat, POB 980126, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.",jhettema@vcu.edu,"Neale, Michael/AAD-5056-2020; Neale, Michael C/B-1418-2008; Kendler, Kenneth/AAF-2876-2019",,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K08 MH066277, K08 MH066277-05, MH-65322, K08 MH66277, R01 MH065322] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K08MH066277, R01MH065322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,47,9,10,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Across species, acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction, but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied. In rats, chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drug-free state. Here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans. Participants were healthy chronic cannabis users (n = 20) and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use (n = 20) matched on age, sex, and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders. A 2-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response. Consistent with hypotheses, chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced within-session extinction of skin conductance response on Day 1 (d = 0.78), and between-session extinction on Day 2 (d = 0.76). Unexpectedly, cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning. Replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of cannabis abstinence. General Scientific Summary Fear extinction provides a laboratory model to examine abnormal responses to stress. This study suggests that adults who regularly use marijuana have less capacity to extinguish previously conditioned fear responses compared to nonusing adults.","[Papini, Santiago; Powers, Mark B.; Smits, Jasper A.

We examined the effects of total sleep deprivation on subsequent enhancement of aversive event memory, implicit fear recognition, and fear conditioning in healthy humans. Methods: Three different recognitions (explicit event, implicit emotion, and physiological response) were assessed in two groups of 14 healthy young volunteers (sleep control and sleep deprived) with aversive (motor vehicle accident films) and nonaversive episodic memory stimuli. Both groups were tested on Day 1 of the experiment and again on Days 3 and 10; the sleep-deprived group was totally deprived of initial nocturnal sleep after the first trial on Day 1. Results: Event recognition performances were similar in both groups throughout the study. Implicit fear recognition remained high for aversive stimuli, with generalization of implicit fear recognition occurring for nonaversive stimuli on Day 3 in the sleep control group. Physiological fear and generalized fear responses were observed for every episode, and delayed enhancement of physiological response was only observed for misidentified aversive episodes in the sleep control group on Day 3. However, in the sleep-deprived group, generalization of implicit fear recognition for nonaversive stimuli on Day 3 and all physiological and generalized fear responses on Days 3 and 10 were comprehensively extinguished.

The research that is available has focused mostly on generalisation of peripheral and central physiological fear responses. Far less is known about the generalisation of avoidance, the behavioural component of fear. In two experiments, we evaluated how neuroticism, a known vulnerability factor for anxiety, modulates an array of fear responses, including avoidance tendencies, towards generalisation stimuli (GS). Participants underwent differential fear conditioning, in which one conditioned stimulus (CS+) was repeatedly paired with an aversive outcome (shock; unconditioned stimulus, US), whereas another was not (CS-). Fear generalisation was observed across measures in Experiment 1 (US expectancy and evaluative ratings) and Experiment 2 (US expectancy, evaluative ratings, skin conductance, startle responses, safety behaviours), with overall highest responding to the CS+, lowest to the CS- and intermediate responding to the GSs. Neuroticism had very little impact on fear generalisation (but did affect GS recognition rates in Experiment 1), in line with the idea that fear generalisation is largely an adaptive process.","[Arnaudova, Inna; Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis; Effting, Marieke; Kindt, Merel; Beckers, Tom] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Arnaudova, Inna; Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis; Effting, Marieke; Kindt, Merel; Beckers, Tom] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beckers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Beckers, T (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Beckers, T (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Beckers, T (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium.",tom.beckers@kuleuven.be,"Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis/ABD-1739-2020; Beckers, Tom/C-6164-2008","Krypotos, Angelos-Miltiadis/0000-0001-9704-6520; Beckers, Tom/0000-0002-9581-1505",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [452-09-001]; KU LeuvenKU Leuven [PF/10/005],The research reported here was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [Innovation Scheme (Vidi) grant number 452-09-001] and KU Leuven [grant number PF/10/005].,,43,9,9,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

In particular, the observed consequences of landscape changes for predator-prey interactions often lack a clear pattern, indicating a range of complex behavioral adaptations and interactions. One potentially important contributing factor shaping these consequences is perceived predation risk and hence fear, which is rarely explicitly addressed in studies on habitat modification. Objectives We investigated how fear changes prey community structures under habitat loss and fragmentation and identified habitat properties driving these changes. Methods We applied a spatially-explicit, individual-based model which simulates home range formation of a mammalian prey community based on food availability and perceived predation risk. With the model we predicted prey community structures under different landscape scenarios. Results Fear intensified the negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on prey communities, causing a non-proportional diversity loss of up to 30%. Shifts in community composition from large to small animals were reinforced. The highest prey diversity was supported in landscapes with non-fragmented safe areas. Our findings highlight the importance of fear in shaping prey community structures under conditions of landscape change. Conclusions Our modelling approach addresses the mechanisms that link individual space use with community structure. It reveals the key role played by the spatial distribution of safe patches in mitigating the negative effects of landscape changes. Thereby, it supports modern conservation efforts that go beyond single-species approaches by taking changes in community structure into account.","[Teckentrup, Lisa; Jeltsch, Florian] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Dept Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Jeltsch, Florian] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Ecol Dynam, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany",,"Teckentrup, L (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Dept Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Muhlenberg 3, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",teckentrup.lisa@gmail.com,"Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/A-8778-2013","Kramer-Schadt, Stephanie/0000-0002-9269-4446; Jeltsch, Florian/0000-0002-4670-6469",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG-GRK 2118/1],We thank Volker Grimm for comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Here, we explored people's landscapes of fear by investigating their perceptions of spatio-temporal variation in the risk of encountering wildlife, and how those perceptions influence their movement. We conducted a participatory risk mapping exercise with people living in the buffer zones of two protected areas in central India, which provide habitat to tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and numerous crop-raiding herbivores. We then tracked people's movement using GPS devices and explored how their movement related to their risk maps. Results of integrated step selection functions show that perceived risk influenced the speed and directedness with which people move, mixed evidence that perceived risk influenced where people went (habitat selection), and variation in how individuals responded to risks from different species. Future research on how humans and wildlife adapt to each other should investigate (1) human behavioral responses to wildlife over longer periods of time, (2) how movement affects the spatial patterns of human-wildlife conflict, and (3) the cultural and cognitive dimensions of how risk and emotions influence people's movement decisions.","[Read, Daniel J.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Habib, Bilal] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Stabach, Jared; Leimgruber, Peter] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Natl Zool Pk, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA",,"Read, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.",dread@umces.edu,"Leimgruber, Peter/O-1304-2015","Leimgruber, Peter/0000-0002-3682-0153; Stabach, Jared/0000-0002-7896-1237; Read, Daniel/0000-0001-6768-2753",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [201516684]; US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Internship Program,"This work was supported by a US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (Fellow ID: 201516684), and the US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Internship Program.",,88,0,0,7,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

A recent laboratory study suggested that novelty-facilitated extinction, a simple modification of standard extinction which involves presenting a novel non-aversive stimulus during extinction, prevents spontaneous recovery, one laboratory analogue of return of fear. The current study assessed whether novelty-facilitated extinction can also prevent reinstatement, a second laboratory analogue of return of fear. Following differential fear conditioning, one group of participants underwent standard extinction training whereas the second was presented with a novel tone after the conditional stimulus that previously predicted the aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Three presentations of the USs alone reinstated differential electrodermal fear responses after standard extinction, but not after novelty-facilitated extinction. Moreover, replicating previous findings, the extent of return of fear was correlated with self-reported intolerance of uncertainty after standard extinction, but not after novelty-facilitated extinction. These results support the proposal that novelty-facilitated extinction training can reduce the extent of return of fear.","[Lucas, Katherine; Luck, Camilla C.; Lipp, Ottmar V.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Luck, Camilla C.; Lipp, Ottmar V.] Univ Queensland, ARC SRI Sci Learning Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Lipp, OV (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",ottmar.lipp@curtin.edu.au,"Lipp, Ottmar V./A-1254-2007","Lipp, Ottmar V./0000-0001-6734-8608; Luck, Camilla/0000-0002-9364-1418","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP120100750, SR120300015]",This work was supported by grants number DP120100750 and SR120300015 from the Australian Research Council.,,31,26,26,2,18,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

Reacquisition measured by skin conductance responses was stronger in individuals that extinguished outside (6 h) than inside (10 min) the reconsolidation interval. However, the effect was predominantly present in val/val homozygotes of the functional val158met polymorphism of the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme and in short-allele carriers of the serotonin-transporter length 5-HTTLPR polymorphism.

A combination of behavioral and pharmacological interventions is used to ameliorate the behavioral signs associated with anxiety-related behaviors in dogs, but there continues to be need for effective interventions. The current study examined the effects of the nutraceutical ANXITANE (R) (L-Theanine) chewable tablets on fear of unfamiliar human beings. We first characterized clogs as anxious on the basis of the existence of a fear response to human beings in their home-pen. We then demonstrated that dogs characterized as anxious (N = 10) showed reduced interaction with an unknown human being as compared with normal controls (N = 7). The effect of an administration of ANXITANE tablets (N = 5) on these anxious Beagle dogs was compared with placebo (N = 5). Objective behavioral measures of anxiety were obtained using an open-field test, a human interaction test, and an actiwatch protocol that allowed monitoring of activity over 24-hours. The ANXITANE (R) tablets-treated dogs showed greater human interaction and approach than the placebo control group, and no side effects related to treatment, including motor stimulant or sedative effects, were seen. The current study suggests that ANXITANE (R) tablets are effective for reducing fearful behavior toward unfamiliar human beings in dogs and supports their use for treating anxiety-related behaviors.

A particularly important measure for the return of fear is reinstatement, but no human studies to date have examined the impact of estradiol on fear reinstatement. Forty-two healthy females completed a differential fear conditioning, extinction and reinstatement task with skin conductance response (SCR) amplitude indexing level of conditioned fear. Saliva samples were taken to measure estradiol and progesterone. To examine fear reinstatement, SCR amplitude was compared between the last trial of the late extinction phase to the first re-extinction trial following the unsignaled presentation of two aversive electric shocks. No significant effects of estradiol were found for acquisition of fear conditioning or fear extinction learning. Lower estradiol predicted a significantly larger generalized SCR amplitude at re-extinction (post-reinstatement) in women. This provides novel evidence suggesting a protective role of estradiol in potentially reducing the relapse of fear following re-exposure to aversive stimuli, although further research is necessary in clinical populations to clarify this effect.","[Felmingham, Kim L.; Caruana, Julia M.; Miller, Lisa N.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ney, Luke J.; Zuj, Daniel, V; Hsu, Chia Ming K.; Nicholson, Emma; To, Annie] Univ Tasmania, Sch Med, Div Psychol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Zuj, Daniel, V] Swansea Univ, Dept Psychol, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Bryant, Richard A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Felmingham, KL (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",kfelmingham@unimelb.edu.au,,"Ney, Luke/0000-0003-0209-8366",National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP 1073041],This work was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (APP 1073041) .,,52,1,1,3,5,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

This process is strongly dependent on successful memory formation and consolidation. Stimulation of the vagus nerve enhances memory formation in both animals and humans. The objective of this study was to assess whether transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve (tVNS) can accelerate extinction memory formation and retention in fear conditioned humans. To assess fear conditioning and subsequent fear extinction, we assessed US expectancy ratings, fear potentiated startle responses and phasic heart rate responses. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in thirty-one healthy participants. After fear conditioning participants were randomly assigned to receive tVNS or sham stimulation during the extinction phase. Retention of extinction memory was tested 24 h later. tVNS accelerated explicit fear extinction learning (US expectancy ratings), but did not lead to better retention of extinction memory 24 h later. We did not find a differential physiological conditioning response during the acquisition of fear and thus were unable to assess potential effects of tVNS on the extinction of physiological indices of fear. These findings complement recent studies that suggest vagus nerve stimulation could be a promising tool to improve memory consolidation and fear extinction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is also widely regarded as a model for the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders in a diathesis-stress model of psychopathology. Starting from the apparent paradox between the adaptive nature of fear conditioning and the dysfunctional nature of pathological anxiety, we present a critique of the human fear conditioning paradigm as an experimental model for psychopathology. We discuss the potential benefits of expanding the human fear conditioning paradigm by (1) including action tendencies as an important index of fear and (2) paying more attention to weak (i.e., ambiguous) rather than strong fear learning situations (Lissek et al., 2006), such as contained in selective learning procedures. We present preliminary data that illustrate these ideas and discuss the importance of response systems divergence in understanding individual differences in vulnerability for the development of pathological anxiety.

Three hundred and sixty-eight healthy volunteers participated in a differential fear conditioning paradigm with circles of different sizes as conditioned stimuli (CS), of which one was paired to an aversive LAPS picture. During generalization, each subject was presented with one of 10 different sized circles including the CSs, and were asked to categorize the stimulus as either a CS or as novel after fear responses were recorded. Linear mixed models were used to investigate differences in fear generalization gradients depending on the participant's perception of the test stimulus. We found that the incorrect perception of a novel stimulus as the initial fear-evoking stimulus strongly boosted fear responses. The current findings demonstrate that a significant number of novel stimuli used to assess generalization are incorrectly identified as the initial fear-evoking stimulus, providing a perceptual account for the observed overgeneralization in panic and anxiety disorders. Accordingly, enhancing perceptual processing may be a promising treatment for targeting excessive fear generalization. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Since then, fear incubation has been demonstrated in both humans and nonhumans. However, the difficulty of demonstrating long-lasting fear incubation in rodents has hampered the study of the underlying mechanisms of this incubation. Here, we describe a rat procedure where fear reliably incubates over time. Methods: We trained food-restricted rats to lever-press for food pellets in daily 90-min sessions. We then gave each rat 100 30-sec tones co-terminating with a.5-sec.5-mA footshock over 10 days (10 pairings/day). Groups of rats (n = 10-15) were then given four presentations of the tone (the fear cue) 2, 15, 31, or 61 days after fear conditioning training and were assessed for conditioned suppression of lever-pressing. Results: We found that conditioned fear responses were significantly higher 31 and 61 days after fear training than after 2 or 15 days. In control experiments, we showed that extensive tone-shock pairing is necessary for the emergence of fear incubation and that it is unlikely that non-associative factors contribute to this incubation. Conclusions: We describe a procedure for generating reliable and long-lasting conditioned fear incubation. Our procedure can be used to study mechanisms of fear incubation and might provide a model for studying the mechanisms of delayed-onset posttraumatic stress disorder that occur in a sub-population of people previously exposed to chronic stressors.","[Pickens, Charles L.; Golden, Sam A.; Adams-Deutsch, Tristan; Nair, Sunila G.; Shaham, Yavin] NIDA, Behav Neurosci Branch, Intramural Res Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA",,"Shaham, Y (corresponding author), NIDA, Behav Neurosci Branch, Intramural Res Program, NIH,Dept Hlth & Human Serv, 251 Bayview Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",yshaham@intra.nida.nih.gov,"Pickens, Charles L/E-8984-2010; Nair, Sunila/AAW-7600-2020; shaham, yavin/G-1306-2014","Pickens, Charles/0000-0003-3485-949X; Golden, Sam/0000-0002-2104-2272",National Institute on Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission; Intramural Research Program; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [ZIADA000434] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program.

We studied the effect of BDNFval66met in an aversive differential fear conditioning, and a delayed extinction paradigm in 57 healthy participants. Pictures of male faces were used as stimuli and fear learning was quantified by fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance responses (SCR). Aware BDNF met-carriers show a deficit in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning as indicated by an absence of FPS responses in the last acquisition block. This deficit was maintained in the first block of extinction. No genotype differences were found in conditioned SCR discrimination.

In contrast, the overgeneralization of fear is maladaptive and is a hallmark of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric illness that is characterized by chronic symptomatology and a higher incidence in women compared to men. Therefore, understanding the neural basis of fear generalization at remote time-points in female animals is of particular translational relevance. However, our understanding of the neurobiology of fear generalization is largely restricted to studies employing male mice and focusing on recent time-points (i.e., within 24-48 h following conditioning). To address these limitations, we examined how male and female mice generalize contextual fear at remote time intervals (i.e., 3 weeks after conditioning). In agreement with earlier studies of fear generalization at proximal time-points, we find that the test order of training and generalization contexts is a critical determinant of generalization and context discrimination, particularly for female mice. However, tactile elements that are present during fear conditioning are more salient for male mice. Our study highlights long-term sex differences in defensive behavior between male and female mice and may provide insight into sex differences in the processing and retrieval of remote fear memory observed in humans.","[Asok, Arun; Hijazi, Joud; Harvey, Lucas R.; Kosmidis, Stylianos; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Asok, Arun; Hijazi, Joud; Harvey, Lucas R.; Kosmidis, Stylianos; Kandel, Eric R.; Rayman, Joseph B.] Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, Howard Hughes Med Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Kandel, Eric R.] Columbia Univ, Kavli Inst Brain Sci, New York, NY USA",,"Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Neurosci, Jerome L Greene Sci Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Rayman, JB (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jbr2114@columbia.edu,,"Kosmidis, Stylianos/0000-0002-3534-5637",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [1F32-MH114306]; Cohen Veterans Bioscience; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH114306] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We are grateful for the support from the National Institute of Mental Health 1F32-MH114306 (AA), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (EK), and Cohen Veterans Bioscience (JR and EK).",,76,6,6,1,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Parental care is arguably what most distinguishes birds and mammals from other taxa, yet only one experiment on wildlife has tested fear effects on parental food provisioning and the repercussions this has for the survival of dependent offspring, and only during early-stage care. We tested the effect of fear on late-stage parental care of mobile dependent offspring, by locating radio-tagged Song Sparrow fledglings and broadcasting predator or non-predator playbacks in their vicinity, measuring their parent's behavior and their own, and tracking the offspring's survival to independence. Fear significantly reduced late-stage parental care, and parental fearfulness (as indexed by their reduction in provisioning when hearing predators) significantly predicted their offspring's condition and survival. Combining results from this experiment with that on early-stage care, we project that fear itself is powerful enough to reduce late-stage survival by 24%, and cumulatively reduce the number of young reaching independence by more than half, 53%. Experiments in invertebrate and aquatic systems demonstrate that fear is commonly as important as direct killing in affecting prey demography, and we suggest focusing more on fear effects and on offspring survival will reveal the same for wildlife.","[Dudeck, Blair P.; Clinchy, Michael; Allen, Marek C.; Zanette, Liana Y.] Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Zanette, LY (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",lzanette@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Thanks to E.

Overall, the results suggest that instructed extinction reduces conditional fear responding and facilitates extinction learning, except when conditional stimulus valence is assessed as an index of fear or when fear is conditioned to images of animal fear-relevant stimuli (snakes and spiders) or with a very intense US. These exceptions highlight potential boundary conditions for the reliance on cognitive interventions when treating fear in clinical settings.","[Luck, Camilla C.; Lipp, Ottmar V.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Luck, Camilla C.; Lipp, Ottmar V.] ARC SRI Sci Learning Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Luck, CC (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",c.luck@curtin.edu.au,"Lipp, Ottmar V./A-1254-2007","Lipp, Ottmar V./0000-0001-6734-8608; Luck, Camilla/0000-0002-9364-1418","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP120100750, SR120300015]",This work was supported by grants number DP120100750 and SR120300015 from the Australian Research Council.,,59,24,25,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9530,1742-9536,,AUST J PSYCHOL,Aust.

Using more potent amnestic drugs, post-reactivation amnesia has been shown in animals to be reversible by re-administration of the drug prior to memory retention testing. The latter finding suggests that, at least under some circumstances, post-reactivation amnesia may not reflect a disruption of reconsolidation (i.e., a memory storage deficit) but an acquired state-dependency of memory expression (i.e., a memory retrieval deficit that is relieved when the drug state is recreated during testing). We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate whether the previously established amnestic effects of post-reactivation propranolol administration on memory retention in humans may similarly reflect a retrieval deficit. In four groups of participants, fear memories were first established through differential fear conditioning. One day later, a single presentation of the CS+ without shock was used to reactivate the memory in three of the four groups, followed by the administration of 40 mg Propranolol HCl (Groups PrPI and PrPr) or placebo (Group PIPI). Memory was not reactivated in the fourth group (Group NR). Another 24 h later, Propranolol HCl (Group PrPr) or placebo (Groups PrPI, PIPI, and NR) was again administered, followed by a test of memory retention (extinction testing) and recovery (reinstatement testing). We did not observe any effects of post-reactivation propranolol on memory retention; conditioned responding was similar for all groups at the start of retention testing and similarly sensitive to recovery through reinstatement. We did observe an acute effect of propranolol administration on fear-potentiated startle responding during retention testing in Group PrPr, where participants exhibited attenuated startle responses during extinction testing but similar sensitivity to reinstatement as participants in the other groups. While our findings fail to corroborate previous reports of propranolol-induced post-reactivation amnesia in humans, they do point to acute effects of propranolol administration on extinction performance.","[Chalkia, Anastasia; Beckers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Chalkia, Anastasia; Van Oudenhove, Lukas; Beckers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Brain Inst, Leuven, Belgium; [Weermeijer, Jeroen] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Contextual Psychiat, Dept Neurosci, Leuven, Belgium; [Van Oudenhove, Lukas] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Brain Gut Axis Studies, Translat Res Ctr Gastrointestinal Disorders, Dept Chron Dis Metab & Ageing, Leuven, Belgium",,"Beckers, T (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium.; Beckers, T (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven Brain Inst, Leuven, Belgium.",tom.beckers@kuleuven.be,"Beckers, Tom/C-6164-2008; Chalkia, Anastasia/AAL-5989-2020","Beckers, Tom/0000-0002-9581-1505; Chalkia, Anastasia/0000-0002-1613-2281; Van Oudenhove, Lukas/0000-0002-6540-3113","European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [648176]; Hercules Foundation, Belgium [AKUL/13/07, AKUL/11/08]","This work was funded by Consolidator Grant 648176 of the European Research Council (ERC) awarded to TB.

One way to empirically evaluate the external validity of fear conditioning is by prospective studies. We review available prospective research investigating whether individual performance in fear conditioning predicts individual differences in anxiety levels and exposure-based treatment outcome. We focus on fear extinction, generalization, acquisition, and avoidance. Results suggest that reduced extinction and broader generalization predict higher anxiety levels. Results with respect to the predictive value of acquisition for anxiety levels are mixed. With regard to predicting exposurebased treatment outcome, some studies do find an association with extinction whereas others do not. The majority of studies does not find an association with acquisition. Evidence on extinction recall is limited and not consistent. The interpretation of these results requires caution. The number of available studies is limited. It is possible that not all work, in particular studies with only null effects, has found its way to publication. Future research on this topic will benefit from large sample sizes, preregistered hypotheses, full transparency about the conducted analyses and the publication of high-quality studies with null effects.","[Scheveneels, Sara; Boddez, Yannick; Hermans, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium",,"Scheveneels, S (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Ctr Learning Psychol & Expt Psychopathol, Tiensestr 102,Bus 3712, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",Sara.scheveneels@kuleuven.be,,"Scheveneels, Sara/0000-0003-1931-5777; Hermans, Dirk/0000-0003-4497-3982", [KU Leuven C1];  [C16/19/02];  [BOF16/MET_V/002],This work was funded by a KU Leuven C1 project (C16/19/02) awarded to Dirk Hermans.

Recently, P50 suppression deficits were found in patients with anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The processes of fear conditioning are thought to play roles in pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether sensory gating would be physiologically altered by fear conditioning. Methods: To clarify the relationship between classical fear conditioning and the sensory gating mechanism, we measured changes of P50 and N100 suppression of 21 healthy volunteers in control (baseline) phase, in fear acquisition phase, and in fear extinction phase. Results: The mean P50 S2/S1 ratio in fear acquisition phase was significantly elevated in comparison with that in control phase, and it recovered into basal level in extinction phase. In contrast, the mean N100 S2/S1 ratio showed no changes through all phases from fear acquisition to extinction. Conclusions: These results suggest that the P50 but not N100 sensory gating mechanism might be physiologically associated with fear acquisition and extinction.","[Kurayama, Taichi; Nakazawa, Ken; Matsuzawa, Daisuke; Yoshida, Susumu; Nanbu, Makoto; Suto, Chihiro; Shimizu, Eiji] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Integrat Neurophysiol, Chiba 2608670, Japan; [Shimizu, Eiji] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Ctr Prevent Med Sci, Chiba 2608670, Japan",,"Shimizu, E (corresponding author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Integrat Neurophysiol, Inohana 1-8-1, Chiba 2608670, Japan.",eiji@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Shimizu, Eiji/K-4637-2017; Kurayama, Taichi/V-8171-2019","Shimizu, Eiji/0000-0002-6741-9338; Matsuzawa, Daisuke/0000-0003-0408-2608; Sutoh, Chihiro/0000-0002-5191-8220",,,,47,7,8,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

This idea is embodied in exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders, where the intent of exposure is to reverse a history of avoidant behavior that is thought to fuel a patient's irrational fears. We tested in humans the relationship between fear and avoidance by combining Pavlovian differential fear conditioning with a novel task for quantifying spontaneous passive avoidant behavior. During self-guided navigation in virtual reality following de novo fear conditioning, we observed participants keeping their distance from the feared object. At the individual level, passive avoidant behavior was highly associated with maladaptive fear expression (fear-potentiated startle) during late extinction training, indicating that extinction learning was impaired following a brief episode of avoidance. Avoidant behavior, however, was not related to initial acquired fear, raising doubt about a straightforward link between physiological fear and behavioral avoidance. We conclude that a deeper understanding of what motivates avoidance may offer a target for early intervention, before fears transition from the rational to the irrational.","[Cornwell, Brian R.; Overstreet, Cassie; Krimsky, Marissa; Grillon, Christian] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Cornwell, Brian R.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Life & Social Sci, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",,"Cornwell, BR (corresponding author), NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",bcornwell@swin.edu.au,,,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [T32MH020030, ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Daniel Pine, Katherine Vytal, and Oliver Robinson for helpful comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

The amygdala is vital for the association of cues and fear expression, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for fear regulation after extinction. The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) has an extensive connection with the fear circuit. In human studies, emotional regulation disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are often linked to an abnormality in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Therefore, in a series of experiments, we examined whether abnormal mOFC activities interfere with the regulation of learned fear. The mOFC of rats was pharmacologically activated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) during the acquisition, early consolidation, or retrieval phase of fear extinction. Under mOFC activation, there was a general initial suppression of the fear response followed by the development of nonspecific fear expression. Moreover, pre-extinction activation of the mOFC abolished extinction acquisition, causing an up-shift in the fear response during the retrieval test. Nonetheless, immediate post-extinction activation of the mOFC did not interfere with extinction consolidation. Overall, our results suggested that mOFC activation abolished fear extinction acquisition and interfered with fear expression.","[Hsieh, Hsin-Ti; Chang, Chun-hui] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Syst Neurosci, Kuang Fu Rd,Sec 2,101, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",,"Chang, CH (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Syst Neurosci, Kuang Fu Rd,Sec 2,101, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",changch@life.nthu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan MOST [106-2320-B-007-006-MY3]","This work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan MOST 106-2320-B-007-006-MY3 to CHC.

It contends that properly understanding the ethical dimensions of such uses of fear depends in part on a clear understanding of the dynamics of disorientation that can be involved in such uses. Section two begins with a clarification of the connections between fear, orientation, and disorientation. It suggests that experiences of fear are in some cases either orienting or disorienting, and that the disorienting aspects of fear are in need of more attention. Section three shows how experiences of fear can be tools-they can be cultivated and wielded by agents deliberately for multiple reasons, including sometimes in order to disorient or re-orient others. Section four turns to a moral evaluation of these uses of fear, attending specifically to why the dynamics of disorientation and orientation often involved in experiences of fear are important for understanding the moral status of uses of fear.","[Harbin, Ami] Oakland Univ, Dept Philosophy, Rochester, MI 48309 USA",,"Harbin, A (corresponding author), Oakland Univ, Dept Philosophy, Rochester, MI 48309 USA.",aharbin@oakland.edu,,,,,,25,2,2,1,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2820,1572-8447,,ETHICAL THEORY MORAL,Ethical Theory Moral Pract.,AUG,2020,23,3-4,,,SI,,501,513,,10.1007/s10677-020-10103-1,,JUL 2020,13,Philosophy,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Philosophy,NL5WI,WOS:000548831100001,32837255,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2022-03-23,

We hypothesized that if we presented fear-scented sweat to our canine seizure scent detection team, and they identified the fear scent as their seizure scent, then that would suggest that they are identical compounds. Methods: Following consent and approval, sweat samples taken from volunteers associated with the Brooke Gordon Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at Denver Health were processed by the Canine Assistants (CA) service dog team that had been imprinted to recognize the unique seizure scent from our previous study. In part one, sweat samples were collected from subjects, who had no prior history of epilepsy or seizures, under two different testing environments: watching a scary movie (It) and a neutral/comedy movie (Airplane!). In part two, a larger follow-up study utilizing fear sweat, exercise sweat, epilepsy sweat, and other distractor scents were provided in a multiple choice paradigm to better understand the inter-rater reliability of the canine responses. Results: In part one, our canine seizure scent detection team identified fear-scented sweat samples as their seizure scent in 4 of 5 study participants. There was almost perfect agreement of seizure scent detection during fear scent trials between the canine seizure scent detectors with a kappa value of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.668-0.960). In part two, (utilizing eleven different subjects) our canine scent detection team identified samples of either fear or seizure sweat with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 100% (no false positives) from among the multiple choices offered. Additionally, there was 92% agreement between the members of the canine scent detection team. Significance: While this hypothesis testing study is small and deserves replication, it confirms that the Canine Assistants seizure scent detection team consistently and accurately identified fear-scented sweat as their seizure scent, implying that the VOC, menthone, is common to both conditions. This further implies that human seizure propagation and fear network circuitry may share a common anatomy, and that menthone may not only be an early seizure biomarker, but a newly described human alarm pheromone.

Yet, a number of studies using Pavlovian cued fear conditioning have been unable to demonstrate an effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on acquisition or retention of fear conditioning. Evidence for the involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors in emotional memories comes mostly from studies using fear inhibitory avoidance in rodents. It is possible that fear inhibitory avoidance is more akin to contextual conditioning than to cued fear conditioning, suggesting that context conditioning may be disrupted by beta-adrenergic blockade. Objective: This study investigated the effects of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol on cued and contextual fear conditioning in humans. Methods: Subjects were given either placebo (n=15) or 40 mg propranolol (n=15) prior to differential cued conditioning. A week later, they were tested for retention of context and cued fear conditioning using physiological (startle reflex and electrodermal activity) and subjective measures of emotional arousal. Results: The results were consistent with the hypothesis. The skin conductance level (SCL) and the subjective measure of arousal suggested reduced emotional arousal upon returning to the conditioning context in the propranolol group, compared to the placebo group. The acquisition and retention of cued fear conditioning were not affected by propranolol. Conclusions: These results suggest that beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in contextual fear conditioning.","NIMH, Mood Anxiety Disorder Program, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Connecticut VA Med Ctr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Mood Anxiety Disorder Program, NIH, DHHS, 15K North Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",christian.grillon@nih.gov,,,"NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 47840, MH 59906, MH 57250, MH 52384] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R37MH047840, R01MH047840, R01MH059906, R01MH057250, P50MH052384] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,46,81,81,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,SEP,2004,175,3,,,,,342,352,,10.1007/s00213-004-1819-5,,,11,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,862YI,WOS:000224527000009,15007536,,,,2022-03-23,

At present it is debated whether different types of fear memories are differentially sensitive to behavioral manipulations of reconsolidation. Here, we examined post-reconsolidation recovery of fear as a function of conditioned stimulus (CS) fear-relevance, using the unconditioned stimulus (US) to reactivate and destabilize conditioned fear memories. Participants (N = 56; 25 male; M = 24.39 years, SD = 7.71) in the US-reactivation and control group underwent differential fear conditioning to fear-relevant (spiders/snakes) and fear-irrelevant (geometric shapes) CSs on Day 1. On Day 2, participants received either reminded (US -reactivation) or non-reminded extinction training. Tests of fear recovery, conducted 24 h later, revealed recovery of differential electrodermal responding to both classes of CSs in the control group, but not in the US -reactivation group. These findings indicate that the US reactivation extinction procedure eliminated recovery of extinguished responding not only to fear-irrelevant, but also to fear-relevant CSs. Contrasting previous reports, our findings show that post-reconsolidation recovery of conditioned responding is not a function of CS fear-relevance and that persistent reduction of fear, conditioned to fear-relevant CSs, can be achieved through behavioral manipulations of reconsolidation.

Animal studies suggest that the neural circuitry responsible fear renewal includes the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsomedial (dmPFC) and ventromedial (vmPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, the neural mechanisms of context-dependent fear renewal in humans remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), combined with psychophysiology and immersive virtual reality, to elucidate how the hippocampus, amygdala, and dmPFC and vmPFC interact to drive the context-dependent renewal of extinguished fear. Healthy human participants encountered dynamic fear-relevant conditioned stimuli (CSs) while navigating through 3-D virtual reality environments in the MRI scanner. Conditioning and extinction were performed in two different virtual contexts. Twenty-four hours later, participants were exposed to the CSs without reinforcement while navigating through both contexts in the MRI scanner. Participants showed enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs) to the previously-reinforced CS + in the acquisition context on Day 2, consistent with fear renewal, and sustained responses in the dmPFC. In contrast, participants showed low SCRs to the CSs in the extinction context on Day 2, consistent with extinction recall, and enhanced vmPFC activation to the non-reinforced CS -. Structural equation modeling revealed that the dmPFC fully mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during fear renewal, whereas the vmPFC partially mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during extinction recall. These results indicate dissociable contextual influences of the hippocampus on prefrontal pathways, which, in turn, determine the level of reactivation of fear associations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, it has not been sufficiently examined whether other arthropods similarly elicit fear or disgust. Our aim was to examine if all arthropods are rated similarly, if only potentially dangerous arthropods (spiders, bees/wasps) elicit comparable responses, or if spiders are rated in a unique way. We presented pictures of arthropods (15 spiders, 15 beetles, 15 bees/wasps, and 15 butterflies/moths) to 76 students who rated each picture for fear, disgust, and how dangerous they thought the animal is. They also categorized each animal into one of the four animal groups. In addition, we assessed the participants' fear of spiders and estimates for trait anxiety. The ratings showed that spiders elicit significantly greater fear and disgust than any other arthropod group, and spiders were rated as more dangerous. Fear and disgust ratings of spider pictures significantly predicted the questionnaire scores for fear of spiders, whereas dangerousness ratings of spiders and ratings of other arthropods do not provide any predictive power. Thus, spider fear is in fact spider specific. Our results demonstrate that potential harmfulness alone cannot explain why spiders are feared so frequently. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but still, the contribution of sleep deprivation on the susceptibility to PTSD has received little attention. To determine whether rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (SD) alters the development of fear expression or fear-associated memory impairment in adolescent rats, we performed animal emotional behavior tests using an SD animal model with the flowerpot technique. SD rats showed an increase in locomotor activity frequency and a decrease in sucrose consumption compared to control rats. An increase in freezing behavior during shock trials was observed in SD rats. Noticeably, it was observed that when applying the SD condition after fear stimuli exposure, fear extinction was delayed more in SD rats than in control rats. Overall, these results indicate that SD in adolescent rats leads to increased locomotor activity and anhedonic behavior, as well as increased fear expression and delayed fear extinction, suggesting that SD would lead to increased severity of PTSD-like phenotype.","[Jung, Taesub; Noh, Jihyun] Dankook Univ, Dept Sci Educ, 152 Jukjeon Ro, Yongin 16890, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",,"Noh, J (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Dept Sci Educ, 152 Jukjeon Ro, Yongin 16890, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",jihyun2@dankook.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A2A01026454],This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [grant number NRF-2017S1A5A2A01026454].,,68,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-8354,2151-2485,,ANIM CELLS SYST,Anim.

Fear can be innate or learned. Examples of innate fear include fears that are triggered by predators, pain, heights, rapidly approaching objects, and ancestral threats such as snakes and spiders. Animals and humans detect and respond more rapidly to threatening stimuli than to nonthreatening stimuli in the natural world. The threatening stimuli for most animals are predators, and most predators are themselves prey to other animals. Predatory avoidance is of crucial importance for survival of animals. Although humans are rarely affected by predators, we are constantly challenged by social threats such as a fearful or angry facial expression.

Fear return is sensitive to HPC high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in rats. The goal of the present study was to examine whether fear learning sensitization is also sensitive to HPC HFS in rats. We found in control conditions that, after FC1 (with 15 shock administrations) and extinction, conditioning in a different context with one shock administration was potentiated (proactive effect) and associated with fear return in the initial context (retroactive effect). Both phenomena were prevented by HPC HFS applied before the second conditioning. We also found that the effect of HPC HFS on fear learning sensitization required initial extinction. These findings suggest a pivotal role of the HPC in preventing proactive and retroactive effects of successive fear conditionings. These data also support the concept that HPC deactivation may be involved in fear learning sensitization and fear return in PTSD patients. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is important to determine whether observed deficits are reflective of a memory impairment or whether they are simply attributable to a deficit in the performance of unconditioned fear responses such as freezing. Within the neurobiology of learning and memory literature, there is an ongoing debate concerning the potential role of the amygdala in the performance of unconditioned fear responses. A view put forth by Vazdarjanova and McGaugh (1998) suggests that the amygdala is not required for the formation and consolidation of the aversive memories formed during fear conditioning, but is essential in the performance of unconditioned fear responses. Data provided by Maren (1999) counter this view by positing that the amygdala is not required for the performance of fear responses, but its role is of a mnemonic nature in the conditioning of fear to neutral cues. To clarify the amygdala's participation in these two processes, a useful approach would involve a situation where animals with amygdala damage were examined for their unconditioned fear responses in reaction to footshock as well as the conditioning of these reactions to previously neutral cues paired with the aversive event. We have previously reported that rats with amygdala or hippocampal damage are impaired in discriminative fear conditioning to context. In the present experiment, we report the initial unconditioned fear responses to footshock by these same animals as well as the conditioned responses during testing. In both groups, the fear responses assessed (freezing, urination, defecation, and locomotion) were not impaired and did not differ from those expressed by the sham animals. The impairment of discriminative fear conditioning to context, in combination with the present experiment, represents a dissociation where damage to specific memory structures (amygdala or hippocampus) debilitates the mnemonic processes involved in fear conditioning, but not the performance of the fear responses per se.","Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",,"Antoniadis, EA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",elena@psych.utoronto.ca,,,,,,38,39,41,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0014-4819,1432-1106,,EXP BRAIN RES,Exp.

Sleep promotes both the consolidation of memory and the regulation of emotion. Sleep can influence consolidation and modification of memories associated with both fear and its extinction. After brief overviews of the behavior and neural circuitry associated with fear conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction memory in the rodent and human, interactions of sleep with these processes will be examined. Animal and human studies suggest that sleep can serve to consolidate both fear and extinction memory. In humans, sleep also promotes generalization of extinction memory. Time-of-day effects on extinction learning and generalization are also seen. Rapid eye movement (REM) may be a sleep stage of particular importance for the consolidation of both fear and extinction memory as evidenced by selective REM deprivation experiments. REM sleep is accompanied by selective activation of the same limbic structures implicated in the learning and memory of fear and extinction. Preliminary evidence also suggests extinction learning can take place during slow wave sleep. Study of low-level processes such as conditioning, extinction, and habituation may allow sleep effects on emotional memory to be identified and inform study of sleep's effects on more complex, emotionally salient declarative memories. Anxiety disorders are marked by impairments of both sleep and extinction memory. Improving sleep quality may ameliorate anxiety disorders by strengthening naturally acquired extinction. Strategically timed sleep may be used to enhance treatment of anxiety by strengthening therapeutic extinction learned via exposure therapy.","[Pace-Schott, Edward F.; Milad, Mohammed R.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Pace-Schott, Edward F.; Milad, Mohammed R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Charlestown, MA USA; [Germain, Anne] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",,"Pace-Schott, EF (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp E, CNY 149 13th St Room 2624, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",epace-schott@mgh.harvard.edu,"Milad, Mohammed R/O-4553-2018",," [MH090357];  [USAMRAA Log11293006];  [MH097965]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH097965, R21MH090357, R01MH097964] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Research supported by MH090357, USAMRAA Log11293006, MH097965.

Accordingly, variance in SERT functioning appears to constitute an important pathway to individual differences in anxiety. The current study tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in SERT function is associated with variability in the basic reflex physiology of defense. Healthy subjects (N = 82) were presented with clearly instructed cues of shock threat and safety to induce robust anxiety reactions. Subjects carrying at least one short allele for the 5-HITLPR polymorphism showed stronger fear-potentiated startle compared to long allele homozygotes. However, short allele carriers showed no deficit in the downregulation of fear after the offset of threat. These results suggest that natural variation in SERT function affects the magnitude of defensive reactions while not affecting the capacity for fear regulation.

It causes individuals to take actions and make choices that help them face the threat, such as by seeking out others because there is strength in numbers. We conjecture that fear also increases materialism in individuals because there is strength in things. The results from four experiments illustrate that situationally felt fear can increase materialistic orientation (Study 1) because of a desire for safety (Study 2). Importantly, fear increases preference for material and not experiential goods (Study 3). Finally, consistent with our theoretical account, having more material products (vs. experiences) can reduce fear (Study 4). Together, our findings across four studies suggest that fear increases materialism. Our findings also offer unique insights into another precursor or antecedent to materialism, a human value related to both possessiveness and selfishness and that restricts individuals' pursuit of true happiness.","[Longmire, Sierra J.; Chan, Eugene Y.; Lawry, C.

LY354740, a structural analogue of glutamate that shows specificity at the mGluR2/3 receptor, has anxiolytic effects in animal models. Objective. This study investigated the anxiolytic effects of LY354740 in humans using the fear-potentiated startle reflex methodology. Methods. Subjects were given either placebo (n=16), 20 mg LY354740 (n=15), or 200 mg LY354740 (n=13). The fear-potentiated startle tests examined startle potentiation to shock anticipation and to darkness. Results. Consistent with previous results, startle was increased by threat of shock and by darkness. LY354740 did not affect baseline startle. Correspondingly, subjects did not report LY354740 to be sedative. LY354740 significantly reduced the increase in startle magnitude during shock anticipation, but not during darkness. Subjective reports of state anxiety and negative affectivity during the fear-potentiated startle tests were also reduced in a dose-dependent manner by LY354740. Conclusions. These results suggest that LY354740 has an anxiolytic profile in humans without being sedative.","NIMH, NIH, DHHS, Mood & Anxiety Disorder Program, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Vet Adm Med Ctr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Lilly Res Labs, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, NIH, DHHS, Mood & Anxiety Disorder Program, 15k North Dr,Msc 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,,,,,,46,157,159,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,AUG,2003,168,4,,,,,446,454,,10.1007/s00213-003-1444-8,,,9,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,711TA,WOS:000184756100009,12709777,Green Submitted,,,2022-03-23,

Whether these structures perform similar functions in humans is unknown. On both simple and conditional discrimination tasks, unilateral temporal lobectomy subjects showed impaired conditioned response acquisition relative to control subjects. This impairment could not be accounted for by deficits in nonassociative sensory or autonomic performance factors, or by differences in declarative memory for the experimental parameters.

Exposure to a live cat induces striking activation in the rostrodorsal and caudal ventral PAG. In the present investigation, we first showed that cytotoxic lesions of the rostrodorsal and caudal ventral PAG had similar effects on innate fear responses during cat exposure, practically abolishing freezing and increasing risk assessment responses. Conversely, rostrodorsal PAG lesions but not caudal ventral lesions disrupted learned contextual fear responses to cat exposure. Next, we examined how muscimol inactivation of the rostrodorsal PAG at different times (i.e., during, immediately after and 20min after cat exposure) influences learned contextual fear responses, and we found that inactivation of the rostrodorsal PAG during or immediately after cat exposure but not 20min later impaired contextual fear learning. Thus, suggesting that the rostrodorsal PAG is involved in the acquisition, but not the consolidation, of contextual fear memory to predatory threat. Notably, the dosolateral PAG contains a distinct population of neurons containing the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) enzyme, and in the last experiment, we investigated how nitric oxide released in rostrodorsal PAG influences contextual fear memory processing. Accordingly, injection of a selective nNOS inhibitor into the rostrodorsal PAG immediately after cat exposure disrupted learned contextual responses. Overall, the present findings suggest that the acquisition of contextual fear learning is influenced by an optimum level of dorsal PAG activation, which extends from during to shortly after predator exposure and depends on local NO release.","[Rufino, Rodrigo de Andrade; Mota-Ortiz, Sandra Regina; Xavier De Lima, Miguel Antonio; Canteras, Newton Sabino] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Anat, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Baldo, Marcus Vinicius C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Physiol & Biophys, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Canteras, Newton Sabino] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Anat, Ave Lineu Prestes 2415, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",,"Canteras, NS (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Anat, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Canteras, NS (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Anat, Ave Lineu Prestes 2415, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",newton@icb.usp.br,,"Canteras, Newton/0000-0002-7205-5372; Xavier de Lima, Miguel Antonio/0000-0002-9572-9026","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/05432-9, 2009/53390-5]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/02540-5, 2016/10389-0]",This research was supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)-Research Grants #2014/05432-9 (awarded to N.S.C) and #2009/53390-5 (awarded to S.R.M.O.).

Our systematic literature search identified 16 different operationalizations of the extinction retention index. Correlation coefficients among these different operationalizations as well as among measures of fear/anxiety show a wide range of variability in four independent datasets, with similar findings across datasets.

Studies indicate that cat odor and trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a synthetic compound isolated from fox feces, are often presented to rodents to induce fear-related responses including freezing, avoidance, stress hormone and, in some tests, risk assessment behavior. Furthermore, we report that different amounts of cat odor impregnated on small-, medium-, or large-sized cloths impact the display of fear-related behavior when presented to rats. That is, rats exposed to a large cat odor containing cloth exhibit an increase in fear behavior, particularly freezing, which remains at high levels in habituation tests administered over a period of 7 days. The large cloth also induces a long-lasting increase in avoidance behavior during repeated habituation and extinction tests. A review of the brain regions involved in predator odor-induced fear behavior indicates a modulatory role of the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and dorsal premammillary nucleus. In addition, the basolateral amygdala is involved in fear behavior induced by cat odor but not TMT, and the central amygdala does not appear to play a major behavioral role in predator odor-induced fear. Future research involving the use of predator odor is likely to rapidly expand knowledge on the neurobiology of fear, which has implications for understanding fear-related psychopathology.

Direct comparisons between child and adult populations are needed to determine developmental risk markers of fear and anxiety. We compared 267 children and 285 adults in a differential fear conditioning paradigm and generalization test. Skin conductance responses (SCR) and ratings of valence and arousal were obtained to indicate fear learning. Both groups displayed robust and similar differential conditioning on subjective and physiological levels. However, children showed heightened fear generalization compared to adults as indexed by higher arousal ratings and SCR to the generalization stimuli. Results indicate overgeneralization of conditioned fear as a developmental correlate of fear learning.

We observed that CS US pairings can enhance fear reactions beyond the effect of contingency instructions. Moreover, for all measures of fear, instructions elicited immediate fear reactions that could not be completely overridden by subsequent situational safety information. Finally, ROF following reinstatement for instructed CS+s was unaffected by actual experience. In summary, our results demonstrate the power of contingency instructions and reveal the additional impact of actual experience of CS US pairings.","[Mertens, Gaetan; De Houwer, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kuhn, Manuel; Lonsdorf, Tina B.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Syst Neurosci, Hamburg, Germany; [Raes, An K.] Artevelde Univ Coll Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Kalisch, Raffael] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Med Ctr, Neuroimaging Ctr Mainz, Focus Program Translat Neurosci, D-55122 Mainz, Germany",,"Mertens, G (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Gaetan.Mertens@UGent.be,"De Houwer, Jan/ABF-6866-2021; Kalisch, Raffael/A-9863-2018; Lonsdorf, Tina/K-8657-2017; Kuhn, Manuel/AAO-8989-2020","De Houwer, Jan/0000-0003-0488-5224; Kuhn, Manuel/0000-0003-2210-9130; Mertens, Gaetan/0000-0003-1923-6657; Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846",Interuniversity Attraction Poles ProgramBelgian Federal Science Policy Office; Belgian Science Policy OfficeBelgian Federal Science Policy Office [IUAPVII/33]; Ghent University Methusalem [BOF09/01M00209],The research reported in this paper was funded by the Interuniversity Attraction Poles Program initiated by the Belgian Science Policy Office (IUAPVII/33) and by Ghent University Methusalem [grant number BOF09/01M00209].,,47,16,16,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

The current paper reviews three manipulations that have shown promise in achieving a reduction of conditional fear that is more resistant to relapse than is the reduction of conditional fear after standard extinction: novelty-facilitated extinction training, presentation of conditional-unconditional stimulus pairings or of unpaired unconditional stimuli during extinction, and extinction with additional stimuli that are similar to the original conditional stimuli. It summarizes past research involving human and non-human animal subjects and highlights knowledge gaps in the current literature. Moreover, it discusses potential mechanisms that mediate the reduction of fear seen as a result of these manipulations in an attempt to enhance our understanding of what renders fear extinction less vulnerable to the known pathways to fear relapse. It is hoped that this review will contribute to the achievement of the goal that was denied to Watson and Rayner, the development of experimental techniques that can be utilized to remove conditioned emotional responses permanently.","[Lipp, Ottmar V.; Luck, Camilla C.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Waters, Allison M.; Ryan, Katherine M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Craske, Michelle G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA",,"Lipp, OV (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",ottmar.lipp@curtin.edu.au,"; Lipp, Ottmar/A-1254-2007","Luck, Camilla/0000-0002-9364-1418; Lipp, Ottmar/0000-0001-6734-8608",National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1156490],This work was supported by Grant APP1156490 from the National Health and Medical Research Council.,,65,10,10,4,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

In this study, participants were presented with repeated pairings of a conditioned stimulus with a shock, in either a single-cue or differential conditioning paradigm. Generalisation of fear was then tested by presenting stimuli that were novel, but similar to the conditioned stimulus along a spatial stimulus dimension. Dependent measures were online shock expectancy ratings and skin conductance level. A diverse range of generalisation gradients was observed, and the shape of the gradients for both expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses corresponded with participants' verbally reported rules. The findings point to an important role for cognitively controlled processes in human fear generalisation, and provide support for a single-system learning model. They also highlight the potential importance of cognitive reappraisal in clinical treatments for over-generalised fear.","[Wong, Alex H.

However, it is still unclear which fears are most important (e.g., food, weight gain), which has practical implications, given treatments for eating-related fear necessitate modifications based on the specific fear driving ED pathology. For example, exposure treatments should be optimized based on specific fears that maintain pathology. The current study (N= 1,622 combined clinical ED and undergraduate sample) begins to answer questions on the precise nature of ED fears and how they operate with other ED symptoms. Method We used network analysis to create two models of ED fears and symptoms. The first model consisted of ED fears only (e.g., fears of food, fears of weight gain) to identify which fear is most central. The second model consisted of ED fears and ED symptoms to detect how ED fears operate with ED symptoms. Results We foundfear of disliking how one's body feels due to weight gain, disliking eating in social situations, feeling tense around food, fear of judgment due to weight gain,andfood anxietywere the most central ED fears. We also identified several bridge symptoms between ED fears and symptoms. Finally, we found that the most central ED fears predicted excessive exercise at two-month follow-up. Discussion These data support the idea that consequences (i.e., judgment) associated with fears of weight gain and interoceptive fears are the most central ED fears. These data have implications for the future development of precision interventions targeted to address ED-related fear.","[Levinson, Cheri A.; Williams, Brenna M.] Univ Louisville, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",,"Levinson, CA (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",cheri.levinson@louisville.edu,,"Williams, Brenna/0000-0002-3938-9610; Levinson, Cheri/0000-0002-8098-6943",,,,59,14,14,5,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-3478,1098-108X,,INT J EAT DISORDER,Int.

Besides the well-known role of the hippocampus in encoding contextual fear behavior, growing evidence indicates that specific regions of the medial prefrontal cortex differentially regulate contextual fear acquisition and storage in both animals and humans that ultimately leads to expression of contextual fear memories. In this review, we provide a detailed description of the recent literature on the role of distinct prefrontal subregions in contextual fear behavior and provide a working model of the neuronal circuits involved in the acquisition, expression and generalization of contextual fear memories.","[Rozeske, R.

We hypothesized that the affective quality of handling techniques used during routine care influences the animals' fear of humans. We assessed responses of male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 32) to four handling treatments provided by caretakers from 57 to 74 days of age: (1) Minimal handling once weekly during cage cleaning (this handling was common to all treatments); (2) Exposed to a Passive hand for 2 min daily; (3) Tickled for 2 min daily, mimicking social play; (4) Restrained on back for 2 min daily, intended to mimic unreciprocated pinning by a dominant rat. Behaviour was assessed on days 77-87 during a Human Approach test of attraction to a human hand (HA; 2 min without hand, followed by 3 min with a familiar or unfamiliar passive hand), Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) and Cat Odour (CAT) tests of anxiety, and weighing and injection procedures (to assess ease of handling). In the HA test, Tickled rats reared (interpreted as non-fearful monitoring behaviour) more often than Restrained rats prior to hand presentation (P < 0.05). In the presence of the hand, Tickled rats reared more often, and made more hand contacts than Minimally-handled rats, and uttered more 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (interpreted as indicating positive affect) than rats from the Passive treatment. Both Tickled and Restrained rats spent more time near the hand than Minimally-handled rats (P < 0.05). Although rats from all treatments directed more behaviour towards a familiar hand, Tickled rats visited an unfamiliar hand more often than Minimally-handled rats (P < 0.05). The handling treatments did not affect ease of handling during weighing, or behaviour in the EPM or CAT tests. During the minute after receiving an intra-peritoneal injection, rats from the Tickled and Passive treatments spent more time rearing close to the experimenter than rats from the Minimally-handled and Restraint treatments (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, rats (N = 16) were tickled by one handler, and restrained by another. for 2 min daily over 15 days. When preference for the two handlers was compared, rats spent similar time near, and in contact with, both handlers, but nibbled their tickler's hand (interpreted as play solicitation) more often than the hand of their restraint handler (P < 0.05). The results from both experiments indicate that, unexpectedly, the Restraint treatment was not aversive to the rats. Both the Passive and Restraint treatments had some value in habituating rats to humans relative to minimal handling. Nevertheless, tickling was the most effective method for reducing rats' fear of humans and hence improving their emotional welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Historical criteria for identifying fundamental components of anxiety are described and revised criteria are offered. The revised criteria are based on logical rhetorical arguments using a constituent reductionist postpositivist approach supported by the available empirical data. The revised criteria are then used to assess several fears posited as fundamental, including fear of the unknown.

This effect is likely to be mediated by a subcortical brain network centered on the amygdala. Consistent with this view, brain imaging studies show that masked facial stimuli activate the amygdala as do masked pictures of threatening animals such as snakes and spiders. When the stimulus conditions allow conscious processing, the amygdala response to feared stimuli is enhanced and a cortical network that includes the anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula is activated. However, the initial amygdala response to a fear-relevant but non-feared stimulus (e.g. pictures of spiders for a snake phobic) disappears with conscious processing and the cortical network is not recruited. Instead there is activation of the dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortices that appears to inhibit the amygdala response. The data suggest that activation of the amygdala is mediated by a subcortical pathway, which passes through the superior colliculi and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus before accessing the amygdala, and which operates on low spatial frequency information.

Upon retrieval a memory may be rendered labile and vulnerable to the disruptive effects of amnestic agents. This process is referred to as disrupting reconsolidation and may point to a novel therapeutic strategy for the permanent reduction of fear in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. However, the fear-reducing effects are thus far only demonstrated for freezing reactions in rodents and autonomic fear responding in humans. If disrupting reconsolidation will be of value for clinical practice, it should also target the subjective feelings of anxiety. Using an instructed fear-learning paradigm in humans, we here tested whether disrupting reconsolidation would diminish the subjective feelings of anxiety for a noxious event that was anticipated but never actually experienced. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade during reconsolidation strongly diminished the behavioral expression of the instructed fear memory (i.e., startle responding) as well as the subjective feelings of anxiety 24 h later, yet without affecting both the physiological and cognitive component of the anticipation of threat (i.e., skin conductance responding, expectancy ratings). Together, the present findings suggest that the various memory traces of a learned fear association do not necessarily undergo reconsolidation in harmony. Considering that patients with anxiety disorders (1) often fear objects and situations that they have never actually experienced, and (2) primarily suffer from the subjective feelings of anxiety, the present findings may have important ramifications for psychotherapy.

However, survivors treated with novel therapies are vulnerable to high levels of fear of cancer recurrence or progression (FCR). Existing FCR interventions have rarely been trialled in people with advanced cancer. The current study aimed to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of Fear-Less: a stepped-care model to treat FCR in people with metastatic melanoma treated with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. Sixty-one outpatients with metastatic melanoma were screened using the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Short Form (FCRI-SF) and Fear of Progression Questionnaire Short Form (FoP-Q-SF). Survivors with subthreshold FCR were stratified to a self-management intervention while those with clinical levels of FCR were provided with an individual therapy, Conquer Fear. Survivor experience surveys and rescreening were administered post-intervention completion. Results indicated that Fear-Less was an acceptable and feasible FCR intervention. Results provided preliminary support for the potential impact of Fear-Less in reducing FCR. Fear-Less is a promising first step in providing an acceptable and feasible stepped-care model to treat FCR in survivors with metastatic disease.","[Lynch, Fiona A.; Ellen, Steve; Dax, Victoria; Diggens, Justine; Elliott, Jane; Ftanou, Maria] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Psychosocial Oncol Program, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Katona, Lynda; Kent, Holly] Alfred Hlth, Dept Psychol & Consultat Liaison Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Jefford, Michael; Lai-Kwon, Julia] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Dept Med Oncol, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Jefford, Michael] Australian Canc Survivorship Ctr, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Jefford, Michael; Phipps-Nelson, Jo] Univ Melbourne, Fac Med Dent & Hlth Sci, Sir Peter MacCallum Dept Oncol, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ben Smith, Allan] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Oncol Educ & Res Translat, South Western Sydney Clin Sch, Ingham Inst Appl Med Res, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Shaw, Joanne; Dhillon, Haryana M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Psychooncol Cooperat Res Grp PoCoG, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Dhillon, Haryana M.] Univ Sydney, Ctr Med Psychol & Evidence Based Decis Making, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Ellen, Steve] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Phipps-Nelson, Jo; Milne, Donna] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Hlth Serv & Implementat Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Milne, Donna] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Dept Skin & Melanoma Serv, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Russell, Lahiru] Deakin Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Inst Hlth Transformat, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia; [Russell, Lahiru] Ctr Qual & Patient Safety Eastern Hlth Partnershi, Box Hill, Vic 3128, Australia; [Button-Sloan, Alison] Melanoma Patients Australia, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Button-Sloan, Alison] Melanoma Res Victoria Consumer Reference Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Button-Sloan, Alison] Australian Melanoma Consumer Alliance, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Shackleton, Mark; Burridge, Hayley] Alfred Hlth, Dept Med Oncol, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Shackleton, Mark] Monash Univ, Dept Med, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ftanou, Maria] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Mental Hlth, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",,"Lynch, FA (corresponding author), Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Psychosocial Oncol Program, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",fiona.lynch@petermac.org; l.katona@alfred.org.au; michael.jefford@petermac.org; ben.smith@unsw.edu.au; joanne.shaw@sydney.edu.au; haryana.dhillon@sydney.edu.au; steve.ellen@petermac.org; Jo.Phipps-Nelson@petermac.org; julia.lai-kwon@icr.ac.uk; donna.milne@petermac.org; l.russell@deakin.edu.au; victoria.dax@petermac.org; justine.diggens@petermac.org; holly.kent@alfred.org.au; buttonsloan@bigpond.com; jane.rws@gmail.com; mark.shackleton@monash.edu; h.burrdige@alfred.org.au; maria.ftanou@petermac.org,,"Smith, Allan 'Ben'/0000-0002-2496-7369; Dhillon, Haryana/0000-0003-4039-5169; Sandhu, Shahneen/0000-0002-8660-4475",Victorian Government,The Fear-Less project was supported by the Victorian Government.,,46,6,6,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

This is supported by post-extinction phenomena demonstrating the return of fear, such as reinstatement. Recent work has questioned this account, claiming that extinction initiated immediately after fear acquisition can abolish the return of fear. In the current study, participants were fear conditioned to four different conditioned stimuli (CS) and underwent extinction either immediately or after a 24 h delay. During extinction, we manipulated CS contingency awareness by presenting two of the CSs (one CS+, one CS-) under non-masked conditions and the other two CSs under masked conditions. Compared to delayed extinction, immediate extinction of non-masked CSs promoted less extinction of fear-potentiated startle and shock expectancy ratings and less reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle without affecting shock expectancy ratings. Critically, future research should clarify how the differences between immediate and delayed extinction in within-session extinction modulate the recovery of fear. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed data from 17 young healthy subjects undergoing a fear conditioning task, followed by a fear extinction task 24 h later, both recorded with simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements, with a polysomnographically recorded night sleep in between. Our results showed a correlation between vmPFC activity during fear conditioning and subsequent REM sleep amount, as well as between REM sleep amount and SCR to the conditioned stimulus 24 h later. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between vmPFC activity during fear conditioning and SCR responses during extinction, which was no longer significant after controlling for REM sleep amount. vmPFC activity during fear conditioning was further correlated with sleep latency. Interestingly, hippocampus activity during fear conditioning was correlated with stage 2 and stage 4 sleep amount. Our results provide preliminary evidence that the relationship between REM sleep and fear conditioning and extinction observed in rodents can be modeled in healthy human subjects, highlighting an interrelated set of potentially relevant trait markers.","[Spoormaker, V.

This study describes a novel training protocol to assess phasic and sustained fear in freely behaving C57BL/6J mice, using freezing and/or fear-potentiated startle as measures of fear, thereby, if needed, allowing in vivo application of various techniques, such as optogenetics, electrophysiology and pharmacological intervention, in freely behaving animals. An auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, with pseudo-randomized conditioned-unconditioned stimulus presentations at various durations, is combined with repetitive brief auditory white noise burst presentations during fear memory retrieval 24 h after fear conditioning. Major findings are that (1) a motion sensitive platform built on mechano-electrical transducers enables measurement of startle responses in freely behaving mice, (2) absence or presence of startle stimuli during retrieval as well as unpredictability of a given threat determine phasic and sustained fear response profiles and (3) both freezing and startle responses indicate phasic and sustained components of behavioral fear, with sustained freezing reflecting unpredictability of conditioned stimulus (CS)/unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings. This paradigm and available genetically modified mouse lines will pave the way for investigation of the molecular and neural mechanisms relating to the transition from phasic to sustained fear.","[Daldrup, T.; Remmes, J.; Lesting, J.; Gaburro, S.; Pape, H. -C.; Seidenbecher, T.] Univ Munster, Inst Physiol 1, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Fendt, M.] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Fendt, M.] Otto Von Guericke Univ, Ctr Behav Brain Sci, Magdeburg, Germany; [Meuth, P.] Univ Munster, Dept Neurol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Meuth, P.] Univ Munster, Inst Neuropathophysiol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Kloke, V.] Univ Munster, Dept Behav Biol, D-48149 Munster, Germany",,"Seidenbecher, T (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Inst Physiol 1, Robert Koch Str 27a, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",papechris@ukmuenster.de; seidenbe@uni-muenster.de,"Fendt, Markus/G-1888-2013; Gaburro, Stefano/AAN-3752-2020","Fendt, Markus/0000-0002-3451-1226; Gaburro, Stefano/0000-0001-9297-3472","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB-TRR58, TP A02]","We thank E.

Design: Habituation of the rats to handling and baseline recordings were obtained over 2 consecutive days. Afterward, the rats were subjected to shock training (ST, day 1), context reexposure (CR; either 30 or 60 min; day 2), and fear recall (R; day 3). Percentage time spent in freezing (FT%) was observed during ST, CR, and R exposures. Sleep was recorded for 20 h (8-h light and 12-h dark period) following ST CR, and R. Setting: NA. Subjects: The subjects were outbred Wistar rats randomly assigned to one of two groups: contextual fear (FR; n = 7) or contextual extinction (EXT, n = 7). Interventions: The rats were surgically implanted with electrodes for recording the electroencephalogram and electromyogram for determining arousal state. Measurements and Results: There were no differences between groups on FT% during ST or the first 30 min of CR; however, during R, the FIR group had greater FT% than EXT Sleep did not differ between groups following ST Following CR, EXT exhibited significantly more total sleep, NREM, and REM than FR. After R, there were no differences between groups. Conclusions: Rats that exhibit extinction of contextual fear show significantly increased sleep compared to rats who continue to exhibit contextual fear. This suggests that sleep disturbances normally experienced in humans following traumatic events or reminders may be ameliorated by therapies that address and eliminate the associated fear.","[Wellman, Laurie L.; Yang, Linghui; Tang, Xiangdong; Sanford, Larry D.] Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Dept Anat & Pathol, Sleep Res Lab, Norfolk, VA 23507 USA",,"Sanford, LD (corresponding author), Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Dept Anat & Pathol, Sleep Res Lab, POB 1980, Norfolk, VA 23507 USA.",SanforLD@evms.edu,,"Tang, Xiangdong/0000-0001-6876-3328","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH064827, R01MH061716] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH061716, R01 MH064827, MH64827, MH61716] Funding Source: Medline",,,31,44,44,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0161-8105,1550-9109,,SLEEP,Sleep,JUL 1,2008,31,7,,,,,1035,1042,,,,,8,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology,321GX,WOS:000257293800015,18652099,,,,2022-03-23,

Interestingly, the declarative memory for the fear association remained intact. These results asked for a solid replication. Moreover, given the constructive nature of memories, the intact recollection of the fear association could eventually 'rebuild' the fear memory, resulting in the spontaneous recovery of the fear response. Yet, perseverance of the amnesic effects would have substantial clinical implications, as even the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders display high percentages of relapse. Using a differential fear conditioning procedure in humans, we replicated our previous findings by showing that administering propranolol (40 mg) prior to memory reactivation eliminated the startle fear response 24 h later. But most importantly, this effect persisted at one month follow-up. Notably, the propranolol manipulation not only left the declarative memory for the acquired contingency untouched, but also skin conductance discrimination. In addition, a close association between declarative knowledge and skin conductance responses was found. These findings are in line with the supposed double dissociation of fear conditioning and declarative knowledge relative to the amygdala and hippocampus in humans. They support the view that skin conductance conditioning primarily reflects contingency learning, whereas the startle response is a rather specific measure of fear. Furthermore, the results indicate the absence of a causal link between the actual knowledge of a fear association and its fear response, even though they often operate in parallel. Interventions targeting the amygdalar fear memory may be essential in specifically and persistently dampening the emotional impact of fear. From a clinical and ethical perspective, disrupting reconsolidation points to promising interventions persistently erasing fear responses from trauma memory without affecting the actual recollection.

This study tested the hypothesis that the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF1) antagonist GSK561679 differentially reduces anxiety but increases fear in humans. A total of 31 healthy females received each of four treatments; placebo, 50 mg GSK561679 (low-GSK), 400 mg GSK561679 (high-GSK), and I mg alprazolam in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions during each of the four treatments. The three conditions included one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second during which shocks were administered unpredictably, and a third condition without shock. Fear and anxiety were assessed using the acoustic startle reflex. High-GSK had no effect on startle potentiation during unpredictable threat (anxiety) but increased startle potentiation during the predictable condition (fear). Low-GSK did not affect startle potentiation across conditions. Consistent with previous findings, alprazolam reduced startle potentiation during unpredictable threat but not during predictable threat. The increased fear by high-GSK replicates animal findings and suggests a lift of the inhibitory effect of the BNST on the amygdala by the CRF1 antagonist.","[Grillon, Christian; Hale, Elizabeth; Lieberman, Lynne; Davis, Andrew; Pine, Daniel S.; Ernst, Monique] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, MAP, 15K North Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 113,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,"Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019",,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIA MH002798]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH069056]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798, U19MH069056] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health (ZIA MH002798) and by the NIMH grant MH069056 to CG.

Oxytocin (OT) is a mammalian neuropeptide that modulates activation of fear extinction-based neural circuits and fear responses. Little is known, however, about the effects of OT treatment on conditioned fear responding and extinction in humans. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of OT in a fear-potentiated startle task of fear conditioning and extinction. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 44 healthy human participants was conducted. Participants underwent a conditioned fear acquisition procedure, after which they were randomized to treatment group and delivered OT (24 IU) or placebo via intranasal (IN) spray. Forty-five minutes after treatment, participants underwent extinction training. Twenty-four hours later, subjects were tested for extinction recall. Relative to placebo, the OT group showed increased fear-potentiated startle responding during the earliest stage of extinction training relative to placebo; however, all treatment groups showed the same level of reduced responding by the end of extinction training. Twenty-four hours later, the OT group showed significantly higher recall of extinction relative to placebo. The current study provides preliminary evidence that OT may facilitate fear extinction recall in humans. These results support further study of OT as a potential adjunctive treatment for extinction-based therapies in fear-related disorders.","[Acheson, Dean; Feifel, David; Mckinney, Rebecca; Lohr, James; Risbrough, Victoria] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [de Wilde, Sofieke] Univ Utrecht, Div Pharmacol, Utrecht Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Lohr, James; Risbrough, Victoria] Vet Affairs Ctr Excellence Stress & Mental Hlth C, La Jolla, CA USA",,"Risbrough, V (corresponding author), Vet Affairs Ctr Excellence Stress & Mental Hlth C, La Jolla, CA USA.",vrisbrough@ucsd.edu,"Feifel, David/AAB-9541-2020; Risbrough, Victoria/X-3344-2019",,"Veterans Affairs Center for Excellence in Stress and Mental Health; Defense Medical Research and Development Program [DM102425, R34 MH091285]; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD) Young Investigator Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R34MH091285] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","These studies were supported by the Veterans Affairs Center for Excellence in Stress and Mental Health (VB, JL), Defense Medical Research and Development Program award #DM102425 (VB, DA), R34 MH091285 (DF), and a Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD) Young Investigator Award (DA).",,47,95,99,1,50,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,SEP,2013,229,1,,,,,199,208,,10.1007/s00213-013-3099-4,,,10,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,202LY,WOS:000323219300020,23644911,Green Accepted,,,2022-03-23,

Evidence suggests that the return of conditioned fear through spontaneous recovery, reinstatement, or renewal can be prevented by blockading this reconsolidation process using pharmacological or behavioral interventions. Postretrieval-extinction learning has been shown to prevent the return of cued fear in humans using fear-irrelevant stimuli, as well as cued and contextual fear in rodents. The effects of postretrieval extinction on human contextually controlled cued fear to fear-relevant stimuli remain unknown, and are the focus of the present study. The experimental design was based on 3 consecutive days: acquisition, reactivation and extinction, and re-extinction. For the fear conditioning, 2 zoo frames served as different contexts, 5 fear-relevant stimuli (aversive animal pictures) served as conditioned stimuli (CS), electric shocks served as unconditioned stimuli (UCS). Expectancy ratings and skin-conductance response (SCR) were used as measures of fear responses; spontaneous recovery and renewal were used as indicators of the return of fear. The expectancy ratings and SCR results indicated spontaneous recovery on the third day, regardless of retrieval prior to extinction. No robust renewal effect was seen. It is suggested that the use of fear-relevant stimuli, the context salience, or reactivation context may explain the lack of reconsolidation effect. Our study indicates that the beneficial effects of postretrieval-extinction learning are sensitive to subtle methodological changes.","[Drexler, Shira Meir; Merz, Christian J.; Hamacher-Dang, Tanja C.; Marquardt, Veronica; Otto, Tobias; Wolf, Oliver T.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Drexler, Shira Meir; Hamacher-Dang, Tanja C.; Wolf, Oliver T.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Int Grad Sch Neurosci, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Fritsch, Nathalie] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Expt Psychol Lab, D-44780 Bochum, Germany",,"Wolf, OT (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Psychol, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",oliver.t.wolf@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,"Merz, Christian J/I-7635-2019","Merz, Christian J/0000-0001-5679-6595; Wolf, Oliver T./0000-0002-9320-2124; Otto, Tobias/0000-0002-9994-0910; Meir Drexler, Shira/0000-0001-8797-6900","German Research Foundation (DFG) Research Unit 1581 [WO 733/13-1, WO 733/13-2]","Funding for this study was provided by Project P5 (WO 733/13-1; 13-2) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) Research Unit 1581, Extinction Learning: Neural Mechanisms, Behavioral Manifestations, and Clinical Implications.

However, there is a distinct need for methodology that aims to specifically address and prime fear under dynamic conditions, and to better determine the role of fear in movement preparation. This preliminary study investigated how fear priming influences fear of falling in young and older individuals, and assessed how changes in fear of falling map to movement behavior. Young (21.5 +/- 1.7 years,n= 10) and older (58.1 +/- 2.2 years) participants matched for height, weight, and sex were repeatedly exposed to four different and incrementally challenging laboratory-based slipping perturbations during a self-initiated, goal-directed step and reach task. Both younger and older cohorts showed similar heightened perceptions in fear of falling after fear priming, and changes in peak joint excursions including reduced ankle flexion, and increased lumbar flexion after fear priming. Age-related changes were only evident in total mediolateral center of mass displacement, with younger participants showing greater displacement after fear priming. Despite clear differences in preparatory muscle onsets relative to reach onset seen in older participants, muscle timings or co-contraction indices were not significantly different. Methods utilizing repeated exposure to varying increases of a slip-based postural challenge can successfully prime fear of falling in individuals, regardless of age.","[Stamenkovic, Alexander; van der Veen, Susanne M.; Thomas, James S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Motor Control Lab, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [van der Veen, Susanne M.; Thomas, James S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",,"Thomas, JS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Motor Control Lab, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.; Thomas, JS (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",jthomas32@vcu.edu,"van der Veen, Susanne/ABA-9346-2020; Stamenkovic, Alexander/B-7395-2013","van der Veen, Susanne/0000-0003-2799-6816; Stamenkovic, Alexander/0000-0002-1010-9347","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01HD088417, R01AT006978]",AS was supported by NIH R01AT006978.

Although prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has identified brain regions that support Pavlovian conditioning, it remains unclear whether these regions support time-related processes important for this type of associative learning. Elucidating the neural substrates of temporal conditioning is important for a complete understanding of the Pavlovian conditioning process. Therefore, the present study used a temporal Pavlovian conditioning procedure to investigate brain activity that mediates the formation of temporal associations. During fMRI, twenty-three healthy volunteers completed a temporal conditioning procedure and a control task that does not support conditioning. Specifically, during the temporal conditioning procedure, the UCS was presented at fixed intervals (ITI: 20 s) while in the control condition the UCS was presented at random intervals (Average ITI: 20 s, ITI Range: 6-34 s). We observed greater skin conductance responses and expectancy of the UCS during fixed (i.e., temporal conditioning) relative to random (i.e., control procedure) interval trials. These findings demonstrate fixed trials support temporal conditioning, while random trials do not. During fixed interval trials, greater conditioned fMRI signal responses were observed within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, inferior and middle temporal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The current findings suggest these brain regions constitute a neural circuit that encodes the temporal information necessary for Pavlovian fear conditioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, aberrant dopaminergic VTA signaling has also been implicated in anxiety-like behaviors in animal models. These findings, however, have yet to be extended to anxiety in humans. Here we hypothesized that clinical anxiety is linked to dysfunction of the mesocorticolimbic circuit during threat processing in humans; specifically, excessive or dysregulated activity of the mesocorticolimbic aversion circuit may be etiologically related to errors in distinguishing cues of threat versus safety, also known as overgeneralization of fear. To test this, we recruited 32 females with generalized anxiety disorder and 25 age-matched healthy control females. We measured brain activity using fMRI while participants underwent a fear generalization task consisting of pseudo-randomly presented rectangles with systematically varying widths. A mid-sized rectangle served as a conditioned stimulus (CS; 50% electric shock probability) and rectangles with widths of CS +/- 20%, +/- 40%, and +/- 60% served as generalization stimuli (GS; never paired with electric shock). Healthy controls showed VTA reactivity proportional to the cue's perceptual similarity to CS (threat). In contrast, patients with generalized anxiety disorder showed heightened and less discriminating VTA reactivity to GS, a feature that was positively correlated with trait anxiety, as well as increased mesocortical and decreased mesohippocampal coupling. Our results suggest that the human VTA and the mesocorticolimbic system play a crucial role in threat processing, and that abnormalities in this system are implicated in maladaptive threat processing in clinical anxiety.","[Cha, Jiook; Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Program Neurosci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Cha, Jiook] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Cha, Jiook] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Carlson, Joshua M.; DeDora, Daniel J.; Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Carlson, Joshua M.] No Michigan Univ, Dept Psychol, Marquette, MI 49855 USA; [Greenberg, Tsafrir; Proudfit, Greg H.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Dept Radiol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA",,"Mujica-Parodi, LR (corresponding author), Lab Computat Neurodiagnost, Dept Biomed Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",lilianne.strey@stonybrook.edu,"Greenberg, Tsafrir/Q-7831-2016; Cha, Jiook/A-5678-2013","Cha, Jiook/0000-0002-5314-7992; Mujica-Parodi, Lilianne/0000-0002-3752-5519; Greenberg, Tsafrir/0000-0001-9104-5148",Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N0014-04-1-005]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0954643]; Directorate For EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [0954643] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank L.

Yet, because it has been assumed to be acute and transitory, predator-induced stress has not been much studied by either comparative physiologists or population ecologists, until relatively recently. The focus in biomedical research has always been on chronic stress in humans, which most comparative physiologists would agree results from sustained psychological stress linked to mere thoughts rather than acute physical crises (like surviving a predator attack) or chronic physical challenges (such as a shortage of food). Population ecologists have traditionally focused solely on the acute physical crisis of surviving a direct predator attack rather than whether the risk of such an attack may have a sustained effect on other demographic processes (e.g. the birth rate). Demographic experiments have now demonstrated that exposure to predators or predator cues can have sustained effects that extend to affecting birth and survival in free-living animals, and a subset of these have documented associated physiological stress effects. These and similar results have prompted some authors to speak of an ecology of fear, but others object that the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding predation remain unknown. Recent biomedical studies on animals in the laboratory have demonstrated that exposure to predators or predator cues can induce sustained psychological stress that is directly comparable to chronic stress in humans, and this has now in fact become one of the most common stressors used in studies of the animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We review these recent findings and suggest ways the laboratory techniques developed to measure the neural circuitry of fear could be adapted for use on free-living animals in the field, in order to: (i) test whether predator risk induces sustained psychological stress in wild animals, comparable to chronic stress in humans and (ii) directly investigate the cognitive and emotional aspects of avoiding predation and hence the ecology of fear.","[Clinchy, Michael] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; [Sheriff, Michael J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zanette, Liana Y.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Clinchy, M (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",mclinchy@uvic.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank Rudy Boonstra for organizing this Special Feature on the Ecology of Stress; Jay Schulkin for his persistence in encouraging us to explore the current research concerning the neurological effects of fear; Tony D.

In line with such evolutionary pressure, threat-signaling fear-conditioned faces have been found to rapidly (<80 ms) activate visual brain regions including the fusiform gyrus on the conditioning day. Whether remotely fear conditioned stimuli (CS) evoke similar early processing enhancements is unknown. Here, 16 participants who underwent a differential face fear-conditioning and extinction procedure on day 1 were presented the initial CS 24 h after conditioning (Recent Recall Test) as well as 9-17 months later (Remote Recall Test) while EEG was recorded. Using a data-driven segmentation procedure of CS evoked event-related potentials, five distinct microstates were identified for both the recent and the remote memory test. To probe intracranial activity, EEG activity within each microstate was localized using low resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA). In both the recent (41-55 and 150-191 ms) and remote (45-90 ms) recall tests, fear conditioned faces potentiated rapid activation in proximity of fusiform gyrus, even in participants unaware of the contingencies.

This research is guided by theoretical assumptions that, in some cases indirectly, stem from the tradition of association formation models (e.g., the Rescorla-Wagner model). We argue that one of these assumptions - fear responding as a monotonic function of the associative activation of aversive memory representations - restricts the types of treatment that the research community currently considers. We discuss the importance of this assumption in the context of research on extinction-enhancing and reconsolidation interference techniques. While acknowledging the merit of this research, we argue that unstrapping the straitjacket of this assumption can lead to exploring new directions for utilizing fear conditioning procedures in treatment research. We discuss two determinants of fear responding other than associative memory activation. First, fear responding might also depend on relational information. Second, a recent goal-directed emotion theory suggests that goals might be the primary determinant of the response pattern characterized as fear.","[Boddez, Yannick; Moors, Agnes; De Houwer, Jan] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Boddez, Yannick] Univ Groningen, Dept Clin Psychol & Expt Psychopathol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Moors, Agnes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Grp Quantitat Psychol & Individual Difference, Leuven, Belgium; [Moors, Agnes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Social & Cultural Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Mertens, Gaetan] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Boddez, Y (corresponding author), Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, Ghent 9000, Belgium.",yannick.boddez@ugent.be,"Mertens, Gaëtan/ABC-3386-2021; De Houwer, Jan/ABF-6866-2021; Moors, Agnes/C-6342-2008","Mertens, Gaëtan/0000-0003-1923-6657; De Houwer, Jan/0000-0003-0488-5224; Moors, Agnes/0000-0002-5137-557X","Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)FWO [G022313N, G073317N]; Research Fund of KU Leuven [C14/17/047]; Ghent University Methusalem Grant [BOF16/MET_V/002]; Dutch Fund for Scientific Research (NWO Vici)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [453-15-005]","Preparation of this article was supported by the Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO) (G022313N, G073317N), the Research Fund of KU Leuven (C14/17/047), Ghent University Methusalem Grant BOF16/MET_V/002, and the Dutch Fund for Scientific Research (NWO Vici) (453-15-005).

Humans have strong numerical effects on wild animal populations, as highly efficient hunters and through unintentional impacts of human activity and development. Human disturbance also induces costly non-lethal effects by changing the behavior of risk-averse animals. Here, we suggest that the unique strength of these lethal and non-lethal effects is amplified by mismatches between the nature of risk associated with anthropogenic stimuli and the corresponding response by wild animals. We discuss the unique characteristics of cues associated with anthropogenic stimuli in the context of animal ecology and evolutionary history to explore why and when animals fail to appropriately (a) detect, (b) assess, and (c) respond to both benign and lethal stimuli. We then explore the costs of over-response to a benign stimulus (Type I error) and under-response to a lethal stimulus (Type II error), which can scale up to affect individual fitness and ultimately drive population dynamics and shape ecological interactions. Finally, we highlight avenues for future research and discuss conservation measures that can better align animal perception and response with risk to mitigate unintended consequences of human disturbance.","[Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, Truckee, CA USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Smith, Justine A/AAY-2879-2021","Smith, Justine A/0000-0001-8753-4061; Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",Schmidt Science Fellows program; Rhodes Trust; UC Santa Barbara Library Open Access Publishing Fund,"KG was supported by the Schmidt Science Fellows program, in partnership with the Rhodes Trust.

To extend these findings to human volunteers, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural responses associated with context fear conditioning in humans. Our novel conditioning paradigm consisted of aversive electrical shocks ( unconditioned stimulus) that were delivered either cue or context related. Differential evoked responses, related to the conditioned stimulus (CS), were found in the anterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral insular cortices, regions that have been implicated in anticipatory anxiety. In case of context conditioning, a similar pattern was observed during the presentation of the entire context. In line with previous conditioning studies, differential responses in the amygdala showed a time by stimulus interaction, suggesting rapid adaptation of CS-specific responses. More importantly, a similar differential decay of activation was observed during context conditioning in the hippocampus, in agreement with a role of the hippocampus in the acquisition phase of human context fear conditioning.","[Marschner, Andreas; Kalisch, Raffael; Buechel, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Vansteenwegen, Debora] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Vervliet, Bram] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Marschner, A (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",a.marschner@uke.uni-hamburg.de,"Kalisch, Raffael/H-6624-2016; Vervliet, Bram/AAE-6276-2019; Kalisch, Raffael/A-9863-2018","Vervliet, Bram/0000-0002-5904-4257",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 1247]; Emmy NoetherGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KA 1623/3-1]; Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Volkswagen-StiftungVolkswagen,"This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Grants GRK 1247 ( A.

This is due in part to genetic variation between individuals. However, only few genes have been identified that contribute to variation in learning and memory. Two inbred mouse strains, C57Bl/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), show significant variation both in fear conditioning memory as well as primary responsiveness to fear. Several studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes (Chr) 1 and 12 associated with performance in fear conditioning, but it is unclear if these QTL were associated with fear memory or innate fear responsiveness. To determine if these QTL are associated with fear memory or fear responsiveness, we studied congenic mouse strains harbouring D2-derived DNA from Chr1 or Chr12 on a B6 genetic background. Cohorts of D2, B6 and the congenic mice were tested throughout the process of fear conditioning by measuring a series of fear-related parameters. The Chr1 congenic mice showed clear deficits in fear memory compared to B6 mice, which established the presence of a QTL on Chr1 directly influencing fear memory. The Chr12 congenic mice also showed alterations in fear conditioning, but this was more associated with alterations in fear responsiveness. These findings thus provide evidence for the localisation of independent genetic determinants for fear memory and fear responsiveness.","[Wilson, Yvette M.; Murphy, Mark] Univ Melbourne, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Brodnicki, Thomas C.] St Vincents Inst, Immunol & Diabet Unit, Fitzroy, Vic 3065, Australia; [Lawrence, Andrew J.] Univ Melbourne, Florey Neurosci Inst, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Lawrence, Andrew J.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Neurosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",,"Murphy, M (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Anat & Cell Biol, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",m.murphy@unimelb.edu.au,,"WILSON, YVETTE/0000-0002-1354-9540; Brodnicki, Thomas/0000-0003-2294-315X",National Health and Medical Research Council of AustraliaNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,"These studies were supported by a project grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

The Fear of Birth Scale has been proposed as a valid measure suitable for assessing fear of birth in an antenatal clinical context. To make sure that the scale makes sense in relation to the known constructs of fear of birth, it is important to find out what women think when responding to the Fear of Birth Scale. Aim: To report what women in mid-pregnancy think when assessing fear of birth on the Fear of Birth Scale. Methods: A qualitative design using semi-structured interviews with a think aloud technique was used. Thirty-one women were recruited in gestational week 17-20. Content analysis was conducted to describe the different dimensions of fear of birth. Findings: Worry was described as unspecific feelings and thoughts, often with a negative loading. Fear was described as a strong feeling connected to something specific. Furthermore, the women thought about aspects that influence their worries and fears and explained the strategies that helped them to cope with their fear of birth. Conclusion: Women could clearly assess, describe, and discuss fear of birth using the Fear of Birth Scale. This supports the use of the Fear of Birth Scale in clinical settings as a starting point for further dialogue about women's fear of birth. The dialogue may identify women's need for information, treatment, and referral when necessary. (C) 2015 Australian College of Midwives. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While fear-conditioned stimuli (CS+) elicit overt behavior in many mammals, this is not the case in humans. Typically, autonomic nervous system activity is used to quantify fear memory in humans, measured by skin conductance responses (SCR). Here, we investigate whether heart period responses (HPR) evoked by the CS, often observed in humans and small mammals, are suitable to complement SCR as an index of fear memory in humans. We analyze four datasets involving delay and trace conditioning, in which heart beats are identified via electrocardiogram or pulse oximetry, to show that fear-conditioned heart rate deceleration (bradycardia) is elicited and robustly distinguishes CS+ from CS-. We then develop a psychophysiological model (PsPM) of fear-conditioned HPR. This PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of autonomic input into the heart. We show that the sensitivity to distinguish CS+ and CS- (predictive validity) is higher for model-based estimates than peak-scoring analysis, and compare this with SCR. Our work provides a novel tool to investigate fear memory in humans that allows direct comparison between species.","[Castegnetti, Giuseppe; Tzovara, Athina; Staib, Matthias; Paulus, Philipp C.; Hofer, Nicolas; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Castegnetti, Giuseppe; Tzovara, Athina; Staib, Matthias; Paulus, Philipp C.; Hofer, Nicolas; Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Paulus, Philipp C.] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Psychol, Dresden, Germany; [Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England",,"Castegnetti, G (corresponding author), Psychiat Univ Klin Zurich, Lenggstr 31, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",giuseppe.castegnetti@uzh.ch,"Bach, Dominik R/B-4302-2019","Bach, Dominik R/0000-0003-3717-2036; Tzovara, Athina/0000-0002-7588-1418; Staib, Matthias/0000-0001-9688-838X; Paulus, Philipp C./0000-0002-8148-3467",University of Zurich; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [320030_1449586/1]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [091593/Z/10/Z],This work was funded by the University of Zurich and by a project grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to DRB (320030_1449586/1).

To investigate these dimensions in birds, we have used two genetic lines of quail divergently selected on tonic immobility duration, a behavioural index of fear. These two lines differ in their behavioural response to some, but not all, fear-inducing situations. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of human intervention in the differentiation between the two lines. To do this, fear responses towards a novel object were compared between lines in three conditions: (1) in the home cage without any human intervention, (2) in the home cage after human handling and (3) after placement in a novel environment by human handling. Fear behaviour differed between lines after human handling, with or without placement in a novel environment, but presentation of a novel object in the home cage without any human intervention induced similar fear responses in the two lines of quail. These results lead us to suggest that in quail, human intervention evokes a dimension of fear that differs from that evoked by sudden presentation of a novel object, in that these two dimensions may be selected independently.

In this regard, it has been shown that stress affects aversive learning and memory processes. In rodents, stress exposure 10 days prior to fear acquisition impairs fear extinction. However, in humans the effect of distal stress on fear conditioning is sparse. Therefore, we examined the influence of distal stress on fear memory in humans in two studies. In Study 1, participants underwent either socially evaluated cold-pressor test (SECPT) or sham procedure 10 days or 40 min before a fear conditioning paradigm (four groups, N = 78). In Study 2, context effects were examined by conducting SECPT and sham procedures 10 days prior conditioning either in the later fear conditioning context or in another context (three groups, N = 69). During acquisition phase, one geometrical shape (conditioned stimulus, CS +) was paired with painful electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US), but never a second shape (CS -). Extinction phase was identical to acquisition, but without US delivery. Importantly, for Study 1 these phases were conducted on one day, while for Study 2 on two separated days. Successful fear acquisition was indicated by aversive ratings and startle potentiation to CS + versus CS - in both studies. Interestingly, participants stressed 10 days earlier showed impaired extinction on the implicit level (startle potentiation to CS + vs. CS -) in Study 1 and only in the acquisition context on the explicit level (aversive ratings for CS + vs. CS -) in Study 2. In sum, distal stress may strengthen later acquired fear memories and thereby impair fear extinction. This finding could have clinical implications, showing that prior stress exposure sensitizes later aversive processing and impairs therapy.","[Klinke, Christopher M.; Andreatta, Marta] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Wurzburg, Germany; [Fiedler, Dominik; Lange, Maren D.] Univ Munster, Inst Physiol, Munster, Germany; [Andreatta, Marta] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol Educ Sci & Child Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Andreatta, M (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",marta.andreatta@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Andreatta, Marta/Y-6551-2019","Andreatta, Marta/0000-0002-1217-8266","German Research Foundation (DFG): Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety DisordersGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB-TRR 58]","The present work was funded and supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG): Collaborative Research Center Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, SFB-TRR 58 project B08.

Much of this research utilizes classical fear conditioning, a simple paradigm that has been extensively investigated in animals, helping outline a brain circuitry thought to be responsible for the acquisition, expression and extinction of fear. The findings from non-human animal research have more recently been substantiated and extended in humans, using neuropsychological and neuroimaging methodologies. Research across species concur that the neural correlates of fear conditioning include involvement of the amygdala during all stages of fear learning, and prefrontal areas during the extinction phase. This manuscript reviews how animal models of fear are translated to human behavior, and how some fears are more easily acquired in humans (i.e., social-cultural). Finally, using the knowledge provided by a rich animal literature, we attempt to extend these findings to human models targeted to helping facilitate extinction or abolishment of fears, a trademark of anxiety disorders, by discussing efficacy in modulating the brain circuitry involved in fear conditioning via pharmacological treatments or emotion regulation cognitive strategies.

Previous research in humans separately examined the mechanisms underlying acquisition and extinction of aversive and appetitive conditioned responses. It is yet unclear how aversive and appetitive learning interact on a neural level during counterconditioning in humans. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the interaction of fear conditioning and subsequent reward learning. In the first phase (fear acquisition), images predicted aversive electric shocks or no aversive outcome. In the second phase (counterconditioning), half of the CS+ and CS- were associated with monetary reward in the absence of electric stimulation. The third phase initiated reinstatement of fear through presentation of electric shocks, followed by CS presentation in the absence of shock or reward. Results indicate that participants were impaired at learning the reward contingencies for stimuli previously associated with shock. In the counterconditioning phase, prior fear association interacted with reward representation in the amygdala, where activation was decreased for rewarded compared to unrewarded CS- trials, while there was no reward-related difference in CS+ trials. In the reinstatement phase, an interaction of previous fear association and previous reward status was observed in a reward network consisting of substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), where activation was increased by previous reward association only for CS- but not for CS+ trials. These findings suggest that during counterconditioning, prior fear conditioning interferes with reward learning, subsequently leading to lower activation of the reward network.","[Bulganin, Lisa; Wittmann, Bianca C.] Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol & Sports Sci, D-35415 Giessen, Germany; [Bach, Dominik R.] Univ Zurich, Hosp Psychiat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bach, Dominik R.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England",,"Wittmann, BC (corresponding author), Univ Giessen, Dept Psychol & Sports Sci, Otto Behaghel Str 10F, D-35415 Giessen, Germany.",bianca.wittmann@psychol.uni-giessen.de,"Bach, Dominik R/B-4302-2019; Wittmann, Bianca/C-1931-2008","Bach, Dominik R/0000-0003-3717-2036; Wittmann, Bianca/0000-0002-2583-3311",Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [091593] Funding Source: Medline,,,81,13,13,0,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

Laboratory animal studies indicate that the amygdala both receives sensory information and produces learned behavioral and autonomic fear responses. However, prior functional imaging research in humans has largely focused on amygdala activity elicited by fearful stimuli giving less attention to this region's role in the production of fear responses. In contrast, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the amygdala's influence on the generation of conditional fear responses. Significant increases in amygdala activity were observed during the production of conditioned (learning-related), but not orienting, nonspecific, and unconditioned (nonlearning-related) skin conductance responses. Further, greater amygdala activity was demonstrated during conditioned response production than during conditioned stimulus presentation. These results suggest the amygdala not only responds to fearful stimuli, but also generates learning-related changes in human autonomic fear expression.

We derived pupillometry, skin conductance response and startle electromyography as well as unconditioned stimulus expectancy in a two-day fear acquisition, immediate extinction and recall task and compared an unmedicated group of patients (n = 73) with phobias or panic disorder and a group of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, n = 21) to a group of carefully screened healthy controls (n = 35).

Only the PTSD subgroup had altered startle reactions during extinction learning. Our data do not provide evidence for general differences in associative fear or extinction learning in fear-related pathologies and thereby question the diagnostic validity of the associative fear learning model of these disorders.","[Poehlchen, Dorothee; Leuchs, Laura; Binder, Florian P.; Blaskovich, Borbala; Nantawisarakul, Taechawidd; Topalidis, Pavlos; Brueckl, Tanja M.; Spoormaker, Victor, I; Binder, Elisabeth B.; Czisch, Michael; Erhardt, Angelika; Grandi, Norma C.; Ilic-Cocic, Sanja; Lucae, Susanne; Saemann, Philipp; Tontsch, Alina] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Dept Translat Res Psychiat, Kraepelinstr 2-10, D-80804 Munich, Germany; [Poehlchen, Dorothee; Binder, Florian P.] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, IMPRS TP, Munich, Germany; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Norrholm, Seth D.; Jovanovic, Tanja] Wayne State Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Detroit, MI 48207 USA; [Binder, Elisabeth B.; Czisch, Michael; Erhardt, Angelika; Grandi, Norma C.; Ilic-Cocic, Sanja; Lucae, Susanne; Saemann, Philipp; Tontsch, Alina] Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Munich, Germany",,"Spoormaker, VI (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Psychiat, Dept Translat Res Psychiat, Kraepelinstr 2-10, D-80804 Munich, Germany.",spoormaker@psych.mpg.de,"Norrholm, Seth/AAC-2464-2022; Blaskovich, Borbála/AAN-8303-2020","Topalidis, Pavlos/0000-0002-6235-060X; Blaskovich, Borbala/0000-0003-1951-2420; Binder, Florian/0000-0001-5480-7780",,,,63,7,7,2,9,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0005-7967,1873-622X,,BEHAV RES THER,Behav.

When positive, such error causes increments in associative strength and, when negative, such error causes decrements in associative strength. Prediction error can act directly on fear learning by determining the effectiveness of the aversive unconditioned stimulus or indirectly by determining the effectiveness, or associability, of the conditioned stimulus. Evidence from a variety of experimental preparations in human and non-human animals suggest that discrete neural circuits code for these actions of prediction error during fear learning. Here we review the circuits and brain regions contributing to the neural coding of prediction error during fear learning and highlight areas of research (safety learning, extinction, and reconsolidation) that may profit from this approach to understanding learning.

However, it is unknown how the endogenous ligand of GRs, corticosterone (CURT), may contribute to extinction retention deficits in the SPS model. Given that CURT synthesis during fear learning is critical for fear memory consolidation and SPS enhances GR expression, CURT synthesis during fear memory formation could strengthen fear memory in SPS rats by enhancing GR activation during fear learning. In turn, this could lead to cued fear extinction retention deficits. We tested the hypothesis that CURT synthesis during fear learning leads to cued fear extinction retention deficits in SPS rats by administering the CURT synthesis inhibitor metyrapone to SPS and control rats prior to fear conditioning, and observed the effect this had on extinction memory. Inhibiting CURT synthesis during fear memory formation in control rats tended to decrease cued freezing, though this effect never reached statistical significance. Contrary to our hypothesis, inhibiting CURT synthesis during fear memory formation disrupted extinction retention in SPS rats. This finding suggests that even though SPS exposure leads to cued fear extinction memory deficits, CURT synthesis during fear memory formation enhances extinction retention in SPS rats. This suggests that stress-induced CURT synthesis in previously stressed rats can be beneficial. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This two-phased reconsolidation process raises the prospect to directly target excessive fear memory as opposed to the formation of inhibitory memory following extinction training. In our previous studies, we convincingly demonstrated that 40 mg propranolol HCI administration before or after memory reactivation eliminated the emotional expression of fear memory indexed by the fear potentiated startle reflex. To apply this procedure in clinical practice it is important to understand the optimal and boundary conditions of this procedure. As part of a large project aimed at unraveling putative boundary conditions of disrupting reconsolidation of associative fear memory with propranolol HCI, we again tested our memory reconsolidation procedure. Participants (N = 44) underwent a three-day differential fear conditioning procedure. Twenty-four hours after fear acquisition, participants received 40 mg propranolol HCI prior to memory reactivation. The next day, participants were subjected to extinction training and reinstatement testing. In sharp contrast to our previous findings, propranolol HCI before memory reactivation did not attenuate the startle fear response. Remarkably, the startle fear response even persisted during extinction training and did not show the usually observed gradual decline in conditioned physiological responding (startle potentiation and skin conductance) upon repeated unreinforced trials. We discuss these unexpected findings and propose some potential explanations. It remains, however, unclear why we observed a resistance to reduce conditioned fear responding by either disrupting reconsolidation or extinction training. The present results underscore that the success of human fear conditioning research may depend on subtle manipulations and instructions.","[Bos, Marieke Geerte Nynke; Beckers, Tom; Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 AX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bos, Marieke Geerte Nynke; Beckers, Tom; Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Brain & Cognit, NL-1018 AX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beckers, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Leuven, Belgium",,"Kindt, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, Weesperpl 4,Room 5-11, NL-1018 AX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.kindt@uva.nl,"Beckers, Tom/C-6164-2008","Beckers, Tom/0000-0002-9581-1505; Bos, Marieke/0000-0003-1632-9217",Vici grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [453-07-006]; Vidi grant from NWO [452-09-001],"This study was funded by a Vici grant (Merel Kindt, #453-07-006) from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).

Admittance to an animal shelter is a stressful experience for dogs, and aggression is often used as a criterion by shelters for precluding opportunities for adoption. We, therefore, examined whether a program of enrichment centered around a form of human interaction known to reduce the stress of shelter dogs would also reduce the aggression of fearful dogs and improve their general welfare. Fearful dogs displaying signs of aggression, as well as dogs displaying neither fear nor aggression, either did or did not receive 30 min a day of human interaction in a secluded room for approximately the first 5 days in a shelter. We then determined the number of enriched and non-enriched fearful and non-fearful dogs that passed a standard test of dog aggression as typically implemented in this shelter to determine eligibility for adoption. We also examined the affective state of dogs in a test of cognitive bias. In two separate experiments, we found that most fearful dogs without enrichment failed the aggression test, whereas most fearful dogs undergoing enrichment completed this assessment successfully (P < 0.001 in each experiment). In contrast, nearly all non-fearful dogs passed the aggression test regardless of enrichment experience. In cognitive bias testing, enrichment reduced the latency at which fearful dogs approached two locations at which the likelihood of reinforcement was ambiguous, a measure of increased positive expectancy (P '' s < 0.01). Unexpectedly non-fearful dogs receiving enrichment approached one of the ambiguous locations more slowly than non-enriched controls (P < 0.05), a finding that might be an artifact of the testing procedures used here. While the generality of the results needs to be tested in other populations and shelter environments, the findings: 1) document the vulnerability of dogs exhibiting fear-induced aggression in a shelter environment; 2) demonstrate the ability of an enrichment program focusing on human interaction to reduce aggressiveness in these dogs and thereby increase their chances of being offered for adoption; and, 3) indicate a more-general outcome of the enrichment procedure on the affective state of fearful dogs.","[Willen, Regina M.] HaloK9Behavior, Xenia, OH 45385 USA; [Schiml, Patricia A.; Hennessy, Michael B.] Wright State Univ, Dept Psychol, Dayton, OH 45435 USA",,"Hennessy, MB (corresponding author), Wright State Univ, Dept Psychol, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",michael.hennessy@wright.edu,"Hennessy, Michael/AAH-9642-2019",,WALTHAM Foundation,"The authors thank Arielle Stephenson, Logan Riffle, and Cindy Stringer for assistance on the project, Emily Dudley for suggesting the cognitive bias test, and Mark Kumpf (Director), Estelle Johnson and Mick Sagester (Managers), and the staff of the Montgomery County Animal Resource Center for their generous continued support.

Participants performed a dot-probe task with pictures of naturally fear-relevant (snake or spider) or-irrelevant (bird or butterfly) stimuli. Instructions indicated that two pictures (one naturally fear-relevant and one fear-irrelevant) could be followed by an electrical stimulation (i.e., instructed fear). In reality, no stimulation was administered. During the task, two pictures were presented on each side of the screen, after which participants had to determine as fast as possible on which side a black dot appeared. After a first phase, fear was reinstated by instructing participants that the device was not connected but now was (reinstatement phase). Participants were faster when the dot appeared on a location where an instructed fear picture was presented. This effect seemed independent of whether picture content was naturally fear-relevant, but was only found in the first half of each phase, suggesting rapid extinction due to the absence of stimulation, and rapid re-evaluation after reinstatement. A second experiment similarly showed that instructed fear biases attention, even when participants were explicitly instructed that no stimulation would be given during the dot-probe task. Together, these findings demonstrate that attention can be biased towards instructed fear stimuli, even when these fear relations were never experienced. Future studies should test whether this is specific to fear, or can be observed for all instructions that change the relevance of a given stimulus.","[Deltomme, Berre; Braem, Senne] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Mertens, Gaetan; Braem, Senne] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Tibboel, Helen] Erasmus Univ, Dept Clin Psychol, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Braem, S (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Ghent, Belgium.; Deltomme, B (corresponding author), Dept Expt Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Berre.Deltomme@ugent.be; senne.braem@ugent.be,"Mertens, Gaëtan/ABC-3386-2021","Mertens, Gaëtan/0000-0003-1923-6657; Tibboel, Helen/0000-0002-0552-9574; Braem, Senne/0000-0002-2619-8225",FWO - Research Foundation FlandersFWO [12K6316N]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme - Belgian Science Policy OfficeBelgian Federal Science Policy Office [IUAPVII/33]; Research Foundation FlandersFWO [G.0231.13N]; Ghent UniversityGhent University [BOF09/01M00209],"S.B. is supported by FWO - Research Foundation Flanders (12K6316N).

However, the impact of such competing rewards on fear and avoidance acquisition has rarely been investigated. During acquisition, participants chose between one option (CS + option) associated with a neutral stimulus followed by an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) and another option (CS - option) associated with another neutral stimulus followed by no US (N = 223 randomized into three groups). In a subsequent test, no more USs occurred. In one group, competing rewards were established by linking the CS + option to high rewards and the CS - option to low rewards during acquisition and test (Reward Group). In a second group, rewards were present during acquisition, but discontinued during test (Initial-Reward Group). In a third group, rewards were completely absent (No-Reward Group). Without competing rewards, significant avoidance was acquired and persisted in the absence of the US. Competing rewards attenuated avoidance acquisition already after the first experience of the aversive US. Avoidance remained attenuated even when rewards were discontinued during test. Rewards did, however, not change the level of fear responses to the CS+ (US expectancy, skin conductance). Finally, rewards did not change the level of fear reduction during test, which was, however, experienced earlier. Summarized, rewards for approaching aversive events do not buffer fear acquisition, but can prevent avoidance. This damping of avoidance may initiate fear extinction.","[Pittig, Andre] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol Biol Psychol Clin Psychol & Psychoth, Wurzburg, Germany; [Pittig, Andre; Dehler, Jule] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Dresden, Germany; [Pittig, Andre] Univ Wurzburg, Ctr Mental Hlth, Wurzburg, Germany",,"Pittig, A (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 1, Marcusstr 9-11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",andre.pittig@uni-wuerzburg.de,"Pittig, Andre/L-1570-2016","Pittig, Andre/0000-0003-3787-9576",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [PI1269/2-1 - 389569971],"This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) grant PI1269/2-1 - 389569971 to AP.

Healthy adolescents (mean age 16.26) and adults (mean age 29.85) completed a fear learning paradigm across two stages during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Stage 1 involved conditioning and extinction, and stage 2 involved extinction recall, re-conditioning, followed by re-extinction. During extinction recall, we observed a higher skin conductance response to the CS+ relative to CS-in adolescents compared to adults, which was accompanied by a reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity. Relative to adults, adolescents also had significantly reduced activation in the ventromedial PFC, dlPFC, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during extinction recall compared to late extinction. Age differences in PCC activation between late extinction and late conditioning were also observed. These results show for the first time that healthy adolescent humans show different behavioral responses, and dampened PFC activity during short-term extinction recall compared to healthy adults. We also identify the PCC and TPJ as novel regions that may be associated with impaired extinction in adolescents. Also, while adults showed significant correlations between differential SCR and BOLD activity in some brain regions during late extinction and recall, adolescents did not show any significant correlations. This study highlights adolescent-specific neural correlates of extinction, which may explain the peak in prevalence of anxiety disorders during adolescence.","[Ganella, Despina E.; Drummond, Katherine D.; Kim, Jee Hyun] Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Behav Neurosci Div, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Ganella, Despina E.; Drummond, Katherine D.; Kim, Jee Hyun] Univ Melbourne, Florey Dept Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Ganella, Eleni P.; Whittle, Sarah] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Neuropsychiat Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Ganella, Eleni P.; Whittle, Sarah] Melbourne Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Kim, JH (corresponding author), Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Behav Neurosci Div, Parkville, Vic, Australia.; Kim, JH (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Florey Dept Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",drjeehyunkim@gmail.com,"Whittle, Sarah/I-2200-2014; Kim, Jee Hyun/F-8777-2012","Whittle, Sarah/0000-0003-3145-1528; Kim, Jee Hyun/0000-0002-1299-4300; Drummond, Katherine Dawn/0000-0002-6534-7676",Baker Foundation Fellowship; University of MelbourneUniversity of Melbourne [603406]; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1125504]; NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1083309],"This work was supported by a Baker Foundation Fellowship and The University of Melbourne Early Career Researcher (ECR) grant (603406) awarded to DG, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Career Development Fellowship (APP1125504) awarded to SW, and NHMRC Career Development Fellowship (APP1083309) awarded to JK.

Life-threatening events like escaping a predator can have enduring, even lifelong, effects on the brain, and new interdisciplinary research on the neurobiology of fear in wild animals is both providing insights into post-traumatic stress (PTSD) and reinforcing the likely commonality of population- and community-level effects of fear in nature.

Exposure to sweat produced in a fear-inducing context triggers in its receivers a simulacrum of this emotional state, as evidenced by increased medial frontalis and corrugator supercilii (facial electromyography; fEMG) activity - two facial muscles involved in the display of fear facial expressions. However, despite the increased interest in the effects of emotional sweat, little is known about the properties of these chemical sweat samples. The goal of this study was to examine whether a second application of the same sweat sample would yield reliable results. Specifically, we assessed whether sweat samples collected from Portuguese males (N = 8) in fear (vs. neutral)-inducing contexts would produce similar fEMG activations (i.e., in the medial frontalis and corrugator supercilii) in female receivers (N = 60) across two independent applications (the first with Dutch and the second with Portuguese receivers). Our findings showed that exposure to fear (vs. neutral) sweat resulted in higher activation of both muscles compared with neutral odors, revealing a similar data pattern across the two applications and underlining the feasibility of reusing emotional sweat samples. The implications of these findings for properties of these sweat volatiles are discussed.","[Gomes, Nuno; Semin, Gun R.] ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim do Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva, Fabio] Univ Aveiro, William James Ctr Res, Dept Educ & Psychol, Aveiro, Portugal; [Semin, Gun R.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Semin, GR (corresponding author), ISPA Inst Univ, William James Ctr Res, Rua Jardim do Tabaco 34, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal.; Semin, GR (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands.",gun.r.semin@gmail.com,"Semin, Gun/J-4046-2013","Semin, Gun/0000-0002-5304-5566; Gomes, Nuno/0000-0002-0545-607X","Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/116653/2016, IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001]; European Union Horizon 2020 Program under the project POTION-Promoting Social Interaction through Emotional Body Odors [824153]",NG and GRS gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (grant ref: SFRH/BD/116653/2016 to NG; and grant ref: IF/00085/2013/CP1186/CT0001 to GRS).

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that regions involved in the acquisition of fear support the generalization of fear to stimuli that are similar to a learned threat, but vary in fear intensity value. Behaviorally, subjects retrospectively misidentified a learned threat as a more intense stimulus and expressed greater skin conductance responses (SCR) to generalized stimuli of high intensity. Brain activity related to intensity-based fear generalization was observed in the striatum, insula, thalamus/periacqueductal gray, and subgenual cingulate cortex. The psychophysiological expression of generalized fear correlated with amygdala activity, and connectivity between the amygdala and extrastriate visual cortex was correlated with individual differences in trait anxiety. These findings reveal the brain regions and functional networks involved in flexibly responding to stimuli that resemble a learned threat. These regions may comprise an intensity-based fear generalization circuit that underlies retrospective biases in threat value estimation and overgeneralization of fear in anxiety disorders.

A defense mode observed at intermediate threat levels is freezing: a cessation of locomotion that is characterized by a parasympathetically dominated autonomic nervous system response that causes heart rate deceleration, or fear bradycardia. Studies in rodents have shown that freezing depends on amygdalar projections to the periaqueductal grey (PAG). In humans, freezing-like behaviors are implicated in development and maintenance of psychopathology, but neural mechanisms underlying freezing or its characteristic autonomic response profile have not been identified. Here, we combined event-related blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) with autonomic response measures in a picture viewing paradigm to probe activity and interconnectivity within the amygdala-PAG pathway and test for an association with parasympathetic as opposed to sympathetic activation. In response to negatively arousing pictures, we observed parasympathetic (bradycardia) and sympathetic (pupil dilation) autonomic responses, BOLD responses in the amygdala and PAG, and effective connectivity between these regions. Critically, BOLD responses in the PAG to negative pictures correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with bradycardia but not pupil dilation. This correlation with bradycardia remained significant when partialling out pupil dilation. Additionally, activity in regions associated with motor planning and inhibition mirrored the PAG response. Thus, our findings implicate the human PAG in a parasympathetically dominated defense mode that subserves a state of attentive immobility. Mechanistic insight into this qualitatively distinct defense mode may importantly advance translational models of anxiety disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

While NMDARs mediate opposite effects on medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons and excitatory neurons. NMDAR antagonists trigger profound cortical activation. The objectives of the present study were to determine the involvement of NMDARs expressed specifically in excitatory neurons in mPFC-dependent adaptive behaviors, specifically fear discrimination and fear extinction. To achieve this, we tested mice with locally deleted Grin1 gene encoding the obligatory NR1 subunit of the NMDAR from prefrontal CamKII alpha positive neurons for their ability to distinguish frequency modulated (FM) tones in fear discrimination test. We demonstrated that NMDAR-dependent signaling in the mPFC is critical for effective fear discrimination following initial generalization of conditioned fear. While mice with deficient NMDARs in prefrontal excitatory neurons maintain normal responses to a dangerous fear-conditioned stimulus, they exhibit abnormal generalization decrement. These studies provide evidence that NMDAR-dependent neural signaling in the mPFC is a component of a neural mechanism for disambiguating the meaning of fear signals and supports discriminative fear learning by retaining proper gating information, viz both dangerous and harmless cues. We also found that selective deletion of NMDARs from excitatory neurons in the mPFC leads to a deficit in fear extinction of auditory conditioned stimuli. These studies suggest that prefrontal NMDARs expressed in excitatory neurons are involved in adaptive behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The following self-reported measures were used: risk of victimisation and FOC scales, a general (noncrime) fear scale measuring pragmatic fear, and a community concern scale. Data were analysed using path analysis, Sobel tests, and multiple group analysis. Findings revealed that perceived crime and incivilities significantly predicted FOC, whereas infrastructure was insignificant as a direct predictor. Females had higher FOC, and among ethnic groups, Indo-Trinidadians had the highest FOC than Afro-Trinidadians and Mixed participants.

We hypothesized that ii animals recognized a man or a sheep in the presented slides, fear reactions would be enhanced in the presence of the picture of a human and reduced in the presence of a sheep picture as compared with the control situation. Our results suggest that ewes may be able to recognize the sheep picture as a conspecific. For example, sniffings were primarily directed towards the anogenital region and the head. The reduced fear reactions of isolated ewes in the presence of a sheep picture is similar to that observed previously in the presence of real conspecifics. In contrast, they did not differ when sheep were confronted with a human or a control image, indicating that additional stimuli may be needed for the human image to be fear-eliciting.","INRA, CTR TOURS NOUZILLY, ETUD COMPORTEMENT ANIM LAB, F-37380 NOUZILLY, FRANCE",,,,,,,,,43,21,21,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-6357,1872-8308,,BEHAV PROCESS,Behav.

The concept of the landscape of fear has recently become central to describing this spatial variation in risk, perception, and response. We present a framework linking the landscape of fear, defined as spatial variation in prey perception of risk, to the underlying physical landscape and predation risk, and to resulting patterns of prey distribution and antipredator behavior. By disambiguating the mechanisms through which prey perceive risk and incorporate fear into decision making, we can better quantify the nonlinear relationship between risk and response and evaluate the relative importance of the landscape of fear across taxa and ecosystems.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Middleton, Arthur D.; Brashares, Justin S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall 3114, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, 845 West Taylor St MC 066, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Integrated Math Oncol, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Power, Mary E.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 3060 Valley Life Sci Bldg 3140, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Gaynor, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall 3114, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kgaynor@berkeley.edu,,"Gaynor, Kaitlyn/0000-0002-5747-0543",NSF GRFP grantNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD),"This work was supported by an NSF GRFP grant to K.M.G.

It has been observed that fear conditioning depends on stimulus salience and subject vulnerability to fear. It is further known that the prevalence of dental-related fear and phobia is exceedingly high in the population. Dental phobia is unique as no other body part is associated with a specific phobia. Therefore, we hypothesized that painful dental stimuli exhibit an enhanced susceptibility to fear conditioning when comparing to equal perceived stimuli applied to other body sites. Differential susceptibility to pain-related fear was investigated by analyzing responses to an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) applied to the right maxillary canine (UCS-c) vs. the right tibia (UCS-t). For fear conditioning, UCS-c and USC-t consisted of painful electric stimuli, carefully matched at both application sites for equal intensity and quality perception. UCSs were paired to simple geometrical forms which served as conditioned stimuli (CS+). Unpaired CS+ were presented for eliciting and analyzing conditioned fear responses. Outcome parameter were (1) skin conductance changes and (2) time-dependent brain activity (BOLD responses) in fear-related brain regions such as the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. A preferential susceptibility of dental pain to fear conditioning was observed, reflected by heightened skin conductance responses and enhanced time-dependent brain activity (BOLD responses) in the fear network. For the first time, this study demonstrates fear-related neurobiological mechanisms that point toward a superior conditionability of tooth pain. Beside traumatic dental experiences our results offer novel evidence that might explain the high prevalence of dental-related fears in the population.","[Meier, Michael L.; de Matos, Nuno M.

Therefore, there is substantial scientific and medical interest in its potential therapeutic use for the treatment of psychopathologies associated with anxiety, fear, and social dysfunctions, such as generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder, as well as autism and schizophrenia, among others. Focusing on preclinical studies, we review the existing evidence for the regulatory capacity of OXT to fine-tune general and social anxiety-related behaviors, as well as cued and social fear conditioning from a translational perspective. The available evidence from animal and human studies substantiates the hypothesis of an imbalance of the endogenous brain OXT system in the etiology of anxiety disorders, particularly those with a social component such as social anxiety disorder. In addition, such an imbalance of the OXT system is also likely to be the consequence of chronic OXT treatment resulting in a dose-dependent reduction in OXT receptor availability and increased anxiety.","[Neumann, Inga D.; Slattery, David A.] Univ Regensburg, Dept Behav & Mol Neurobiol, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany",,"Neumann, ID (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Behav & Mol Neurobiol, Univ Str 31, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",inga.neumann@ur.de,,"Slattery, David/0000-0001-8753-5005",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und ForschungFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Elitenetwork of Bavaria; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG),"This work was supported by the European Research Council, Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Elitenetwork of Bavaria (IDN), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (IDN, DAS).",,117,242,246,6,110,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

In both rodents and humans, BDNF has been implicated in hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning and memory and has more recently been linked to fear extinction processes. Fifty-nine healthy participants, genotyped for the functional BDNFval66met polymorphism, underwent a fear conditioning and 24h-delayed extinction protocol while skin conductance and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses (functional magnetic resonance imaging) were acquired. We present the first report of neural activation pattern during fear acquisition 'and' extinction for the BDNFval66met polymorphism using a differential conditioned stimulus (CS)+ > CS- comparison. During conditioning, we observed heightened allele dose-dependent responses in the amygdala and reduced responses in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in BDNFval66met met-carriers. During early extinction, 24h later, we again observed heightened responses in several regions ascribed to the fear network in met-carriers as opposed to val-carriers (insula, amygdala, hippocampus), which likely reflects fear memory recall. No differences were observed during late extinction, which likely reflects learned extinction. Our data thus support previous associations of the BDNFval66met polymorphism with neural activation in the fear and extinction network, but speak against a specific association with fear extinction processes.","[Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Haaker, Jan] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Golkar, Armita; Lindstrom, Kara M.; Haaker, Jan; Ohman, Arne; Ingvar, Martin] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Golkar, Armita; Ohman, Arne; Ingvar, Martin] Stockholm Brain Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Schalling, Martin] Karolinska Inst, Dept Mol Med & Surg, Neurogenet Sect, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lonsdorf, Tina B.; Schalling, Martin] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Ctr Mol Med, Solna, Sweden",,"Lonsdorf, TB (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Syst Neurosci, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",t.lonsdorf@uke.de,"Lonsdorf, Tina/K-8657-2017; Schalling, Martin/F-1518-2015; Haaker, Jan/J-4670-2014","Schalling, Martin/0000-0001-5011-2922; Lonsdorf, Tina/0000-0003-1501-4846; Golkar, Armita/0000-0003-3077-0391; Ingvar, Martin/0000-0002-9041-5714; Haaker, Jan/0000-0001-8366-9559",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Karolinska InstitutetKarolinska Institutet; Stockholm County Concil; Karolinska University HospitalKarolinska Institutet; Hjarnfonden (Swedish Brain Foundation);  [SFB TRR58],"The authors thank the KIgene core facility at the Center for Molecular Medicine (CMM).

However, the link between the two features of this disorder is not well understood. In order to probe the brain basis of aberrant extinction learning in PTSD, we administered a multimodal classical fear conditioning/extinction paradigm that incorporated affectively relevant information from two sensory channels (visual and tactile) while participants underwent fMRI scanning. The sample consisted of fifteen OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD. In response to conditioned cues and contextual information, greater avoidance symptomatology was associated with greater activation in amygdala, hippocampus, vmPFC, dmPFC, and insula, during both fear acquisition and fear extinction. Heightened responses to previously conditioned stimuli in individuals with more severe PTSD could indicate a deficiency in safety learning, consistent with PTSD symptomatology. The close link between avoidance symptoms and fear circuit activation suggests that this symptom cluster may be a key component of fear extinction deficits in PTSD and/or may be particularly amenable to change through extinction-based therapies.","[Sripada, Rebecca K.; Liberzon, Israel] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sripada, Rebecca K.] Vet Affairs Ctr Clin Management Res, Dept Vet Affairs Healthcare Syst, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Garfinkel, Sarah N.] Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",,"Sripada, RK (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, 4250 Plymouth Rd,2702 Rachel Upjohn Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rekaufma@umich.edu,,"Sripada, Rebecca/0000-0002-2844-3458; Garfinkel, Sarah/0000-0002-5961-1012; Liberzon, Israel/0000-0002-4990-556X",Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research [U028028]; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R24 MH075999]; Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center [W81XWH-08-2-0208],"The research reported in this article was supported by grants from the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (U028028) to SG, from the National Institute of Mental Health (R24 MH075999) to IL, and from the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (W81XWH-08-2-0208) to IL.",,69,44,45,0,37,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,,,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

However, recalling traumatic memories can induce re-experiencing the trauma, thus resulting in a maladaptive fear. A failure to properly regulate fear responses has been associated with anxiety disorders, like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Thus, re-establishing the capability to regulate fear has an important role for its adaptive and clinical relevance. Strategies aimed at erasing fear memories have been proposed, although there are limits about their efficiency in treating anxiety disorders. To re-establish fear regulation, here we propose a new approach, based on the re-evaluation of the aversive value of traumatic experience. Mice were submitted to a contextual-fear-conditioning paradigm in which a neutral context was paired with an intense electric footshock. Three weeks after acquisition, conditioned mice were treated with a less intense footshock (pain threshold). The effectiveness of this procedure in reducing fear expression was assessed in terms of behavioral outcomes related to PTSD (e.g., hyper-reactivity to a neutral tone, anxiety levels in a plus maze task, social avoidance, and learning deficits in a spatial water maze) and of amygdala activity by evaluating c-fos expression. Furthermore, a possible role of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (IOFC) in mediating the behavioral effects induced by the re-evaluation procedure was investigated. We observed that this treatment: (i) significantly mitigates the abnormal behavioral outcomes induced by trauma; (ii) persistently attenuates fear expression without erasing contextual memory; (iii) prevents fear reinstatement; (iv) reduces amygdala activity; and (v) requires an intact IOFC to be effective. These results suggest that an effective strategy to treat pathological anxiety should address cognitive re-evaluation of the traumatic experience mediated by IOFC.","[Costanzi, Marco; Saraulli, Daniele; Cannas, Sara; D'Alessandro, Francesca; Cestari, Vincenzo] CNR IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, IBCN, Rome, Italy; [Costanzi, Marco; D'Alessandro, Francesca] Libera Univ Maria SS, Dept Human Sci, Rome, Italy; [Saraulli, Daniele; Rossi-Arnaud, Clelia; Cestari, Vincenzo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Psychol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Florenzano, Fulvio] EBRI, Confocal Microscopy Unit, Rome, Italy; [Cestari, Vincenzo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Daniel Bovet Ctr, I-00185 Rome, Italy",,"Cestari, V (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Psychol, Via Marsi 78, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",vincenzo.cestari@uniroma1.it,"ROSSI-ARNAUD, Clelia/J-7870-2019","ROSSI-ARNAUD, Clelia/0000-0001-5006-6583; Cestari, Vincenzo/0000-0002-9623-157X",LUMSA; Guardia di Finanza-Italian Ministry of Economy,"We thank R W.

Yet, recent findings in rodents have challenged the notion that contextual fear retention is initially generalized. The context-specificity of a cued fear memory to the learning context has not been addressed in the human literature largely due to limitations in methodology. Here we adapt a novel technology to test the context-specificity of cued fear conditioning using full immersion 3-D virtual reality (VR). During acquisition training, healthy participants navigated through virtual environments containing dynamic snake and spider conditioned stimuli (CSs), one of which was paired with electrical wrist stimulation. During a 24-h delayed retention test, one group returned to the same context as acquisition training whereas another group experienced the CSs in a novel context. Unconditioned stimulus expectancy ratings were assayed on-line during fear acquisition as an index of contingency awareness. Skin conductance responses time-locked to CS onset were the dependent measure of cued fear, and skin conductance levels during the interstimulus interval were an index of context fear. Findings indicate that early in acquisition training, participants express contingency awareness as well as differential contextual fear, whereas differential cued fear emerged later in acquisition. During the retention test, differential cued fear retention was enhanced in the group who returned to the same context as acquisition training relative to the context shift group. The results extend recent rodent work to illustrate differences in cued and context fear acquisition and the contextual specificity of recent fear memories. Findings support the use of full immersion VR as a novel tool in cognitive neuroscience to bridge rodent models of contextual phenomena underlying human clinical disorders.","[Huff, Nicole C.; Hernandez, Jose Alba; Fecteau, Matthew E.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Psychol Neurosci Dept, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Zielinski, David J.; Brady, Rachael] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Labar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Box 90999,B247 LSRC Bldg,Res Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",klabar@duke.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [F32 MH078471, RO1 DA027802]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [R01DA027802] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors wish to thank Christian Paret for assistance with scoring the skin conductance data.

Human studies on such reinstatement processes are still inconclusive. Some revealed a general increase of fear reactions, both to the fear (CS+) and the safety stimulus (CS-), whereas other studies discovered a differential return of fear with enhanced fear responses to the CS+ only. Moreover, we know little about reinstatement of contextual anxiety, a state of general anxious apprehension and chronic worry. Therefore, the present study investigated reinstatement of contextual anxiety with an ecological valid virtual reality (VR) design. Additionally, we examined whether the current state anxiety might modulate the reinstatement of contextual anxiety. To this end, two groups underwent context conditioning on Day 1, i.e., one context (CXT+) became paired with unpredictable USs, but not the other context (CXT-), and an extinction training on Day 2. On Day 3 a reinstatement test was conducted, i.e., one group (reinstatement group, n = 21) received one unsignaled US before testing, whereas the control group (n = 21) did not. Only the reinstatement group showed a differential return of contextual anxiety as measured by fear-potentiated startle and anxiety ratings. Interestingly, the reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle was additionally influenced by state anxiety. Conclusively, an anxious state before an unsignaled aversive event might favor a return of contextual anxiety. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Animal models of reinstatement commonly utilize a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure, in which subjects are first trained to fear a conditional stimulus (CS) by pairing it with an aversive unconditional stimulus (US), and then extinguished by repeated presentations of the CS alone. Reinstatement is typically induced by exposing subjects to an aversive US after extinction, but here we show that exposure to a non-extinguished CS can reinstate conditional fear responding to an extinguished CS, a phenomenon we refer to as conditional reinstatement (CRI). Rats were trained to fear two CSs (light and tone) and subsequently underwent extinction training to only one CS (counterbalanced). Presenting the unextinguished CS (but not a novel cue) immediately after extinction reinstated conditional fear responding to the extinguished CS in a test session given 24 h later. These findings indicate that reinstatement of extinguished fear can be triggered by exposure to conditional as well as unconditional aversive stimuli, and this may help to explain why relapse is common following clinical extinction therapy in humans. Further study of CRI using animal models may prove useful for developing refined extinction therapies that are more resistant to reinstatement.","[Halladay, Lindsay R.; Zelikowsky, Moriel; Blair, Hugh T.; Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Fanselow, Michael S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Halladay, LR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",lrhalladay@ucla.edu,"Halladay, Lindsay/AAC-9950-2020","Halladay, Lindsay/0000-0003-2232-6709; Zelikowsky, Moriel/0000-0002-0465-9027; Blair, Hugh/0000-0001-8256-5109",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5 T32 NS058280-03]; NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [RO1 MH62122]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH062122] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [T32NS058280] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This work was supported by NIH Grant 5 T32 NS058280-03 awarded to Lindsay R.

Extinction re-test was examined on Day 3 using the original acquisition CS duration (2 mm). Findings indicated that participants who were aware of the CS+/unconditioned stimulus (US) contingency (n = 52) develop a temporal expectation about when the unconditioned stimulus will be delivered. Although the shorter duration CS resulted in greater fear reduction during extinction, cessation of fear responding at re-test was the same for CS extinction durations ranging from half the CS acquisition duration to twice the CS acquisition duration.

Unfortunately, only one human neuroimaging study of classically conditioned fear generalization has been conducted, and the neural substrates of this clinically germane process remain largely unknown. The current generalization study employs a clinically validated generalization gradient paradigm, modified for the fMRI environment, to identify neural substrates of classically conditioned generalization that may function aberrantly in clinical anxiety. Stimuli include five rings of gradually increasing size with extreme sizes serving as cues of conditioned danger (CS+) and safety (CS-). The three intermediately sized rings serve as generalization stimuli (GSs) and create a continuum-of-size from CS+ to CS-. Results demonstrate 'positive' generalization gradients, reflected by declines in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+, in bilateral anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobule. Conversely, 'negative' gradients, reflected by inclines in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+ were instantiated in bilateral ventral hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus cortex.

In contrast, supernatural fears do not involve direct experience but seem to be related to sensory or cognitive biases in the interpretation of stimuli as well as culturally driven cognitions and beliefs. In this multidisciplinary synthesis and collaborative review, we claim that supernatural beliefs are super natural. That is, they occur spontaneously and are easy to acquire, possibly because such beliefs rest on intuitive concepts such as mind-body dualism and animism, and may inspire fear in believers as well as non-believers. As suggested by psychological and neuroscientific evidence, they tap into an evolutionarily prepared fear of potential impending dangers or unknown objects and have their roots in prepared fears as well as cognitively prepared beliefs, making fear of supernatural agents a fruitful research avenue for social, anthropological, and psychological inquires.","[Coelho, Carlos M.; Suttiwan, Panrapee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Zsido, Andras N.] Univ Pecs, Inst Psychol, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary; [Clasen, Mathias] Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Coelho, Carlos M.] Univ Inst Maia, Maia, Portugal; [Coelho, Carlos M.] Univ Porto, Ctr Psychol, Porto, Portugal; [Suttiwan, Panrapee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Life Di Ctr, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",,"Suttiwan, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.; Suttiwan, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Psychol, Life Di Ctr, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",panrapee.s@chula.ac.th,"; Coelho, Carlos/A-5065-2010","Clasen, Mathias/0000-0003-0830-0078; Zsido, Andras/0000-0003-0506-6861; Coelho, Carlos/0000-0002-2320-7931","Rachadapisek Sompote Fund for Postdoctoral Fellowship, Chulalongkorn University; Foundation for Science and Technology PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [FCT UIDB/00050/2020]; European UnionEuropean Commission; European Social Fund Comprehensive Development for Implementing Smart Specialization Strategies at the University of Pecs [EFOP-3.6.1.-16-2016-00004]; New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Innovation and Technology [UNKP-20-4]; Independent Research Fund Denmark [0132-00204B]; Center for Psychology at the University of Porto","Carlos M.

After fear conditioning, participants underwent extinction training either 5 min or 1 day later and in either the same room (same context) or a different room (context shift). The next day, conditioned fear was tested in the original room. When extinction took place immediately, fear renewal was robust and prolonged for context-shift participants, and spontaneous recovery was observed in the same-context participants. Delayed extinction, by contrast, yielded a brief form of fear renewal that reextinguished within the testing session for context-shift participants, and there was no spontaneous recovery in the same-context participants. The authors conclude that the passage of time allows for memory consolidation processes to promote the formation of distinct yet flexible emotional memory traces that confer an ability to recall extinction, even in an alternate context, and minimize the return of fear. Furthermore, immediate extinction can yield spontaneous recovery and prolong fear renewal. These findings have potential implications for ameliorating fear relapse in anxiety disorders.","[Huff, Nicole C.; Hernandez, Jose Alba; Blanding, Nineequa Q.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Labar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",klabar@duke.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0239614]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [2 P01 NS041328, F32 MH078471]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH078471] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [P01NS041328] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported in pan by National Science Foundation CAREER award 0239614 to Kevin S.

Because fear can evidently affect the populations of terrestrial vertebrates, we proposed a predator-prey model incorporating the cost of fear into prey reproduction. Our mathematical analyses show that high levels of fear (or equivalently strong anti-predator responses) can stabilize the predator-prey system by excluding the existence of periodic solutions. However, relatively low levels of fear can induce multiple limit cycles via subcritical Hopf bifurcations, leading to a bi-stability phenomenon. Compared to classic predator-prey models which ignore the cost of fear where Hopf bifurcations are typically supercritical, Hopf bifurcations in our model can be both supercritical and subcritical by choosing different sets of parameters. We conducted numerical simulations to explore the relationships between fear effects and other biologically related parameters (e.g. birth/death rate of adult prey), which further demonstrate the impact that fear can have in predator-prey interactions. For example, we found that under the conditions of a Hopf bifurcation, an increase in the level of fear may alter the direction of Hopf bifurcation from supercritical to subcritical when the birth rate of prey increases accordingly. Our simulations also show that the prey is less sensitive in perceiving predation risk with increasing birth rate of prey or increasing death rate of predators, but demonstrate that animals will mount stronger anti-predator defences as the attack rate of predators increases.","[Wang, Xiaoying; Zou, Xingfu] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Appl Math, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Zanette, Liana] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada",,"Zou, XF (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Appl Math, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",xzou@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,Research partially supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,48,133,139,11,75,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0303-6812,1432-1416,,J MATH BIOL,J.

Studies have shown that the number of traumatic events experienced is positively related to the severity of post traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders. Using a contextual fear conditioning (Cond1) and reconditioning (Cond2) paradigm, which were separated by either 1 or 35 days, we examined fear responses to immediate extinction and retrieval-extinction procedures after repeated fear conditioning stress. Based on the time interval between Cond1 and Cond2, the animals were divided into recent and remote fear memory groups. We observed that when Cond2 was performed in the original conditioning context in which Cond1 was performed, the reconditioned remote fear memory was resistant to the disruptive effect of immediate extinction and retrieval-extinction paradigms. Furthermore, the resistance to disruptive effects could be induced by very low shock intensities, which cannot even induce any fear response in naive animals. When Cond2 was performed in a novel context, animals with remote fear memory acquired a significantly higher fear response to the novel context. Our findings suggest that remote fear memory may be more sensitive to reconditioning and resistant to post-reconditioning disruption.","[An, Xianli; Zhang, Fenfen; Liu, Yuan; Yang, Ping] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [An, Xianli; Yu, Duonan] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Med, Jiangsu Key Lab Expt & Translat Noncoding RNA Res, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Duonan] Yangzhou Univ, Inst Comparat Med, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Duonan] Jiangsu Coinnovat Ctr Prevent & Control Important, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Yu, DN (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Expt & Translat Noncoding RNA Res, 11 Huaihai Rd, Yangzhou 225001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dnyu@yzu.edu.cn,"Liu, Yuan/AAN-8588-2021",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31400879]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M621827]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution (Veterinary Medicine); High Level Innovation & Entrepreneurship Program of Jiangsu Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 31400879, to XA), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant number 2017M621827, to XA), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institution (Veterinary Medicine, to DY), and the High Level Innovation & Entrepreneurship Program of Jiangsu Province (DY).",,56,0,0,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4328,1872-7549,,BEHAV BRAIN RES,Behav.

Our goal was to determine if these previous results found in animals can be reproduced in humans. Twenty-two healthy participants took part in a classical fear conditioning, extinction, and extinction recall paradigm. Behavioral responses (fear expectations) as well as psychophysiological measures (skin conductance responses, SCRs) were recorded. The results showed a significant fear expectation decrease during fear extinction with BLS. Additionally, SCR for fear extinction retrieval were significantly lower with BLS.

Recently, we demonstrated that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is capable of enhancing fear memories. Here, we examined the effects of cathodal tDCS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during fear reconsolidation in humans. Methods: Seventeen young, healthy subjects were randomly assigned to two groups, which underwent fear conditioning with mild electric stimuli paired with a visual stimulus. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were shown a reminder of the conditioned fearful stimulus. Shortly thereafter, they received either tDCS (right prefrontal-cathodal, left supraorbital-anodal) for 20 min at 1 mA, or sham stimulation. A day later, fear responses of both groups were compared. Results: On Day 3, during fear response assessment, there were no significant differences between the tDCS and sham group (p > 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that cathodal tDCS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right prefrontal-cathodal, left supraorbital-anodal) did not influence fear memories.","[Mungee, Aditya; Burger, Max; Bajbouj, Malek] Charite, Dept Psychiat, Campus Benjamin Franklin, D-14050 Berlin, Germany; [Mungee, Aditya; Bajbouj, Malek] Freie Univ, Cluster Excellence Languages Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Bajbouj, Malek] Freie Univ, Dahlem Inst Neuroimaging Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",,"Mungee, A (corresponding author), Charite, Dept Psychiat, Campus Benjamin Franklin, D-14050 Berlin, Germany.; Mungee, A (corresponding author), Freie Univ, Cluster Excellence Languages Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",aditya.mungee@charite.de; max-benedict.burger@charite.de; malek.bajbouj@charite.de,"Bajbouj, Malek/B-3579-2012; Bajbouj, Malek/ABD-6241-2021","Bajbouj, Malek/0000-0002-0073-3322",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Charite Medical Neuroscience Program; DFG (German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG),"The authors would like to thank the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), Charite Medical Neuroscience Program and the DFG (German Research Foundation) funded cluster of excellence Languages of Emotion for supporting this project.

Heightened conditioned fear expression may be a prospective risk factor for the development of human anxiety and trauma disorders. However, the relationship between conditioned fear expression and FGF2 is yet to be established in humans. METHODS: Using a cross-species approach, we first investigated the relationship between serum concentrations of FGF2 and individual differences in conditioned fear expression in rats (n = 19). We then subjected 88 human participants, who were recruited from university and community advertisements, to a differential fear conditioning procedure and assessed the relationship between salivary concentrations of FGF2 and fear expression to a conditioned stimulus (CS) (a stimulus paired with a shock) and a CS that was never paired with shock. RESULTS: Rats with low serum levels of FGF2 exhibited significantly more freezing than rats with high serum levels of FGF2. Similarly, relative to those with high salivary FGF2, human participants with low salivary FGF2 exhibited significantly heightened skin conductance responses to the CS without shock during fear conditioning and to both the CS with shock and CS without shock during fear recall. CONCLUSIONS: These studies establish that peripheral markers of FGF2 concentrations are negatively associated with fear expression in both rats and humans. To the extent that conditioned fear expression predicts anxiety and trauma disorder vulnerability, FGF2 may be a clinically useful biomarker in the prediction and eventual prevention of these disorders.","[Graham, Bronwyn M.; Zagic, Dino; Richardson, Rick] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,"Graham, BM (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",bgraham@psy.unsw.edu.au,,"Graham, Bronwyn/0000-0001-6582-2273","Goldstar Award and a Silverstar Award, from the University of New South Wales; Discovery Early Career Research Award from the Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE140100243]","This work was supported by a Goldstar Award and a Silverstar Award, both from the University of New South Wales (to BMG and RR) and by a Discovery Early Career Research Award from the Australian Research Council (DE140100243) to BMG.

Usually, these learning experiences are modeled in the lab with pairings between a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) (i. e., fear conditioning via CS-US pairings). Nevertheless, for humans, fear learning can also be based on verbal instructions. In this review, we consider the role of verbal instructions in laboratory fear learning. Specifically, we consider both the effects of verbal instructions on fear responses in the absence of CS-US pairings as well as the way in which verbal instructions moderate fear established via CS-US pairings. We first focus on the available empirical findings about both types of effects. More specifically, we consider how these effects are moderated by elements of the fear conditioning procedure (i.e., the stimuli, the outcome measures, the relationship between the stimuli, the participants, and the broader context). Thereafter, we discuss how well different mental-process models of fear learning account for these empirical findings.

Here we investigated sex differences in, and the influence of estradiol and progesterone on, fear extinction in healthy humans. Men and women underwent a two-day paradigm in which fear conditioning and extinction learning took place on day 1 and extinction recall was tested on day 2. Visual cues were used as the conditioned stimuli and a mild electric shock was used as the unconditioned stimulus. Skin conductance was recorded throughout the experiment and used to measure conditioned responses (CRs). Blood samples were obtained from all women to measure estradiol and progesterone levels. We found that higher estradiol during extinction learning enhanced subsequent extinction recall but had no effects on fear acquisition or extinction learning itself. Sex differences were only observed during acquisition, with men exhibiting significantly higher CRs. After dividing women into low- and high-estradiol groups, men showed comparable extinction recall to high-estradiol women, and both of these groups showed higher extinction recall than low-estradiol women. Therefore, sex differences in extinction memory emerged only after taking into account women's estradiol levels. Lower estradiol may impair extinction consolidation in women. These findings could have practical applications in the treatment of anxiety disorders through cognitive and behavioral therapies. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Newborn New Zealand rabbit pups were exposed to one of the following handling treatments in the first week of life: (1) full handling, within 0.5 It after nursing, which consisted of removing the pups of the nest and weighing them (about 5 min/litter), (2) full handling performed 2 h after nursing with a treatment similar to the previous, (3) routine check, within 0.5 h after nursing, which consisted of touching the pups by the stockperson to see whether all pups were alive (about 5 s/litter), (4) routine check, 2 h after nursing. At 28 days of age, the timidity of the pups was measured in a 5 min approach test. Pups that were handled within 0.5 h after nursing, irrespectively of the duration of handling, appeared to be tamer as they approached the experimenter's hand with a lower latency and more times then those handled later. We conclude that, in an apparent sensitive period, even minimal human contact is effective in reducing avoidance of the caretaker. Thus, handling might be a useful tool to reduce stress and improve welfare even under intensive farming conditions. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

At present, these conditions are quantified by self-report questionnaires that only apply to behaviors that are accessible to consciousness, or by the timing of responses to fear- and anxiety-related words that are indirect since they do not produce fear, e.g., Dot Probe Test and emotional Stroop. We now review the conditioned responses (CRs) to fear produced by a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus CS+) when it cues a painful laser unconditioned stimulus (US). These CRs include autonomic (Skin Conductance Response) and ratings of the CS+ unpleasantness, ability to command attention, and the recognition of the association of CS+ with US (expectancy). These CRs are directly related to fear, and some measure behaviors that are minimally accessible to consciousness e.g., economic scales. Fear-related CRs include non-phase-locked phase changes in oscillatory EEG power defined by frequency and time post-stimulus over baseline, and changes in phase-locked visual and laser evoked responses both of which include late potentials reflecting attention or expectancy, like the P300, or contingent negative variation. Increases (ERS) and decreases (ERD) in oscillatory power post-stimulus may be generalizable given their consistency across healthy subjects. ERS and ERD are related to the ratings above as well as to anxious personalities and clinical anxiety and can resolve activity over short time intervals like those for some moods and emotions. These results could be incorporated into an objective instrumented test that measures EEG and CRs of autonomic activity and psychological ratings related to conditioned fear, some of which are subliminal. As in the case of instrumented tests of vigilance, these results could be useful for the direct, objective measurement of multiple aspects of the risk, diagnosis, and monitoring of therapies for anxiety disorders and anxious personalities.","[Chien, Jui-Hong; Meeker, Timothy J.; Saffer, Mark I.; Lenz, Fred A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Colloca, Luana] Univ Maryland, Sch Nursing, Dept Pain Translat Symptom Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Colloca, Luana] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Korzeniewska, Anna] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Bienvenu, O.

Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) advocate using neurobiological intermediate phenotypes that provide dimensional correlates of psychopathology. Negative Valence Systems in the RDoC matrix include the construct of acute threat, which can be measured on a physiological level using potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex assessed via electromyography recordings of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Impairments in extinction of fear-potentiated startle due to high levels of fear (termed fear load) during the early phases of extinction have been observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goals of the current work were to examine dimensional associations between fear-related symptoms of PTSD and fear load variables to test their validity as an intermediate phenotype. We examined extinction of fear-potentiated startle in a cohort (n = 269) of individuals with a broad range of civilian trauma exposure (range 0-13 traumatic events per person, mean = 3.5). Based on previously reported findings, we hypothesized that fear load would be significantly associated with intrusion and fear memories of an index traumatic event. The results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts (p = 0.0007) and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders (p = 0.036). Degree of adult or childhood trauma exposure, and depression severity were not associated with fear load. After controlling for age, sex, race, income, level of prior trauma, and level of fear conditioning, fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts (p = 0.004). The significance of these findings is that they support dimensional associations with symptom severity rather than diagnostic category and, as such, fear load may emerge as a transdiagnostic intermediate phenotype expressed across fear-related disorders (e.g., specific phobia, social phobia).

In recent years, active and passive trophic rewilding have potentially begun restoring these lost top-down controls. The Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii has declined severely due to a novel transmissible cancer. In response to extinction fears, devils were introduced to the devil-free Maria Island, where their abundance rapidly increased. We tested how this introduction influenced risk-sensitive foraging in the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula, a major prey species for devils, using giving-up densities (GUDs). Before the introduction of devils, possum GUDs on Maria Island were indistinguishable from the long-diseased region of Tasmania, where devils have been rare since similar to 2000. Three years after devil introduction, GUDs were 64% higher on Maria Island than the control region, demonstrating that after an initial period of high mortality, possums quickly adopted risk-sensitive foraging behaviours. Devil activity across Maria Island was variable, leading to a heterogeneous landscape of fear and highlighting that top predators must be at functional densities to elicit behavioural responses from prey. Our study provides strong evidence that top predators modify the behaviour of prey by instilling fear, causing rapid ecological change following recoveries.","[Cunningham, Calum X.; Johnson, Christopher N.; Hollings, Tracey; Kreger, Kaely; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Johnson, Christopher N.] Univ Tasmania, Australian Res Council Ctr Australian Biodivers &, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Hollings, Tracey] Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia",,"Cunningham, CX (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",calum.cunningham@utas.edu.au,"CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019; Cunningham, Calum X/O-9638-2015; Johnson, Chris/J-7894-2014","Cunningham, Calum X/0000-0003-1640-2533; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Kreger, Kaely/0000-0002-5010-5797; Johnson, Chris/0000-0002-9719-3771",,,,43,11,11,8,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,DEC,2019,42,12,,,SI,,2053,2059,,10.1111/ecog.04635,,,7,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JU0HZ,WOS:000501362200006,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2022-03-23,

The current set of experiments sought to determine whether reproductive experience also alters the molecular features of fear extinction. In adult male rats, it has been widely demonstrated that the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) is essential for fear extinction. We therefore compared the involvement of NMDAR in fear extinction between nulliparous (virgin) and primiparous (reproductively experienced) female rats. Nulliparous and primiparous females received systemic administrations of either MK-801 (a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist) or saline prior to extinction training. MK-801 was found to impair extinction recall in nulliparous females, but not primiparous females. When the same dose of MK-801 was administered prior to conditioning, both groups of rats showed impaired recall of conditioning the following day. The results of these experiments indicate that the extinction, but not the acquisition of fear, may become NMDAR-independent following reproductive experience.","[Tang, Samantha; Graham, Bronwyn M.] UNSW, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",,"Tang, S (corresponding author), UNSW, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",samantha.tang@unsw.edu.au,,"Graham, Bronwyn/0000-0001-6582-2273; Tang, Samantha/0000-0001-5178-3816","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DE140100243, DP180101563]; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government",This work was supported by grants from the Australian Research Council (DE140100243 and DP180101563) to BMG and an Australian Postgraduate Award to ST.,,73,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JAN,2019,236,1,,,,,251,264,,10.1007/s00213-018-4956-y,,,14,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,HL4IV,WOS:000458681900018,29959460,,,,2022-03-23,

While hunger suppresses the fear circuitry to promote explorative food-seeking behavior, satiety or obesity may increase fear to prevent unnecessary risk-taking. Here we aimed to unravel which metabolic factors, that transfer information about the acute and the chronic metabolic status, are of primary importance to regulate fear, and to identify their sites of action within fear-related brain regions. We performed a de novo analysis of central and peripheral metabolic factors that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier using genome-wide expression data across the mouse brain from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA). The central fear circuitry, as defined by subnuclei of the amygdala, the afferent hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex and the efferent periaqueductal gray, was enriched with metabolic receptors. Some of their corresponding ligands were known to modulate fear (e.g., estrogen and thyroid hormones) while others had not been associated with fear before (e.g., glucagon, ACTH). Additionally, several of these enriched metabolic receptors were coexpressed with well-described fear-modulating genes (Crh, Crhr1, or Crht2). Co-expression analysis of monoamine markers and metabolic receptors suggested that monoaminergic nuclei have differential sensitivity to metabolic alterations. Serotonergic neurons expressed a large number of metabolic receptors (e.g., estrogen receptors, fatty acid receptors), suggesting a wide responsivity to metabolic changes. The noradrenergic system seemed to be specifically sensitive to hypocretin/orexin modulation. Taken together, we identified a number of novel metabolic factors (glucagon, ACTH) that have the potential to modulate the fear response. We additionally propose novel cerebral targets for metabolic factors (e.g., thyroid hormones) that modulate fear, but of which the sites of action are (largely) unknown.","[Koorneef, Lisa L.; Bogaards, Marit; Meijer, Onno C.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Endocrinol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Koorneef, Lisa L.; Bogaards, Marit; Meijer, Onno C.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Einthoven Lab Expt Vasc Med, Leiden, Netherlands; [Reinders, Marcel J.

We report that genes related to the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as genes that modulate serotonergic, dopaminergic, and neuropeptidergic functions or plasticity, play a role in this context. The strong overlap of the genetic targets involved in stress and fear learning suggests that a dimensional and mechanistic model of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder based on these constructs is promising. Genome-wide genetic analyses on fear and stress mechanisms are scarce. So far, reliable replication is still lacking for most of the molecular genetic findings, and the proportion of explained variance is rather small. Further analysis of neurogenetic stress and fear learning needs to integrate data from animal and human studies.","[Nees, Frauke; Flor, Herta] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Cognit & Clin Neurosci, Mannheim, Germany; [Witt, Stephanie H.] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Genet Epidemiol Psychiat, Mannheim, Germany; [Flor, Herta] Univ Mannheim, Sch Social Sci, Dept Psychol, Mannheim, Germany",,"Flor, H (corresponding author), Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Cognit & Clin Neurosci, J5, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",herta.flor@zi-mannheim.de,"Nees, Frauke/AAZ-2150-2020","Flor, Herta/0000-0003-4809-5398; Nees, Frauke/0000-0002-7796-8234","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB636/C1, SFB636/C7]",HF and FN received grant support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Grant No. SFB636/C1 to HF and Grant No. SFB636/C7 to FN and Kristina Szabo).,,150,15,15,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Previous studies have shown that PPI in rats can be enhanced by auditory fear conditioning. In this study, we evaluated the effects of contextual fear conditioning (FC) for six times a day and fear extinction (FE) for seven days on PPI in mice. C57BL/6J mice (male, 8-12 weeks) were divided into three groups; no-FC (control), FC and FC + FE. We measured PPI at the following three time points, (I) baseline before FC, (2) after FC, and (3) after FE. The results showed that PPI was increased after FC. Moreover, the enhanced PPI following FC was observed even after FE with decreased freezing behaviors. These results suggested contextual fear conditioning could enhance acoustic PPI, and that contextual fear extinction could decrease freezing behaviors, but not acoustic PPI. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have demonstrated a role for serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptors in fear conditioning. However, the relative contribution of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors and post-synaptic 5-HT1A heteroreceptors in fear conditioning is still unclear.ObjectiveTo determine the role of pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the acquisition and expression of cued and contextual conditioned fear.MethodsWe studied the acute effects of four 5-HT1A receptor ligands in the fear-potentiated startle test. Male Wistar rats were injected with the 5-HT1A receptors biased agonists F13714 (0-0.16mg/kg, IP), which preferentially activates somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, or F15599 (0-0.16mg/kg, IP), which preferentially activates cortical post-synaptic 5-HT1A heteroreceptors, with the prototypical 5-HT1A receptor agonist R(+)8-OH-DPAT (0-0.3mg/kg, SC) or the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100,635 (0-1.0mg/kg, SC).ResultsF13714 (0.16mg/kg) and R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.03mg/kg) injected before training reduced cued fear acquisition. Pre-treatment with F15599 or WAY100,635 had no effect on fear learning. In the fear-potentiated startle test, F13714 (0.04-0.16mg/kg) and R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.1-0.3mg/kg) reduced the expression of cued and contextual fear, whereas F15599 had no effect. WAY100,635 (0.03-1.0mg/kg) reduced the overall startle response.ConclusionsThe current findings indicate that activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors reduces cued fear learning, whereas 5-HT1A receptors seem not involved in contextual fear learning. Moreover, activation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors may reduce cued and contextual fear expression, whereas we found no evidence for the involvement of cortical 5-HT1A heteroreceptors in the expression of conditioned fear.","[Zhao, Yulong; Bijlsma, Elisabeth Y.; ter Heegde, Freija; Verdouw, Monika P.; Garssen, J.; Groenink, Lucianne] Univ Utrecht, Fac Sci, UIPS, Div Pharmacol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Newman-Tancredi, Adrian] Neurolixis Inc, Dana Point, CA USA; [Groenink, Lucianne] UMC Utrecht, BCRM, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Groenink, L (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Sci, UIPS, Div Pharmacol, Utrecht, Netherlands.; Groenink, L (corresponding author), UMC Utrecht, BCRM, Utrecht, Netherlands.",l.groenink@uu.nl,"Newman-Tancredi, Adrian/ABI-6383-2020","Zhao, Yulong/0000-0002-5960-6395",China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201306300062],"This work was supported by the funding for PhD students from China Scholarship Council (201306300062, 2013-2017).",,83,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,APR,2019,236,4,,,,,1171,1185,,10.1007/s00213-018-5124-0,,,15,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,IF3LG,WOS:000472981400005,30539269,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022-03-23,

These different phases of classical fear conditioning involve coordinated interactions between the extended amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortices. Here, I first define the different stages of learning involved in cued and context fear conditioning and describe the neural circuits underlying these processes. The serotonergic system can be manipulated by administering serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists, as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and these can have significant effects on emotional learning and memory. Moreover, variations in serotonergic genes can influence fear conditioning and extinction processes, and can underlie differential responses to pharmacological manipulations. This research has considerable translational significance as imbalances in the serotonergic system have been linked to anxiety and depression, while abnormalities in the mechanisms of conditioned fear contribute to anxiety disorders.

Interestingly, clinical evidence suggests that novelty seeking is a good predictor for vulnerability to the development of excessive and persistent fear. Here, we first tested this hypothesis by analyzing contextual and cued fear responses of rats selected for their high (high responders, HR) or low (low responders, LR) exploration of a novel environment, indicator of novelty seeking. While HR and LR rats exhibited similar sensitivity to the shock and cued fear memory retention, fewer extinction sessions were required in HR than LR animals to reach extinction, indicating faster contextual and cued memory extinction. In a second part, we found an effective disruption of contextual fear reconsolidation by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, associated with a down-regulation of early growth response 1 (Egr1) in the hippocampal CA1 area, and up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA levels in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices. Altogether, these data demonstrate a link between novelty seeking and conditioned fear extinction, and highlight a promising novel role of ketamine in affecting established fear memory.

In these experiments, rats are trained to fear an initially neutral stimulus by pairing that stimulus with shock. The amount of fear elicited by the stimulus [i.e., now a conditioned stimulus (CS)] is later assessed by presenting startle-eliciting noise bursts both in the presence and also the absence of the CS. After training, startle responses are typically greater in the presence of the CS. Findings reviewed here suggest that amygdala N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a key role in triggering the neural changes that support fear learning and also the loss of fear that accompanies extinction training. Amygdala(+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors also participate in fear learning. However, unlike NNMA receptor antagonists, AMPA receptor antagonists also block fear-potentiated startle when infused prior to testing. Very recent data indicate that glutamate metabotropic Group II receptor agonists also block fear learning when infused into the amygdala prior to training, and block fear-potentiated startle when infused prior to testing. A fuller understanding of the role of amygdala glutamate systems in fear and fear learning may suggest novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of clinical anxiety disorders.

The aims of the present study were to compare primiparous and multiparous women's experiences of fear of delivery during an early stage of active labor (cervix dilatation 3-5 centimeters) and to study whether fear of delivery, measured during the early stage of active labor, was a predictor of the amount of pain relief received during the remaining part of labor (cervix dilatation 5 cm - partus), of the duration of the remaining part of labor, and of the occurrence of instrumental vaginal delivery and emergency cesarean section. Method. Thirty-five primiparous and 39 multiparous women answered the Delivery Fear Scale (DFS) once during the early stage of labor and before they had received any pain relief. Results. Primiparous women reported higher levels of fear than multiparous women did. Fear during the first phase of labor predicted only the total amount of pain relief received during labor. Conclusion. The clinical implications of the study are that the delivery staff should consider women's fear during labor and pay attention especially to primiparous women's increased risk of higher levels of fear during an early stage of active labor, as compared with multiparous women's. The challenge for staff of a delivery ward is to support the woman in labor in a way that decreases fear, which in turn might reduce the woman's need of gain relief.","Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth & Environm, Div Obstet & Gynaecol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden; Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Div Obstet & Gynaecol, Linkoping, Sweden; Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Div Womens Hlth, Linkoping, Sweden",,"Alehagen, S (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth & Environm, Div Obstet & Gynaecol, S-58185 Linkoping, Sweden.",,,,,,,29,58,58,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0001-6349,1600-0412,,ACTA OBSTET GYN SCAN,Acta Obstet.

Therefore, determining how caregivers regulate children's affective neurobiology is essential for understanding psychopathology etiology and prevention. Much of the research on affective functioning uses fear learning to map maturation trajectories, with both rodent and human studies contributing knowledge. Nonetheless, as no standard framework exists through which to interpret developmental effects across species, research often remains siloed, thus contributing to the current therapeutic impasse. Here, we propose a developmental ecology framework that attempts to understand fear in the ecological context of the child: their relationship with their parent. By referring to developmental goals that are shared across species (to attach to, then, ultimately, separate from the parent), this framework provides a common grounding from which fear systems and their dysfunction can be understood, thus advancing research on psychopathologies and their treatment.","[Callaghan, Bridget; Van Tieghem, Michelle; Harmon, Chelsea; Tottenham, Nim] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Callaghan, Bridget] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Meyer, Heidi; Li, Anfei; Lee, Francis S.] Weill Cornell Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Opendak, Maya; Sullivan, Regina M.] NYU, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Opendak, Maya; Sullivan, Regina M.] Nathan S Klein Inst Psychiat Res, Orangeburg, NY 10962 USA",,"Callaghan, B (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Callaghan, B (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",blc2139@columbia.edu; hem2022@med.cornell.edu; maya.opendak@nyumc.org; mrv2115@columbia.edu; cmh2228@columbia.edu; anl2038@med.cornell.edu; fslee@med.cornell.edu; regina.sullivan@nyumc.org; nlt7@columbia.edu,,"Sullivan, Regina/0000-0002-2406-8857; Opendak, Maya/0000-0003-4334-3188","EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R37HD083217] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F31MH115686, R01MH091864, F32MH112232, K99MH113821] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCATS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [TL1 TR002386, UL1 TR002384] Funding Source: Medline; NICHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R37 HD083217] Funding Source: Medline; NIDCD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01 DC009910] Funding Source: Medline; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32 GM007739] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32 MH112232, F31 MH115686, R01 MH091864, K99 MH113821, R01 MH091451] Funding Source: Medline",,,144,38,38,0,4,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1548-5943,,,ANNU REV CLIN PSYCHO,Annu.

Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia, fear avoidance beliefs, or pain anxiety, pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied multiple kernel learning approach allowed the generation of models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of nonoverlapping neural predictors within fear-processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.","[Meier, Michael Lukas; Vrana, Andrea; Humphreys, Barry Kim; Schweinhardt, Petra] Balgrist Univ Hosp, Dept Chiropract Med, Integrat Spinal Res, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Seifritz, Erich; Stampfli, Philipp] Univ Zurich, Hosp Psychiat, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stampfli, Philipp] Univ Zurich, Psychiat Hosp, MR Ctr, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schweinhardt, Petra] McGill Univ, Alan Edwards Ctr Res Pain, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Meier, ML (corresponding author), Balgrist Campus,Lengghalde 5, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",Michael.meier@balgrist.ch,"Schweinhardt, Petra/AAC-6797-2021","Stampfli, Philipp/0000-0003-1684-2416; Meier, Michael/0000-0001-6004-8338; Schweinhardt, Petra/0000-0003-4837-6595","Foundation for the Education of Chiropractors; Balgrist Foundation, Switzerland","This work was supported by the Foundation for the Education of Chiropractors and the Balgrist Foundation, Switzerland.",,92,5,5,0,4,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,2373-2822,,ENEURO,eNeuro,NOV-DEC,2018,5,6,,,,,,,UNSP e0107-18.2018,10.1523/ENEURO.0107-18.2018,,,15,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,HJ1CF,WOS:000456898800004,30627654,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-03-23,

For each technique, we review what is known about the underlying neural systems, combining findings from animal models and human neuroscience. The current evidence suggests that these different means of regulating fear depend on both overlapping and distinct components of a fear circuitry.

Emerging strategies to enhance exposure therapy in humans and fear extinction retention in animal models are primarily pharmacological. These approaches are limited as many patients report preferring non-pharmacological approaches in therapy. With general cognitive enhancement effects, exercise has emerged as a plausible non-pharmacological augmentation strategy. The present study tested the hypothesis that fear extinction and exposure therapy would be enhanced by a pre-training bout of exercise. Methods: We conducted four experiments with rats that involved a standardized conditioning and extinction paradigm and a manipulation of exercise. In a fifth experiment, we manipulated vigorous-intensity exercise prior to a standardized virtual reality exposure therapy session among adults with fear of heights. Results: In experiments 1-4, exercise did not facilitate fear extinction, long-term memory, or fear relapse tests. In experiment 5, human participants showed an overall reduction in fear of heights but exercise did not enhance symptom improvement. Conclusions: Although acute exercise prior to fear extinction or exposure therapy, as operationalized in the present 5 studies, did not enhance outcomes, these results must be interpreted within the context of a broader literature that includes positive findings. Taken all together, this suggests that more research is necessary to identify optimal parameters and key individual differences so that exercise can be implemented successfully to treat anxiety disorders.","[Jacquart, Jolene; Roquet, Rheall F.; Papini, Santiago; Powers, Mark B.; Smits, Jasper A.

Three experiments investigated the speed, magnitude, and robustness of UK children's (6-10 years; N = 290; 122 boys, 168 girls) vicariously learned fear responses for three types of stimuli. In two experiments, children were presented with pictures of novel animals (Australian marsupials) and flowers (fear-irrelevant stimuli) alone (control) or together with faces expressing fear or happiness. To determine learning speed the number of stimulus-face pairings seen by children was varied (1, 10, or 30 trials). Robustness of learning was examined via repeated extinction procedures over 3 weeks. A third experiment compared the magnitude and robustness of vicarious fear learning for snakes and marsupials. Significant increases in fear responses were found for snakes, marsupials and flowers. There was no indication that vicarious learning for marsupials was faster than for flowers. Moreover, vicariously learned fear was neither greater nor more robust for snakes compared to marsupials, or for marsupials compared to flowers. These findings suggest that for this age group stimulus fear relevance may have little influence on vicarious fear learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the outcome of such environmental changes will depend on the resources provided. We provided either various physical items that posed no biosecurity risk and were inexpensive (such as balls, chains, a perch and rope) to alter behavioral time budgets and interactions with the environment or provided additional visual contact with humans (10 min daily) with the aim to reduce fearfulness. Additional human contact reduced fear of humans at 35 days of age, but did not affect general fearfulness. Increased environmental complexity via the provision of physical items reduced some indicators of fear at 21 days, but not at 35 days of age. A woodblock and perch were the most favored physical items, but chickens preferred to sit underneath the perch rather than on top. When pecking items were not provided, chickens redirected their pecking to the wood shaving litter. Overall, there was little evidence that our physical items improved the chickens' behavioral time budget, fear, physiological stress or production. The benefits of additional visual contact with humans should be investigated on larger groups to ensure that such effects are practical and effective to reduce fear of humans on farm. Increased environmental complexity can improve animal welfare, depending on the resources provided and use by the animal. We provided chickens either with physical items that posed no biosecurity risk and were inexpensive (balls, chains, perches and rope) (P; n = 36) or additional visual human contact (10 min daily) (HC; n = 36) compared to farm-like standard control groups (C; n = 36) with 3 pens per treatment. Additional human contact reduced fear of humans at 35 days of age, but not general fearfulness. P birds required more inductions to induce tonic immobility compared to HC and C birds at 21 days of age. However, other indicators of fear (open field test and plasma corticosterone concentration) did not significantly differ.

Brain size relative to body size as well as brainstem region size relative to whole brain size were significantly smaller in chicks selected for low fear of humans compared to chicks selected for high fear of humans. However, when including allometric effects in the model, these differences disappear but a tendency towards larger cerebra in low-fear chickens remains.

While both benzodiazepines and stimulant drugs may influence the formation of episodic memories for emotional events, their effects on fear conditioning are less clear. This study compared the effects of diazepam with methylphenidate on fear conditioning. In a single-session between groups design with three conditions [placebo, diazepam (10 mg), and methylphenidate (40 mg)], classical conditioning of a skin conductance response to a visual stimulus previously paired with a 100-db white noise was tested in 45 healthy volunteers. Diazepam blocked fear conditioning, despite responses to the unconditioned aversive stimulus and neutral control stimulus being unimpaired. Conditioning remained intact after methylphenidate. Conditioned responses were not extinguished completely by the end of the experiment, and it was not possible to draw conclusions about the effects of the drugs on extinction. Although diazepam has well-documented amnesic effects, it has not been found to affect implicit forms of memory like perceptual and conceptual priming. As the present study found impaired fear conditioning after diazepam, it adds weight to recent findings that emotional memories are disproportionately impaired by the benzodiazepines.","Univ Southampton, Sch Psychol, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; UCL, Subdept Clin Hlth Psychol, Clin Psychopharmacol Unit, London WC1H 6BT, England",,"Brignell, CM (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Psychol, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",c.brignell@soton.ac.uk,,"Brignell, Catherine //0000-0001-7768-6272",,,,69,14,14,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0033-3158,1432-2072,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Psychopharmacology,JUL,2006,186,4,,,,,504,516,,10.1007/s00213-006-0363-x,,,13,Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,051DD,WOS:000238140000002,16758238,,,,2022-03-23,

However, there is no experimental evidence demonstrating that fear learning and generalization to visceral sensations can be established in humans and alter visceral perception. Methods In a novel fear learning-generalization paradigm, an innocuous esophageal balloon distension served as conditioned stimulus (CS), and distensions at three different pressure levels around the pain detection threshold were used as generalization stimuli. During fear learning, the CS was paired with a painful electrical stimulus (unconditioned stimulus) in the conditioning group (n = 30), whereas in the control group (n = 30), the unconditioned stimulus was delivered alone. Before and after fear learning, visceral perception thresholds for first sensation, discomfort, and pain and visceral discrimination sensitivity were assessed. Results Fear learning was established in the conditioning group only (potentiated eye-blink startle to the CS (t(464.06) = 3.17, p = .002), and fear generalization to other stimulus intensities was observed (t(469.12) = 2.97, p = .003; t(464.29) = 4.17, p < .001). The thresholds for first sensation habituated in the control group, whereas it remained constant in the conditioning group (F(1,43) = 9.77, p = .003). Conclusions These data show that fear learning using visceral stimuli induces fear generalization and influences visceral perception. These findings support the idea that in functional gastrointestinal disorder, fear learning and generalization can foster gastrointestinal-specific anxiety and contribute to visceral hypersensitivity.","[Zaman, Jonas; Weltens, Nathalie; Van den Bergh, Omer; Van Diest, Ilse] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Res Grp Hlth Psychol, Leuven, Belgium; [Weltens, Nathalie; Ly, Huynh Giao; Van Oudenhove, Lukas] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Res Ctr Gastrointestinal Disorders TARGID, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Leuven, Belgium; [Struyf, Dieter] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ctr Psychol Learning & Expt Psychopathol, Leuven, Belgium; [Vlaeyen, Johan W.

Fighting fear can thus be a crucial part of counterterrorist policies. In the case of terrorism, citizens look to the state for protection. Yet, most studies of terrorist fear emphasize individual-level factors. We lack studies that link fear to features of the state, especially whether democratic states are capable of reducing fear among its citizens. Our study aims to fill part of this research gap by asking whether democratic government reduces or increases fear of terrorism. We find that there is substantial cross-country variance in citizens' fear of terrorism. The results suggest that fear is more widespread among citizens in non-democratic countries compared to citizens in democratic countries. Actual exposure to terrorist attacks has no impact on citizens' fear of terrorism when we account for whether the country is a democracy or not. Hence, democratic government displays resilience towards fear mongering.","[Christensen, Dag Arne] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 112, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; [Christensen, Dag Arne; Aars, Jacob] Univ Bergen, Dept Adm & Org Theory, Bergen, Norway",,"Christensen, DA (corresponding author), Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 112, N-5008 Bergen, Norway.",dag.christensen@uni.no,,,Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,This research was funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

Wagner (1972, A theory of Pavlovian conditioning: Variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and nonreinforcement, in A. H. B. W. F. Prokasy (Ed.), Classical conditioning: II. Current research and theory, pp. 64-99, New York, NY, Appleton-Century-Crofts) postulated that the number of exposure trials is the primary determinant of CR decrement, whereas C. R. Gallistel and J. Gibbon (2000, Time, rate, and conditioning, Psychological Review, Vol. 107, pp. 289-344) proposed that the decisive event is the cumulated exposure time to the nonreinforced conditioned stimulus (CS) elapsed after the last CS reinforcement. We evaluated these two accounts in a human differential fear conditioning study in which CR was measured with the fear-potentiated startle response. Cumulated duration of nonreinforcement falls to explain our findings, whereas the number of trials appeared critical. In fact, many CS trials with a duration shorter than the acquisition CS duration facilitated within-session extinction, but this effect did not predict the recovery of fear.","[Golkar, Armita; Bellander, Martin; Ohman, Arne] Karolinska Inst, Psychol Sect, Dept Clin Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Golkar, A (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Psychol Sect, Dept Clin Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",armita.golkar@ki.se,"Bellander, Martin/C-9819-2013","Golkar, Armita/0000-0003-3077-0391",,,,37,26,26,0,24,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0735-7044,1939-0084,,BEHAV NEUROSCI,Behav.

It has been shown that this enhancement is evident by moderate fear levels, but is less affected by high fear levels. Potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex has also been reported in the presence of background cues previously associated with footshocks. However, the effects of anxiolytic drugs on different levels of fear elicited by moderate and intense contextual fear conditioning associated with startle reflex have not been examined yet. To approach this issue, we examined the effects of the anxiolytic, midazolam, on two intensities of contextual fear; freezing behavior and the startle response to loud noise. First, we compared the magnitude of the freezing behavior and the startle amplitude during the testing sessions in groups of rats submitted to fear conditioning using 0.3 and 0.6 mA as unconditioned stimuli (10 stimuli of 1 s each, intertrial interval from 60 to 180 s). Afterwards, the effects of midazolam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) were assessed in these two conditions. Rats showed a potentiated startle reflex and a significant freezing behavior to moderate fear conditioning, which were both attenuated by midazolam. Higher levels of fear conditioning caused more intense freezing behavior without enhancing the startle reflex. Whereas midazolam reduced this freezing response, the startle response was unaffected. These results are indicative that anxiolytic-sensitive freezing and fear-potentiated startle are triggered by moderate contextual fear conditioning, while contextual conditioning with the use of high footshocks causes a distinct pattern of behavioral responses, which is only partially affected by midazolam. Due to the differential sensitivity to midazolam of these two patterns of startle responses generated as a function of the intensity of contextual fear conditioning, it is proposed that they represent moderate and intense aversive states that may be related to anxiety or panic/phobic conditions, respectively.

Experimental methods to advance this topic are lacking, and therefore we propose a novel tactile conditioning paradigm. Seventy-six pain-free participants underwent acquisition in a predictable as well as an unpredictable pain context. In the predictable context, vibrotactile stimulation was paired with painful electrocutaneous stimulation (simulating allodynia). In the unpredictable context, vibrotactile stimulation was unpaired with pain (simulating spontaneous pain). During an extinction phase, a cue exposure and context exposure group continued in the predictable and unpredictable context, respectively, without pain. A control group received continued acquisition in both contexts. Self-reported fear and skin conductance response's, but not startle responses, showed fear of touch was acquired in the predictable context. Context-related startle responses showed contextual fear emerged in the unpredictable context, together with elevated self-reported fear and skin conductance responses evoked by the unpaired vibrotactile stimulations. Cue exposure reduced fear of touch, whereas context exposure reduced contextual fear. Thus, painful touch leads to increased fear, as does touch in the same context as unpredictable pain, and extinction protocols can reduce this fear. We conclude that tactile conditioning is valuable for investigating fear of touch and can advance our understanding of chronic pain. Perspectives: The acquisition and extinction of fear of touch was investigated in a clinical analog study using a novel tactile fear conditioning paradigm. The results have implications for research on the development and treatment of chronic pain conditions characterized by allodynia and spontaneous pain fluctuations.

Indirect evidence in rodents suggests that acute cortisone could selectively increase some forms of long-duration aversive states, such as anxiety, but not relatively similar, briefer aversive states, such as fear. However, no prior experimental studies in humans consider the unique effects of cortisol on anxiety and fear, using well-validated methods for eliciting these two similar but dissociable aversive states. The current study examines these effects, as instantiated with short- and long-duration threats. Methods: Healthy volunteers (n = 18) received placebo or a low (20 mg) or a high (60 mg) dose of hydrocortisone in a double-blind crossover design. Subjects were exposed repeatedly to three 150-sec duration conditions: no shock; predictable shocks, in which shocks were signaled by a short-duration threat cue; and unpredictable shocks. Aversive states were indexed by acoustic startle. Fear was operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during the threat cue in the predictable condition (fear-potentiated startle). Anxiety was operationally defined as the increase in baseline startle from the no shock to the two threat conditions (anxiety-potentiated startle). Results: Hydrocortisone affected neither baseline nor short-duration, fear-potentiated startle but increased long-duration anxiety-potentiated startle. Conclusions: These results suggest that hydrocortisone administration in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear. Possible mechanisms implicated are discussed in light of prior data in rodents. Specifically, hydrocortisone might increase anxiety via sensitization of corticotrophin-releasing hormones in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.","[Grillon, Christian; Heller, Randi; Hirschhorn, Elizabeth; Pine, Daniel S.] NIMH, Mood & Anxiety Disorders Program, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kling, Mitchel A.] Philadelphia Vet Adm Med Ctr, Behav Hlth Serv, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Schulkin, Jay] Georgetown Univ Sch Med, Dept Neurosci, Washington, DC USA; [Vythilingam, Meena] Off Assistant Secretary Def, Falls Church, VA USA",,"Grillon, C (corresponding author), NIMH MAP, 15K North Dr,Bldg 15K,Room 203,MSC 2670, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",Christian.grillon@nih.gov,"Pine, Daniel/Z-1601-2019; Kling, Mitchel A/F-4152-2010","Kling, Mitchel A/0000-0002-2232-1409",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [ZIAMH002798] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health.,,52,23,23,1,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Their main findings were a role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in threat anticipation, and for the amygdala in threat confrontation. Here, we provide a critical summary of this interesting study and point out some important issues that were not addressed by its authors.

Although classical theory predicts optimal foraging under risk, empirical studies report large unexplained variation in behaviour. Intrinsic individual differences in risk-taking behaviour might contribute to this variation. By repeatedly exposing individuals of a small mesopredator to different experimental landscapes of risks and resources, we tested 1) whether individuals adjust their foraging behaviour according to predictions of the general tradeoff between energy gain and predation avoidance and 2) whether individuals differ consistently and predictably from each other in how they solve this tradeoff. Wild-caught individuals (n = 42) of the jumping spiderMarpissa muscosa, were subjected to repeated release and open-field tests to quantify among-individual variation in boldness and activity. Subsequently, individuals were tested in four foraging tests that differed in risk level (white/dark background colour) and risk variation (constant risk/variable risk simulated by bird dummy overflights) and contained inaccessible but visually perceivable food patches. When exposed to a white background, individuals reduced some aspects of movement and foraging intensity, suggesting that the degree of camouflage serves as a proxy of perceived risk in these predators. Short pulses of acute predation risk, simulated by bird overflights, had only small effects on aspects of foraging behaviour. Notably, a significant part of variation in foraging was due to among-individual differences across risk landscapes that are linked to consistent individual variation in activity, forming a behavioural syndrome. Our results demonstrate the importance of among-individual differences in behaviour of animals that forage under different levels of perceived risk. Since these differences likely affect food-web dynamics and have fitness consequences, future studies should explore the mechanisms that maintain the observed variation in natural populations.","[Steinhoff, Philip O.

Conditioned fear in animals has been considered a good model for human anxiety disorders, but animal models of anxiety have several limitations. Conditioned fear in animals can be directed to a specific stressor and is easily extinguished. Furthermore, animals do not seem to be able to develop the capacity to worry excessively about the future. While animal models are useful and can demonstrate psychiatric illnesses, they do not completely mimic the complex cognitive processes that occur in anxious humans. Thus, we hypothesize that human anxiety disorders are caused at least in part by differential activity in the prefrontal cortex, the brain region that most separates us from our nearest genetic neighbors. The human prefrontal cortex has not only been shown to be more developed than that of other mammals, but it also has unique morphology and gene expression. Neuroimaging studies repeatedly show abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex in anxious individuals. Thus, we suggest that the very same cortical complexity that allows us to produce a vibrant culture is also the seat of anxiety disorders. Interestingly, preclinical studies have shown that the prefrontal cortex inhibits the amygdala. There appears to be a distinction between two classes of anxiety disorders. Those disorders involving intense fear and panic - panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias - seem to be characterized by an underactivity of the prefrontal cortex, thus disinhibiting the amygdala. Disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which involve worry and rumination, on the other hand, seem to be characterized by an overactivity of the prefrontal cortex. Studies of prefrontal cortical function in psychiatric illness should be a fruitful method for identifying effective treatment approaches.","Comprehens Neurosci Inc, White Plains, NY 10605 USA; Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA; SUNY Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; Kings County Hosp Ctr, White Plains, NY USA",,"Gorman, JM (corresponding author), Comprehens Neurosci Inc, 21 Bloomingdale Rd, White Plains, NY 10605 USA.",jack.gorman@alumni.upenn.edu,,,,,,87,72,77,4,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0334-1763,1607-8470,,REV NEUROSCIENCE,Rev.

We used positron emission tomography with O-15-water to study neural networks associated with startle modulation by phobic fear in a group of subjects with specific snake or spider phobia, but not both, during exposure to pictures of their feared and non-feared objects, paired and unpaired with acoustic startle stimuli. Measurement of eye electromyographic activity confirmed startle potentiation during the phobic as compared with the non-phobic condition. Employing a factorial design, we evaluated brain correlates of startle modulation as the interaction between startle and affect, using the double subtraction contrast (phobic startle vs. phobic alone) vs. (non-phobic startle vs. non-phobic alone). As a result of startle potentiation, a significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow was found in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region, and medially in the affective division of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These results provide evidence from functional brain imaging for a modulatory role of the amygdaloid complex on startle reactions in humans. They also point to the involvement of the affective ACC in the processing of startle stimuli during emotionally aversive experiences. The co-activation of these areas may reflect increased attention to fear-relevant stimuli. Thus, we suggest that the amygdaloid area and the ACC form part of a neural system dedicated to attention and orientation to danger, and that this network modulates startle during negative affect.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychiat, Uppsala, Sweden; Uppsala Imanet, Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Tromso, Dept Psychol, N-9001 Tromso, Norway",,"Pissiota, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Uppsala, Sweden.",anna.pissiota@psyk.uu.se,"Flaten, Magne Arve/A-2029-2014",,,,,62,110,114,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0953-816X,1460-9568,,EUR J NEUROSCI,Eur.

This nuanced story has been obscured by a great deal of research into the therapeutic applications of exogenous OT, driving more than 400 ongoing clinical trials. Drawing from animal models and human studies, we review the complex evidence concerning OT's role in fear learning and anxiety, clarifying the existing confusion about modulation of fear versus anxiety. We discuss animal models and human studies demonstrating the prevailing role of OT in strengthening fear memory to a discrete signal or cue, which allows accurate and rapid threat detection that facilitates survival. We also review ostensibly contrasting behavioral studies that nonetheless provide compelling evidence of OT attenuating sustained contextual fear and anxiety-like behavior, arguing that these OT effects on the modulation of fear vs. anxiety are not mutually exclusive. To disambiguate how endogenous OT modulates fear and anxiety, an understudied area compared to exogenous OT, we survey behavioral studies utilizing OT receptor (OTR) antagonists. Based on emerging evidence about the role of OTR in rat dorsolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and elsewhere, we postulate that OT plays a critical role in facilitating accurate discrimination between stimuli representing threat and safety.

Last, we explore the limited literature on endogenous OT and its interaction with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) with a special emphasis on the dorsolateral BNST, which may hold the key to the neurobiology of phasic fear and sustained anxiety.","[Janecek, Michael; Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA; [Dabrowska, Joanna] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Neurosci, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA",,"Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Cellular & Mol Pharmacol, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.; Dabrowska, J (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Chicago Med Sch, Dept Neurosci, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",joanna.dabrowska@rosalindfranklin.edu,,"Janecek, Michael/0000-0001-5348-2785","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH113007]; DePaul-RFUMS seed research grant; Chicago Medical School, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH113007] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Rachyl Shanker, CMS'20 from the Dabrowska Lab for the image of PKC-STEP double-immunolabeling in the BNST<INF>dl</INF>.

Recently, in addition to direct effects, it has been shown that indirect (non-lethal) effects of predation risk are predominant in many populations. Predation risk is often structured in space and time, generating a heterogeneous landscape of fear within which animals can minimize risks by modifying their habitat use. Furthermore, for ungulates, resource quality seems to be positively correlated with human-related sources of risk. We studied the trade-off between access to resources of high-quality and risk-taking by contrasting habitat use of roe deer during daytime with that during nighttime for 94 roe deer in a hunted population. Our first hypothesis was that roe deer should avoid human disturbance by modifying their habitat use during daytime compared to nighttime. Our results supported this, as roe deer mainly used open fields during nighttime, but used more forested habitats during daytime, when human disturbance is higher. Moreover, we found that diel patterns in habitat use were influenced by hunting disturbance. Indeed, the roe deer decreased their use of high-crops during daytime, an important source of cover and food, during the hunting season. The proximity of roads and dwellings also affected habitat use, since roe deer used open fields during daytime to a greater extent when the distance to these sources of disturbance was higher. Hence, our results suggest that roe deer resolve the trade-off between the acquisition of high-quality resources and risk avoidance by modifying their habitat use between day and night.","[Bonnot, Nadege; Morellet, Nicolas; Verheyden, Helene; Cargnelutti, Bruno; Lourtet, Bruno; Hewison, A.

Differentiating between a child's experience of fear and pain is critical to appropriate intervention. There is no gold standard one-item self-report measure of fear for use with children. Objective: To conduct an initial investigation of the psychometric properties of the Children's Fear Scale (CFS; based on the adult Faces Anxiety Scale) with young school-age children. Method: Children and their parents were filmed during venipuncture and completed pain and fear ratings immediately after the procedure (n = 100) and 2 weeks later (n = 48). Behavioral coding of the procedures was conducted. Results: Support was found for interrater reliability (Time 1: r(s) = .51, p < .001) and test-retest reliability (r(s) = .76, p < .001) of the CFS for measuring children's fear during venipuncture. Assessment of construct validity revealed high concurrent convergent validity with another self-report measure of fear (Time 1: r(s) = .73, p < .001) and moderate discriminant validity (e. g., Time 1: r(s) = -.30, p < .005 with child coping behavior; r(s) = .41, p < .001 with child distress behavior). Conclusions: The CFS holds promise for measuring pain-related fear in children. In addition to further investigation into the psychometric properties of the CFS during acute pain with a wider age range, future research could validate this measure in other contexts. The utility of a one-item measure of fear extends beyond the field of pediatric pain to other contexts including intervention for anxiety disorders and children in hospital.","[McMurtry, C.

Instructed extinction involves informing participants before extinction that the unconditional stimulus (US) will no longer be presented. This manipulation has been shown to abolish fear conditioned to fear-irrelevant conditional stimuli, but is said to leave fear conditioned to images of snakes and spiders intact. The latter finding, however, has only been demonstrated when fear-relevance is manipulated between-groups. It is also not known whether instructed extinction affects fear conditioned to ontogenetic fear-relevant stimuli, such as pointed guns. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that fear conditioned to images of pointed guns does not resist instructed extinction. In Experiment 2, we detected some evidence to suggest that fear conditioned to images of snakes and spiders survives instructed extinction but this evidence was not conclusive. In Experiment 3, we directly compared the effects of instructed extinction on fear conditioned to snakes and spiders and to guns and provide strong evidence that fear conditioned to both classes of stimuli is reduced after instructed extinction with no differences between ontogenetic and phylogenetic stimuli. The current results suggest that when fear relevance is manipulated within-participants fear conditioned to both phylogenetic and ontogenetic, fear-relevant stimuli responds to instructed extinction providing evidence in favor of a socio-cultural explanation for preparedness effects.","[Luck, Camilla C.; Patterson, Rachel R.; Lipp, Ottmar V.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",,"Luck, CC (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",c.luck@curtin.edu.au,"; Lipp, Ottmar/A-1254-2007","Luck, Camilla/0000-0002-9364-1418; Lipp, Ottmar/0000-0001-6734-8608","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP180100869, SR120300015]","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP180100869 and SR120300015",,43,2,2,4,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,APR,2020,57,4,,,,,,,e13516,10.1111/psyp.13516,,DEC 2019,19,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,KU3OF,WOS:000502253100001,31828815,"Bronze, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2022-03-23,

What Americans feared was in fact fear itself. Examining Sigmund Freud and Roberto Esposito's theories about anxiety and immunity, this article argues that fear of fear itself, a paradoxical objectless fear, symptomatically reveals the productive power of fear, which searches for an object to be dreaded from others, such as foreigners, immigrants, and racial minorities. This article, in this sense, (mis)construes that Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous 1933 inaugural fear itself speech is not a rhetorical gesture intended to emphasize the ungroundedness of Depression-era American fear, but a veiled call for generating a displaced object of fear that will enable contemporary Americans to find ways of coping with anxiety.","[Jung, Yeonsik] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",,"Jung, Y (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",apiaceres@skku.edu,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5A8018982],This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2017S1A5A8018982).,,37,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0324-4652,1588-2810,,NEOHELICON,Neohelicon,JUN,2019,46,1,,,,,213,225,,10.1007/s11059-018-0441-1,,,13,Literature,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Literature,HY9OM,WOS:000468470900016,,,,,2022-03-23,

Rather, the acoustic parameters affected by emotion vary depending on the emotion type. In this context, the emotion-based variability of acoustic parameters is still a current field of study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the acoustic parameters that fear affects and the extent of their influence. For this purpose, various acoustic parameters were obtained from speech records containing fear and neutral emotions. The change according to the emotional states of these parameters was analyzed using statistical methods, and the parameters and the degree of influence that the fear emotion affected were determined. According to the results obtained, the majority of acoustic parameters that fear affects vary according to the used data.

Prior work has resulted in a good understanding of both the molecular mechanisms and neural circuits supporting this form of learning. However, much of what is known about these mechanisms comes from studies in which fear memory is acquired using a single, isolated training session. Given that we cannot divorce the acquisition of new information from the backdrop on which it occurs, studies are needed to determine how the acquisition of fear memory is affected by other learning events. Here, we used rats to describe the time course by which auditory fear conditioning can facilitate learning to a different fear learning event, which alone is insufficient to support long-term fear memory. First, we replicated previous findings showing that although a single trial of light and shock produces little evidence of memory, two identical trials spaced 60 min or 24 h apart support long-term memory. Next, we report that a typical auditory fear conditioning session facilitated memory formation when rats were subsequently exposed to a single trial of light and shock 60 min or 24 h, but not 4 min, later. Finally, we show that learning can be enhanced retroactively if auditory fear conditioning occurs 60 min, but not 24 h, after a single light-shock pairing. These data demonstrate that a weak fear conditioning trial can be enhanced by prior and subsequent fear conditioning depending on the timing between training events.","[Lee, Jessica; Russo, Amanda S.; Parsons, Ryan G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",,"Parsons, RG (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",ryan.parsons@stonybrook.edu,,"Russo, Amanda/0000-0002-3436-0034; Parsons, Ryan/0000-0001-8136-9413",Stony Brook University,This work was supported by funds from Stony Brook University.

Recent work has demonstrated generalization (i.e., transfer) of conditioned fear across perceptual dimensions and conceptual categories, but it is not clear how fear generalization influences other cognitive processes. The current study investigated how associative fear learning impacts higher-order visuospatial attention, specifically in terms of attentional bias toward generalized threats (i.e., the heightened assessment of potentially dangerous stimuli). We combined discriminative fear conditioning of color stimuli with a subsequent visual search task, in which targets and distractors were presented inside colored circles that varied in perceptual similarity to the fear-conditioned color. Skin conductance responses validated the fear-conditioning manipulation. Search response times indicated that attention was preferentially deployed not just to the specific fear-conditioned color, but also to similar colors that were never paired with the aversive shock. Furthermore, this attentional bias decreased continuously and symmetrically from the fear-conditioned value along the color spectrum, indicating a generalization gradient based on perceptual similarity. These results support functional accounts of fear learning that promote broad, defensive generalization of attentional bias toward threat.","[Dowd, Emma Wu; Mitroff, Stephen R.; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Room B203,LSRC Bldg,Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Mitroff, Stephen R.] George Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"LaBar, KS (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Room B203,LSRC Bldg,Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",klabar@duke.edu,,"Dowd, Emma Wu/0000-0003-0219-8527",,,,42,5,6,0,37,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,1931-1516,,EMOTION,Emotion,OCT,2016,16,7,,,,,1011,1018,,10.1037/emo0000197,,,8,"Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology,DY9FE,WOS:000385438300009,27213724,,,,2022-03-23,

Previous studies indicated that the acid sensing ion channel ASIC1 a influences fear behavior in conditioning paradigms. However,these differences may have resulted from an ASIC1 a effect on learning, memory, or the expression of fear. Methods: To test the hypothesis that ASIC1a influences the expression of fear or anxiety independent of classical conditioning, we examined the effects of disrupting the mouse ASIC1a gene on unconditioned fear in the open field test, unconditioned acoustic startle, and fear evoked by the predator odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT). In addition, we tested the effects of acutely inhibiting ASIC1 a with PcTx, an ASIC1a antagonist in tarantula venom. Our immunohistochemistry suggested ASIC1a is expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdala, and periaqueductal gray, which are thought to play important roles in the generation and expression of innate fear. Therefore, we also tested whether ASIC1 a disruption altered c-fos expression in these structures following TMT exposure. Results: We found that the loss of ASIC1 a reduced fear in the open field test, reduced acoustic startle, and inhibited the fear response to TMT. Similarly, intracerebroventricular administration of PcTx reduced TMT-evoked freezing in ASIC1a(+/+) mice but not ASIC1a(-/-) mice.

Predators affect prey by killing them directly (lethal effects) and by inducing costly antipredator behaviours in living prey (risk effects). Risk effects can strongly influence prey populations and cascade through trophic systems. A prerequisite for assessing risk effects is characterizing the spatiotemporal variation in predation risk. 2. Risk effects research has experienced rapid growth in the last several decades. However, preliminary assessments of the resultant literature suggest that researchers characterize predation risk using a variety of techniques. The implications of this methodological variation for inference and comparability among studies have not been well recognized or formally synthesized. 3. We couple a literature survey with a hierarchical framework, developed from established theory, to quantify the methodological variation in characterizing risk using carnivore-ungulate systems as a case study. Via this process, we documented 244 metrics of risk from 141 studies falling into at least 13 distinct subcategories within three broader categories. 4. Both empirical and theoretical work suggest risk and its effects on prey constitute a complex, multi-dimensional process with expressions varying by spatiotemporal scale. Our survey suggests this multi-scale complexity is reflected in the literature as a whole but often underappreciated in any given study, which complicates comparability among studies and leads to an overemphasis on documenting the presence of risk effects rather than their mechanisms or scale of influence. 5. We suggest risk metrics be placed in a more concrete conceptual framework to clarify inference surrounding risk effects and their cascading effects throughout ecosystems. We recommend studies (i) take a multi-scale approach to characterizing risk; (ii) explicitly consider 'true' predation risk (probability of predation per unit time); and (iii) use risk metrics that facilitate comparison among studies and the evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses. Addressing the pressing questions in risk effects research, including how, to what extent and on what scale they occur, requires leveraging the advantages of the many methods available to characterize risk while minimizing the confusion caused by variability in their application.","[Moll, Remington J.; Redilla, Kyle M.; Mudumba, Tutilo; Muneza, Arthur B.; Gray, Steven M.; Abade, Leandro; Montgomery, Robert A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 480 Wilson Rd,Room 13 Nat Resources Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Muneza, Arthur B.] Giraffe Conservat Fdn, POB 51061 GPO, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Abade, Leandro] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England; [Hayward, Matt W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hayward, Matt W.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Hayward, Matt W.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, X001, Pretoria, South Africa; [Millspaugh, Joshua J.] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",,"Moll, RJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 480 Wilson Rd,Room 13 Nat Resources Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",rjmoll@msu.edu,"Hayward, Matt W./F-3569-2010; Montgomery, Robert A./C-5541-2019","Hayward, Matt W./0000-0002-5574-1653; Redilla, Kyle/0000-0002-3052-373X; Montgomery, Robert A./0000-0001-5894-0589",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Michigan State University MasterCard Foundation; CNPq-BrasilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); University of Montana,"We thank the following for support: the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (R.J.M.); the Michigan State University MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program (A.B.M.), CNPq-Brasil (L.A.) and the University of Montana Boone and Crockett Program (J.J.M.).

Given the high comorbidity between OCD and anxiety, OCD symptom clusters may more broadly associate with fear and/or distress internalizing constructs. This study examines fear and distress dimensions, including physical concerns (fear), separation anxiety (fear), perfectionism (distress), and anxious coping (distress), as predictors of previously empirically-derived OCD symptom clusters in a sample of 215 youth diagnosed with primary OCD (ages 7-17, mean age = 12.25). Self-reported separation fears predicted membership in Cluster 1 (aggressive, sexual, religious, somatic obsessions, and checking compulsions) while somatic/autonomic fears predicted membership in Cluster 2 (symmetry obsessions and ordering, counting, repeating compulsions). Results highlight the diversity of pediatric OCD symptoms and their differential association with fear, suggesting the need to carefully assess both OCD and global fear constructs that might be directly targeted in treatment.","[Rozenman, Michelle; Peris, Tara; Bergman, R.

Most studies examine these changes in nondiscriminative fear conditioning paradigms. Using a discriminative fear, safety, and reward conditioning task, Sangha et al. (2013) have previously reported several neural microcircuits within the basal amygdala (BA) which discriminate among these cues, including a subpopulation of neurons responding selectively to a safety cue and not a fear cue. Here, the hypothesis that these safety neurons isolated during discriminative conditioning are biased to become fear cue responsive as a result of extinction, when fear behavior diminishes, was tested. Although 41% of safety neurons became fear cue responsive as a result of extinction, the data revealed that there was no bias for these neurons to become preferentially responsive during fear extinction compared to the other identified subgroups. In addition to the plasticity seen in the safety neurons, 44% of neurons unresponsive to either the fear cue or safety cue during discriminative conditioning became fear cue responsive during extinction. Together these emergent responses to the fear cue as a result of extinction support the hypothesis that new learning underlies extinction. In contrast, 47% of neurons responsive to the fear cue during discriminative conditioning became unresponsive to the fear cue during extinction. These findings are consistent with a suppression of neural responding mediated by inhibitory learning, or, potentially, by direct unlearning. Together, the data support extinction as an active process involving both gains and losses of responses to the fear cue and suggests the final output of the integrated BA circuit in influencing fear behavior is a balance of excitation and inhibition, and perhaps reversal of learning induced changes.","[Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sangha, Susan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ernest Gallo Clin, Emeryville, CA USA; [Sangha, Susan] Univ Calif San Francisco, Res Ctr, Emeryville, CA USA",,"Sangha, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sangha@purdue.edu,,"Sangha, Susan/0000-0002-6461-4146",State of California for Medical Research on Alcohol and Substance Abuse through the University of California at San Francisco; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AA014925]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA014925] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by funding from the State of California for Medical Research on Alcohol and Substance Abuse through the University of California at San Francisco and NIH grant AA014925 to Dr. P.

Preliminary evidence suggests that excessive fear generalization is a pathogenic feature of anxiety disorders, however, it remains unclear how fear generalization affects pathological avoidance. The current study thus aimed to examine the link between categorical fear generalization and costly avoidance. By combining a fear acquisition training phase and an avoidance test, the current findings showed that acquired fear spreads to novel stimuli that belonged to the same category of the original fear-related stimuli, but not to those that belonged to the fear-irrelevant categories. Importantly, participants avoided these fear-related novel stimuli despite costs. The current findings indicate that categorical fear generalization triggers costly avoidance. In terms of clinical implication, a decrease in costly avoidance aligned with a decrease in US expectancies. This emphasizes that behavioral approach may initiate extinction learning.","[Wong, Alex H.

Departing from the theory on emotional appraisal coming from psychology, this study investigates which factors that modulate worry and fear associated with the presence of ticks among livestock owners of sheep and/or cattle. Methods: Survey data from 775 livestock owners in Norway were analysed by hierarchical multiple regression analysis with an index of fear of tick-borne diseases among livestock as the outcome variable. Results: Twenty-nine per cent of the livestock owners reported worry and fear of tick-borne diseases among their livestock. The model explained 35% of the variance in worry and fear. There was a weak association between esti-mated incidences of tick-borne diseases in livestock and livestock owners'worry and fear. Whereas previous personal experience of ticks and tick-borne diseases in livestock, and the livestock owners' appraisals of the situation were more strongly associated with relatively stronger feelings of worry and fear. Conclusions: Livestock owners'worry and fear of tick-borne diseases in livestock can partly be understood as their appraisals of perceived personal relevance of the presence of ticks, its potential negative implications for their daily life at large, and what potential they have to cope by different strategies to adapt or adjust to the situation.","[Johansson, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Environm Psychol, Lund, Sweden; [Mysterud, Atle] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Oslo, Norway; [Flykt, Anders] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Psychol, S-83125 Ostersund, Sweden",,"Johansson, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Architecture & Built Environm, Environm Psychol, Lund, Sweden.",maria.johansson@mpe.lth.se,,,Lund University - Research Council of Norway [254694],Open access funding provided by Lund University.

Given the beneficial effects of model-based safety learning (i.e. vicarious extinction) in preventing the recovery of short-term fear memory, we examined whether consolidated long-term fear memories could be updated with safety learning accomplished through vicarious extinction learning initiated within the reconsolidation time-window. We assessed this in a final sample of 19 participants that underwent a three-day within-subject fear-conditioning design, using fear-potentiated startle as our primary index of fear learning. Methods: On day 1, two fear-relevant stimuli (reinforced CSs) were paired with shock (US) and a third stimulus served as a control (CS). On day 2, one of the two previously reinforced stimuli (the reminded CS) was presented once in order to reactivate the fear memory 10 min before vicarious extinction training was initiated for all CSs. The recovery of the fear memory was tested 24 h later. Results and conclusion: Vicarious extinction training conducted within the reconsolidation time window specifically prevented the recovery of the reactivated fear memory (p = 0.03), while leaving fear potentiated startle responses to the non-reactivated cue intact (p = 0.62). These findings are relevant to both basic and clinical research, suggesting that a safe, non-invasive model-based exposure technique has the potential to enhance the efficiency and durability of anxiolytic therapies.

An insight into how and why species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The West European hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats. This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, Meles meles) abundance. Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our results suggest that agricultural habitats may be 'landscapes of fear' for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by, among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour and species conservation.

However, human data on the relation between testosterone, fear, and anxiety have predominantly involved questionnaires that index cortically executed conscious appraisal of anxious mood. Animal studies, on the other band, indicate that the effects of testosterone on motivation and emotion are of subcortical origin and of unconscious nature. Presently, it was hypothesized that a single testosterone administration to humans would reduce unconscious fear but not consciously experienced anxiety. Methods: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design, a single dose of testosterone (.5 mg) or placebo was administered to 16 healthy female volunteers. Afterward, a masked emotional Stroop task measured unconscious emotional responses to fearful faces, while multiple self-reports of mood indexed consciously experienced anxiety. Results: As hypothesized, the habitual vigilant emotional response to the masked fearful face observed in the placebo condition was significantly reduced after testosterone was administered, while the self-reported measures of anxiety remained unaffected. Conclusions: These data provide the first direct evidence for fear-reducing properties of testosterone in humans. Furthermore, by dissociating specific aspects of fear and anxiety in humans, this outcome highlights that testosterone's effects on motivation and emotion concern the subcortical affective pathways of the brain.","Univ Utrecht, Helmholtz Res Inst, Affect Neurosci Sect, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Med Ctr, Rudolf Magnus Inst Neurosci, Dept Psychiat, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"van Honk, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Helmholtz Res Inst, Affect Neurosci Sect, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",J.vanhonk@fss.uu.nl,,,,,,90,187,189,8,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0006-3223,1873-2402,,BIOL PSYCHIAT,Biol.

Methods: This cross-sectional study surveyed a convenience sample of 201 adolescents at a large, county hospital. Results: Over 75% of adolescents perceived fear. Younger and older adolescents, similar in fears, were distinguished only by parity. The effects of parity, overall rating of fear, and father of baby absence were found to vary by age on birth appraisal; however, only parity varied by age on IES scores. Conclusions: All age adolescents can be fearful and will benefit with childbirth education and labor support to help reduce fears and subsequent PBT. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the top fears midwives in Australia and New Zealand hold when it comes to caring for childbearing women. Method: From 2009 to 2011, 17 workshops were held in Australia and New Zealand supporting over 700 midwives develop skills to keep birth normal. During the workshop midwives were asked to write their top fear on a piece of paper and return it to the presenters. Similar concepts were grouped together to form 8 major categories. Findings: In total 739 fears were reported and these were death of a baby (n = 177), missing something that causes harm (n = 176), obstetric emergencies (n = 114), maternal death (n = 83), being watched (n = 68), being the cause of a negative birth experience (n = 52), dealing with the unknown (n = 36) and losing passion and confidence around normal birth (n = 32). Student midwives were more concerned about knowing what to do, while homebirth midwives were mostly concerned with being blamed if something went wrong. Conclusion: There was consistency between the 17 groups of midwives regarding top fears held. Supporting midwives with workshops such as dealing with grief and loss and managing fear could help reduce their anxiety. Obstetric emergency skills workshops may help midwives feel more confident, especially those dealing with shoulder dystocia and PPH as they were most commonly recorded.

In the laboratory, relapse is modeled as return of conditioned fear responses after successful fear extinction and is explained by insufficient retrieval and/or expression of the fear-inhibitory extinction memory that is generated during extinction learning. We have shown in mice and humans that return of fear can be prevented by administration of a single dose of the dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) immediately after extinction. In mice, this effect could be attributed to an enhancement of extinction memory consolidation. In our human study, we could not exclude that L-DOPA might have acted by interfering with the consolidation of the original fear memory. In the present study, we therefore used a combined differential cue and context conditioning paradigm where initial fear conditioning and extinction were conducted one day apart, in analogy to previous mouse studies. L-DOPA (N=21) or placebo (N=19) were administered after extinction, precluding any action on fear memory consolidation. In the return-of-fear test conducted one week later, drug effects on conditioned skin conductance responses were absent. However, we found evidence indicative of reduced neural activity, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the L-DOPA group in areas related to conditioned fear and return of fear (amygdala, posterior hippocampus) and enhanced activity in a key area of extinction retrieval/expression (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), relative to placebo controls. These findings require further corroboration in additional experiments. Implications for further investigations on the role of the dopamine system in extinction and on the neuropharmacological augmentation of extinction-based therapies are discussed.

In addition to seizure evolution amygdala kindling enhances emotionality. The relative roles of electrical stimulation and seizure induction in fear responding are unclear. Here we investigate this issue using extinction and reinstatement of fear-potentiated startle. After classical conditioning (light + footshock pairings) laboratory rats were fear extinguished with each light presentation followed by nonepileptogenic amygdala stimulation. In contrast to the normal extinction learning of control subjects, amygdala stimulated animals exhibited conditioned fear after 120 presentations of the nonreinforced conditioned stimulus (CS). In a second experiment electrical stimulation of the amygdala restored extinguished fear responding and the fear reinstatement was specific to extinction context. The reinstatement effect did not involve sensitized fear to the CS produced by amygdala stimulation. The possibility that electrical activation of the amygdala produces unconditioned fear was considered. Animals uniformly failed to demonstrate fear-potentiated startle using electrical stimulation of the amygdala as the unconditioned stimulus. This was the case with a subthreshold afterdischarge stimulus and a stimulation schedule that produced kindled seizures. The extinction deficit and fear reinstatement results were interpreted to suggest that amygdala stimulation activates acquired excitatory stimulus-affect neural connections formed during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Our data supports a model in which excitation of an amygdala-based memory-retrieval system reinforces the expression of learned fear behaviors. (C) 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Exposure therapy is based on extinction learning and is widely used to treat fear-related disorders, but its effect on remote fear memory is modest. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from Coptis chinensis or Berberis spp., has been recently reported to exert a diversity of pharmacological effects on the central nervous system, such as facilitating extinction of drug memory. Here, we explored the effect of berberine on extinction of fear memory using a classical contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm, which is Pavlovian conditioning, can rapidly create fear memories related to contexts. Twenty-four hours or 30 days after CFC training, mice were subjected to context extinction (10 days) to extinguish their behaviors and treated with 12.5 or 25 mg/kg berberine intragastrically 1 or 6 h after each extinction session, followed by reinstatement and spontaneous recovery tests. The results showed that intragastric administration of 25 mg/kg berberine 1 h after extinction significantly promoted the extinction of recent and remote fear memories and prevented reinstatement and spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear in mice. These findings indicate that berberine combined with extinction training could serve as a promising novel avenue for the treatment of fear-related disorders.","[Huang, Shihao; Wu, Feilong; Shi, Cuijie; Yang, Chang; Luo, Yixiao] Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Med, Key Lab Mol Epidemiol Hunan Prov, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yu] Yiyang Med Coll, Yiyang, Peoples R China; [Yan, He; Chen, Liangpei] Cent South Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Forens Sci, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chang; Luo, Yixiao] Hunan Normal Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, China Hunan Prov Peoples Hosp, Changsh, Peoples R China",,"Yang, C; Luo, YX (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Med, Key Lab Mol Epidemiol Hunan Prov, Changsha, Peoples R China.; Yang, C; Luo, YX (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, China Hunan Prov Peoples Hosp, Changsh, Peoples R China.",yangchang2370@126.com; luoyx@hunnu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81771434]; Outstanding Innovative Youth Training Program of Changsha [kq2106032],Funding The present research received support from Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81771434) and Outstanding Innovative Youth Training Program of Changsha (kq2106032).,,77,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1663-9812,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

Previous animal based studies showed that the activity of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) are involved in memory modulation. However in humans it is not clear that whether genetic variability in beta-ARs contributes to individual differences of fear and extinction memory. In the current study, we investigated the role of a common single-nucleotide polymorphism of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene in fear memory acquisition, fear memory extinction, extinction recall and fear generalization in human participants. Ninety-one male participants were exposed to a Pavlovian fear conditioning and their fear responses were assessed by the skin conductance response. Participants were genotyped for a polymorphism (r52400207) located within the promoter region of the human ADRB2. Differences between genotypes were observed in the extinction memory recall test but not in fear acquisition, extinction learning and fear generalization. Particularly, A-allele carriers of rs2400707 displayed successful retention of extinction memory and prevented the return of fear during recall test. The results revealed the involvement of human noradrenergic system in the retention of extinction memory and genetic variability in this system may underlie individual differences in PTSD. Furthermore, r52400207 polymorphism of ADRB2 gene may play a key role in the treatment efficacy of PTSD and can be a basis for future studies investigating a personalized medicine for fear memory related disorders.","[Shi, Le; Chen, Si-Jing; Deng, Jia-Hui; Que, Jian-Yu; Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Univ Hosp 6, Peking Univ Inst Mental Hlth,Minist Hlth, Key Lab Mental Hlth,Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Diso, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Si-Jing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiao] Peking Univ, Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yan; Bao, Yan-Ping; Shi, Jie] Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Shi, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Natl Inst Drug Dependence, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Peking Univ Hosp 6, Natl Clin Res Ctr Mental Disorders, Inst Mental Hlth, 51 Huayuan Bei Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",shijie@bjmu.edu.cn; linlu@bjmu.edu.cn,,"Bao, Yanping/0000-0002-1881-0939",National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB856400]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology CommissionBeijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z151100003915121]; National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2015BAI13B01]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81521063],"This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (no. 2015CB856400), Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (no.

The SOS attempts to merge ecological models that define a repertoire of contextually relevant threat induced survival behaviors with contemporary approaches to human affective science. We first propose that the goal of the nervous system is to reduce surprise and optimize actions by (i) predicting the sensory landscape by simulating possible encounters with threat and selecting the appropriate pre-encounter action and (ii) prevention strategies in which the organism manufactures safe environments. When a potential threat is encountered the (iii) threat orienting system is engaged to determine whether the organism ignores the stimulus or switches into a process of (iv) threat assessment, where the organism monitors the stimulus, weighs the threat value, predicts the actions of the threat, searches for safety, and guides behavioral actions crucial to directed escape. When under imminent attack, (v) defensive systems evoke fast reflexive indirect escape behaviors (i.e., fight or flight). This cascade of responses to threat of increasing magnitude are underwritten by an interconnected neural architecture that extends from cortical and hippocampal circuits, to attention, action and threat systems including the amygdala, striatum, and hard wired defensive systems in the midbrain. The SOS also includes a modulatory feature consisting of cognitive appraisal systems that flexibly guide perception, risk and action. Moreover, personal and vicarious threat encounters fine-tune avoidance behaviors via model-based learning, with higher organisms bridging data to reduce face-to-face encounters with predators. Our model attempts to unify the divergent field of human affective science, proposing a highly integrated nervous system that has evolved to increase the organism's chances of survival.","[Mobbs, Dean; Hagan, Cindy C.; Silston, Brian; Prevost, Charlotte] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dalgleish, Tim] MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge, England",,"Mobbs, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, Fear Anxiety & Biosocial Behav Lab, 406 Schermertorn Hall,1190 Amsterdam Ave,MC 5501, New York, NY 10027 USA.",dmobbs@psych.columbia.edu,"Dalgleish, Tim/E-8341-2010","Dalgleish, Tim/0000-0002-7304-2231; Hagan, Cindy/0000-0002-4576-7120; Silston, Brian/0000-0002-3365-0013",Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [MC_U105579215] Funding Source: Medline,,,223,146,150,4,60,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-453X,,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

The seven-item FCV-19S was used to assess fear regarding COVID-19 on a five-point Likert scale. The mean score for the responses was calculated and compared based on demographic variables. A comparison of low and high levels of fear and a multiple logistic regression analysis of levels of fear with demographic variables were conducted.p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study population comprised 45.6% (683) males and 54.4% (816) females, with approximately 68% belonging to the age group of 20-40 years.

The findings of this study may help to identify the groups most at risk and formulate tailor-made intervention strategies to ensure their optimal health in this time of global crisis.","[Doshi, Dolar; Sukhabogi, Jagadeeswara Rao] Govt Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth Dent, Room 311, Hyderabad, India; [Karunakar, Parupalli] Panineeya Inst Dent Sci & Hosp, Dept Conservat Dent & Endodont, Hyderabad, India; [Prasanna, Jammula Surya] Panineeya Inst Dent Sci & Hosp, Dept Periodont, Hyderabad, India; [Mahajan, Sheshadri Vishnu] BMC, Dept Ophthalmol, Hyderabad, India",,"Doshi, D (corresponding author), Govt Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth Dent, Room 311, Hyderabad, India.",doshidolar@yahoo.com,"Doshi, Dolar/Y-6907-2019",,,,,15,62,63,5,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1557-1874,1557-1882,,INT J MENT HEALTH AD,Int.

We examined whether a CS- presented during acquisition or extinction that predicted the absence of the unconditional stimulus (US) could act as a temporal context cue, reducing or enhancing responding, in differential fear conditioning. Two groups received acquisition (CSx-US, CSa-noUS) in phase 1 and extinction (CSx-noUS; CSe-noUS) in phase 2 (AE groups), and two groups received extinction in phase 1 and acquisition in phase 2 (EA groups). After a delay, participants were presented with either CSa (AEa and EAa groups) or CSe (AEe and EAe groups). Responding to CSx was enhanced after presentation of CSa but reduced after presentation of CSe, suggesting that training was segmented into two learning episodes and that the unreinforced CS present during an episode retrieved the CSx-US or CSx-noUS association. These findings suggest that temporal context cues may enhance or reduce fear responding, providing an exciting new avenue for relapse prevention research.","[Luck, Camilla C.; Green, Luke J.

For example, fear has been identified as a predictor of social anxiety problems, but no work has examined whether social and nonsocial fear make independent contributions to risk. We investigated the extent to which early social and nonsocial fear were associated with socially anxious behaviors during kindergarten. To do this, we identified distinct trajectories of social and nonsocial fear across toddlerhood and preschool. Only social fear was associated with socially anxious behaviors at ages 2 and 5. Because the ability to regulate fear contributes to the degree to which fearful children are at risk for anxiety problems, we also tested whether an early developing aspect of self-regulation modulated associations between early fear and kindergarten socially anxious behaviors. Specifically, we tested whether inhibitory control differentially modulated associations between early levels of social and nonsocial fear and socially anxious behaviors during kindergarten. Associations between trajectories of early social fear and age 5 socially anxious behaviors were moderated by individual differences in inhibitory control. Consistent with previous research showing associations between overcontrol and anxiety symptoms, more negative outcomes were observed when stable, high levels of social fear across childhood were coupled with high levels of inhibitory control. Results suggest that the combination of social fear and overcontrol reflect a profile of early risk for the development of social inhibition and social anxiety problems.","[Brooker, Rebecca J.] Montana State Univ, Dept Psychol, POB 173440, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Kiel, Elizabeth J.] Miami Univ, Dept Psychol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Buss, Kristin A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Brooker, RJ (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Psychol, POB 173440, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",rebecca.brooker@montana.edu,"Kiel, Elizabeth/AAV-3272-2020",,"National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R03 MH67797, R01 MH75750, K01 MH100240]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R15 HD076158]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R15HD076158] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K01MH100240, R01MH075750, R03MH067797] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Data collection for this project was supported by R03 MH67797 and R01 MH75750 from the National Institute of Mental Health (PI: Buss).

Once a stimulus is learned to predict harm, it can elicit fear responses. Such learning can last a lifetime but is not always beneficial for an organism. For an organism to thrive in its environment, it must know when to engage in defensive, avoidance behaviors and when to engage in non-defensive, approach behaviors. Fear should be suppressed in situations that are not dangerous: when a novel, innocuous stimulus resembles a feared stimulus, when a feared stimulus no longer predicts harm, or when there is an option to avoid harm. A cardinal feature of anxiety disorders is the inability to suppress fear adaptively. In PTSD, for instance, learned fear is expressed inappropriately in safe situations and is resistant to extinction. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of suppressing fear responses during stimulus discrimination, fear extinction, and active avoidance, focusing on the well-studied tripartite circuit consisting of the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.","[Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Sangha, Susan] Purdue Univ, Purdue Inst Integrat Neurosci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Diehl, Maria M.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Bergstrom, Hadley C.] Vassar Coll, Dept Psychol Sci, Program Neurosci & Behav, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA; [Drew, Michael R.] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Drew, Michael R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Sangha, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Sangha, S (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Purdue Inst Integrat Neurosci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.; Diehl, MM (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.; Bergstrom, HC (corresponding author), Vassar Coll, Dept Psychol Sci, Program Neurosci & Behav, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA.; Drew, MR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Learning & Memory, Austin, TX 78712 USA.; Drew, MR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Neurosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",sangha@purdue.edu; maria.m.diehl@gmail.com; habergstrom@vassar.edu; mdrew@utexas.edu,"Diehl, Maria/L-6410-2019","Diehl, Maria/0000-0002-7370-6106; Sangha, Susan/0000-0002-6461-4146","NIMHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01-MH102595, R01 MH117426];  [NIMHR01-MH110425];  [NIAAAP50AA017823]",S.S. is supported by NIMHR01-MH110425; H.C.B. is supported by NIAAAP50AA017823; M.R.D. is supported by NIMH R01-MH102595 and R01 MH117426.,,192,28,28,3,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0149-7634,1873-7528,,NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R,Neurosci.

Thus, fear of COVID-19 and fear of terrorism as well as the associations with coping strategies and resilience were examined among Israelis living in conflict zones as well as Israelis living in the center, where exposure to security incidents is rare. Six hundred and fifteen Israeli adults (260 men and 356 women) were interviewed via the internet while Israel was under mandatory first lockdown. Fear of COVID-19 was found to be higher than fear of terrorism among both groups. those living in the conflict zones and those living in the central Israel. In contradiction to our assumption, we found that those who were living in a conflict zone did not exhibit higher levels of resilience and did not cope better when exposed to a new threat-even though they may be more skilled at ha
